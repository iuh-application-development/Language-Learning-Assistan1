She likes to play classical music,
but sometimes I get her to play rock music with me.
She is also a very good singer.
I like to sing with her.
We sing in harmony.
I listen to music all the time on the radio.
I know a lot of songs.
I can sing along with most of the songs that come on the radio.
I memorize the lyrics of the songs.
My sister and I sometimes get together and sing our favorite songs.
Maybe someday we will start our own rock band,
and I will be the drummer.

67,67. Spring,A2,67-spring,24,"It rains a lot in the spring.
The trees are full of buds,
and the flowers are starting to bloom.
My favorite spring flowers are tulips and daffodils.
The birds come back from the south.
I can always tell that spring is here
when I see my first robin of the season.
The robins pull worms from the wet ground.
When it isn't raining, my friends and I go outside and toss a ball around.
We look forward to the summer, but we are glad to get outside after the long winter.
The air smells so fresh in the spring.
My mother always tells me not to track mud into the house.
It's very muddy in our yard in the springtime.
I wipe my muddy feet before I go into the house.
There are a lot of puddles in my yard.
I sometimes splash in the puddles,
and I get wet and cold, so I have to go into the house.
I like it when the snow has melted, the rain has stopped, and the sun comes out.
On sunny days I always get together with my friends.
On those days we either ride our bikes or play ball.
My parents like to go for walks on spring evenings.
They also like to clean up the yard in the spring.
Everyone seems to be outside.
The springtime brings people out of their houses.

68,68. The birthday party,A1,68-the-birthday-party,29,"Yesterday I went to a birthday party.
My friend Jane had her tenth birthday.
Her house was decorated with balloons and streamers.
Her mother had baked a big birthday cake.
The cake had ""Happy tenth birthday Jane"" written on it.
There were ten candles on the cake.
Jane blew out the candles and made a wish.
I wonder what she wished for.
Your wish won't come true if you tell anyone what it was.
We sang ""Happy birthday to you"".
At the party we played some games.
I won one of the games so I got a prize.
We also swam in Jane's swimming pool.
Jane opened her gifts.
Her gifts were wrapped in bright paper and bows.
She got lots of nice gifts.
She got some compact discs, some clothes and some computer games.
Jane thanked everyone.
We ate a lot of food at Jane's party.
We had hot dogs.
I put mustard and ketchup on my hot dog.
Then we ate cake and ice cream.
We had pop to drink.
I think I had too much cake and ice cream.
I was very full by the time the party was over.
We thanked Jane and her mother before we all went home.
It was a very good party.
Everyone had a good time.
I hope Jane had a happy tenth birthday.

My teacher always has writing all over the blackboards.
Sometimes the chalk squeaks when she writes on the blackboard.
We cover our ears when that happens.
Our classroom is full of desks.
There are a lot of students in our class.
Our desks are full of books, notebooks and pens.
I try to keep my desk neat,
but I have a lot of things in there.
My ruler and pencils are always falling out of my desk.
At the back of the room is a bookcase full of books.
We can sign those books out and take them home to read.
I have read a lot of the books.
I like mysteries and biographies,
so I have taken many of those home.
There are also tables at the back of the room.
That's where we do our artwork.
We spread out big sheets of paper,
and use paints or crayons to make pictures.
Sometimes we cut things out of magazines with scissors
and we glue pictures to the paper.
I like art class.
After school, my friends and I often erase the blackboards for the teacher.
Then we take the erasers outside and clap them together to get the chalk dust out of them.
My friends and I walk home together
and talk about what we did in school
and what we're going to do after supper.

70,70. Vacation,A2,70-vacation,33,"My family and I went on vacation to Lake Huron.
The water is beautiful and blue there, and the sand is nice and white.
The week that we were there was very hot.
The sun was hot, but the water was still very cold.
I went swimming and tried to catch little fish in my hands.
I was careful not to get sunburned.
We stayed at a hotel that had a pool and a game room.
I played pinball and video games sometimes.
I liked to swim in the hotel pool, but I liked the beach better.
I would lie on a big beach towel and get warm,
then I would jump in the water and cool off.
Sometimes I would just lie on the sand
and watch the waves roll up on shore.
I found some seashells, and saw a crab walking on the sand.
At first I was a bit lonely because I didn't know anyone there.
It wasn't long before I met some other kids my age.
We built sandcastles together and swam in the lake.
The other kids were from different towns,
so we told each other stories about our schools and friends.
We found that we had a lot in common
even though we were from different places.
Our families got together and went to restaurants together.
We played volleyball on the beach, and we sat around a campfire at night and sang songs.
At the campfire we would roast marshmallows on a stick.
I always burn my marshmallows.
That is okay. I like them that way.
Mostly we just swam in the lake
until we were very tired.
I was sorry when our vacation was over.
I had a good time at Lake Huron.
I met some very good friends there.
We still write to each other.
Maybe we'll see each other next summer.

My father is very happy because they are his parents,
and he's glad that he will see them.
We don't see them very often because Calgary is a long way from Toronto.
My grandparents have two sons:
my father and my Uncle Bill.
Uncle Bill is married to my Aunt Susan.
They have a daughter who is my cousin.
My cousin is a lot older than I,
so we do not have a lot in common.
They also have a son who is the same age as me.
He is my favorite cousin
because we both like the same television shows
and the same games.
I have two brothers and one sister.
My brothers are both younger than I.
They are twins, so they have the same birthday.
My sister is one year older than I.
People say that my sister and I look alike.
We both have blonde hair and blue eyes.
My mother's parents live near us.

My uncle will often take my cousin and me to the movies.
I like to take my grandparents for walks
so they can see my school, and they can meet my friends.
My parents talk to my brothers and my sister and I a lot.

I can hardly wait for the ground to be covered with a blanket of white snow.
I put on my mittens, my scarf, my hat,
coat and winter boots, and I run out into the fluffy snow.
I have to be careful not to slip on the ice.
It can get very icy and cold in the winter.
The first thing that I do is to build a snowman.
I sometimes build a snow fort too.
My friends and I have a good snowball fight.
We laugh a lot, and our cheeks and noses get very red.
When we get too cold, we go into the house and have a cup of hot chocolate.
My father fills the backyard with water that freezes and turns into an ice rink.
When the ice is hard enough,
my friends and I get our skates and we go out on the ice to play hockey.
All of my friends own hockey sticks.
I am usually the goalie,
and I have to keep the puck from going into the net.
My sister and her friends don't really like to play hockey.
They would rather just skate around on the ice.
I took skating lessons, so I don't usually fall down.
My little brother is just learning to skate,
so he falls down a lot.
My father has to shovel the snow off the paths and the driveway in the winter.
I help him.
Shovelling snow is hard work.
When my dad and I finish shovelling the driveway,
we go into the house and warm our hands and feet in front of the fireplace.
There is probably nothing more beautiful than fresh fallen snow on the trees.
In the morning, when the sun shines on the snow, it glistens.
I like to leave my footprints in the snow.
Winter can be very beautiful and exciting.

Some of them are scary, and some of them are funny.
We go from door to door and say ""Trick or treat""
and people give us candies.
We wear masks on our faces, and we have a lot of fun.
The autumn winds start to blow.
The wind blows the leaves right off the trees
until the trees have bare branches.
My friends and I have a lot of fun outside before the winter leaves us shivering.
We play football and soccer at school.
After school, we ride our bikes through the piles of dry leaves.
The leaves go flying through the air as we drive through them.
My parents rake the leaves up
and put them in a big pile.
I like to jump in the big piles of leaves,
but then my parents just have to rake them up again.
The skies get a little cloudier in the autumn,
and we know that soon there will be snow,
so we enjoy the brisk autumn weather while we can.

We will have dessert too.
Some of my family like Christmas pudding,
but I will just have ice cream.
Last year some carolers came to the door.
It was snowing outside.
They stood in the snow and sang Christmas carols to us.
My father gave them some money,
and my mother gave them some hot chocolate to warm them up.
They had lovely voices, and they sang some of my favorite carols.
We also collect food, gifts and money
for some of the people in town who cannot afford to have Christmas.
My family is collecting things for a poor family who live near here.
We had fun deciding which toys to buy for the children in that family.
It was a good feeling to share with people who do not have as much as you do.
My parents have always taught us that Christmas is a time for giving, not receiving.
I think they're right.

84,84. Pretending,B1,84-pretending,31,"I like to pretend. I like to make up things that aren't real.
I use my imagination.
I was pretending that I was in a time machine.
I set the date for a prehistoric time.
I turned on the time machine, and it buzzed and whirred and spun madly.
When it stopped spinning, I opened the door and stepped out into a very thick jungle.
I listened carefully to the sounds of the jungle.
I could hear strange animal noises, and the leaves were rustling.
I wasn't sure if I'd gone back in time or had just landed in a jungle somewhere in the twenty-first century.
It didn't take me long to realize that I had indeed gone back in time.
A very strange bird-like creature with a large beak flew overhead.
I'd never seen anything like it in my life.
I took a few steps out into the long grass and ferns.
I didn't wanna go too far away from my time machine.
I heard a noise over on my right side.
There was a man who looked quite different from me.
He was dressed in an animal skin, and he carried a big stick.
I didn't want him to see me, so I hid behind a tree.
He didn't speak any language that I could understand.
He grunted at someone who must have been in the distance.
Then, I felt the earth shake beneath my feet.
I heard giant thumps on the ground as the floor of the jungle shook.
The man in the animal skin began to run.
I saw why he was running.
A giant dinosaur appeared above the tops of the trees.
It was bigger than anything I had ever seen.
My heart began to pound in my chest. It was coming toward me.
I ran toward my time machine and jumped in.
I set the dial for the twenty-first century.
The machine whirred and buzzed. My time machine landed in the twenty-first century.
I got away just in time.

We went to the hospital to visit my aunt and to see the new baby.
My aunt was feeling fine, although she was just a bit tired.
She walked with us to a big window that had lots of babies behind it.
She pointed to a crib with a baby in it.
The baby was wrapped in a pink blanket.
We all said how pretty the baby looked.
I couldn't believe how tiny the baby was.
She was asleep, so we couldn't see her eyes.
When the baby went home, we went to visit her.
We heard the baby. She was crying.
My aunt said the baby was hungry.
My aunt had a baby bottle full of warm milk.
She fed the baby with it.
The baby was happy after that.
My aunt patted the baby on the back until the baby burped,
and then the baby fell asleep.
I held the baby. I looked at her tiny fingers and tiny toes.
I was very careful with her. She opened her eyes and looked at me.
I spoke to the baby, but I knew that she could not understand me.
Babies have to learn to walk and talk.
My aunt changed the baby.
Babies wear diapers, so they need to be changed often.
The baby has a lot of toys, but she is still too young to play with them.
My aunt says that it won't be long before the baby is crawling and trying to talk.
Babies are cute. I have seen pictures of myself when I was a baby,
and it's hard to believe that I was once that small.

The minister says words to the couple which will make them man and wife.
The bride and groom smile at each other, but they seem to be a little bit nervous.
They give each other golden rings to wear to symbolize that they are married.
They kiss each other and walk out of the church as the organist plays joyous music.
Some of the people in the church cried at the wedding, but not because they were sad.
Everyone in the church is very happy for the couple.
A photographer takes pictures of the happy couple.
We wish them well and look forward to the reception where we will have dinner,
and we will dance and have a good time until it is very late.

""Your surprise wants to see you,"" my dad said.
He opened the door to the bedroom, and a tiny puppy came running out.
We were all very excited. Our surprise was a puppy.
It was a little baby spaniel.
The puppy loved all of us.
She ran around and licked all of our faces.
We had always wanted a dog.
We take turns feeding the puppy and taking her out for walks.
She is growing quickly and will soon be an adult dog.

I don't mean normal hair colors like brown or black.
My friends have dyed their hair orange, purple and blue.
I told my mother that I would like to dye my hair green.
I explained to my mother that I would only use food coloring.
The green would not last forever.
My mother said that dyeing your hair was a silly fad.
She said that I would not look good with green hair.
I said that if I couldn't dye my hair green, maybe I could get a nose ring.
My mother said ""no"".
I said that maybe a tattoo on my arm would be nice.
My mother said ""no way"".
My mother said that she did some crazy things when she was a young girl.
She said that she used to iron her hair to make it straight.
That sounds quite boring to me.
My friend Joan came over.
Her hair is dyed bright pink.
My father said ""nice hair, Joan"".
I don't think that he really meant it.
My mother says that when I am an adult
I can dye my hair whatever crazy color I like,
but for now she would like me to leave my hair its natural color.
I tried to tell her that all my friends were doing it.
My mother asked, ""if all your friends were jumping off a cliff, would you do it too?""
I said ""no"".
I think I'll have to wait to have green hair, but maybe by the time I'm old enough to dye my hair green,
I won't want it that color.
My mother says that fads change all the time.
One day something might be popular, and the next day it's not in style at all.
I'll just have to live without green hair for now.
I wonder what the fad will be next month.

103,103. The birthday gift,B1,103-the-birthday-gift,30,"It is going to be my father's birthday.
What can I give him?
I don't have much money.
I have looked all through the stores,
and I have not found anything that I think he would like, or that I can afford.
I have thought very hard about what to buy for him.
I thought that he might like some candy, but my father really doesn't eat many sweets.
I thought that he might like a new shirt, but he has lots of clothes.
I can't afford a new car or computer for him.
I was watching him on the weekend.
He cut the grass, washed the car, took out the garbage,
weeded the garden and watered the plants.
I got an idea.
I went to my room and took out some paper.
I cut out pieces of paper, and I wrote on them.
I wrote on one piece of paper that I would wash the car every weekend for the summer.
I wrote on another piece that I would take out the garbage every week for the summer.
I also wrote that I would cut the grass,
weed the garden and water the plants every week for the summer.
I made a birthday card for my dad, and I put the pieces of paper inside it.
I went downstairs and gave my gift to my dad.
My dad thought that the gift was very thoughtful.
He said that it was a gift from the heart.
I did all those things for my dad all summer.
He said that he had a lot of free time because I helped him so much.
My dad and I are good friends.
I don't mind doing things for him because I know that he is always there to help me out.
A good gift doesn't have to be something that costs a lot.
My dad says that the best gifts are the ones that show how much you care for the other person.
I'm glad my dad liked his gift.

Many people make resolutions.
They resolve to be better people.
Some people decide that they will lose weight so that they can be healthier.
Some people decide to give up smoking.
They also want to be healthier.
There are all kinds of resolutions that people make.
Some people try not to lose their tempers.
Some people say that they will work harder.
There are people who try to give up bad habits.
Every year, my brother says that he will stop biting his nails.
He stops biting his nails in January,
but by February he always starts again.
That is the thing about New Year's resolutions.
People seldom keep them.
Everybody starts out with good intentions,
but it is very hard to stick with them.
I don't make New Year's resolutions.
I find that I just break them.
I just work day by day to break my bad habits.
I know that I eat too many sweets.
Every day, I just try to resist them.
I think that every day is a new day regardless of whether it is New Year's Day or not.
Bad habits are hard to break.
The best thing is never to start any bad habits.
I don't know if my brother will ever stop biting his nails,

Just imagine what it would be like to soar into the sky, flying high above the trees.
You could stand on high rooftops and never be afraid of falling.
You would see so many things as you flew over rooftops and forests.
You would feel incredibly free as you traveled from place to place, not bothered by road signs or traffic jams.
If I could fly like a bird, I would start from my backyard and travel through town.
I would look down on the houses and factories.
When I got tired, I would land in a field and take a nap.
I would travel above rivers, and follow them as they wound along and emptied into lakes and oceans.
I would fly above parks, and I would call out to the children as I flew high above them.
I would dip and dive as I flew.
I would soar up high and dive down low so that I could almost touch the treetops.
Have you ever flown?
I know that you can't fly like a bird, but you might have taken an airplane ride.
When you're in an airplane, you pass through clouds.
It is exciting to take an airplane ride.
I love taking airplane flights.
I like to look down at the Earth.
When you're up that high, everything below you looks tiny.
That's the closest I'll get to flying like a bird.
But I can still use my imagination
and spread my wings and soar high above the world just like a bird.

She tells me to save my money for a rainy day.
She says that I should eat my vegetables if I want to be strong when I grow up.
She says that you reap what you sow.
I didn't know what that one meant, so I asked her.
She said that if you are good to people, they will be good to you.
If you do bad things, then bad things will come back to you.
My mother is always giving me advice.
She says that a penny saved is a penny earned.
I am still thinking about that one.
Some of these things are difficult to understand.
My mother is very wise.
She says that she has learned from her mistakes.
She tells me that she would like me not to make mistakes,
but she says that everyone does make mistakes.
The important thing is that we learn from our mistakes.
My mother says that nobody is perfect.
My mother tells my sister that time is precious.
My sister wastes time, and my mother doesn't like that.
My mother tells me to be true to myself.
She says that I should not follow the crowd.
I should listen to my own conscience and do what I think is right.
She says that it doesn't matter if you fail at something, the important thing is that you try.
If you've done your best, then that is all that matters.
I listen to my mother. I think she gives very good advice.
My mother has a lot of common sense.
I hope I am as wise as she is when I have children of my own.
Sometimes I wish that she would not give me so much advice.
I think that I know what I'm doing.
But, in the end, I always remember what she has said,

Take the advice that your parents give you.
They only have your best interests at heart.

My mother will go with me.
The nurses will take my temperature and check my blood pressure.
They will make sure that I am ready for my operation.
I will be dressed in a white gown, and I will be wheeled down the hall to the operating room.
I can't have anything to eat or drink for a long time before my surgery.
My mother will walk down the hall with me;
then she will wave goodbye as they wheel me into the operating room.
The doctor and the nurses will be busy in the operating room.
They will be getting ready to perform my surgery.
The doctor will say hello to me and tell me that he is going to put me to sleep.
He will put something into my arm.
He will tell me to count backwards from ten.
I think that I will only say ""ten, nine"" and then I will be fast asleep.
I won't be awake for the surgery.
When I wake up, I will be surprised that the surgery is over.
My throat will hurt, and I probably won't feel very good.
My mother will be there with me.
The nurses will give me a drink and try to make me comfortable.
I won't be in the hospital overnight.
I will go home later in the day.
My parents will have to make sure that I have a lot to drink.
I can't eat any hard foods or they will hurt my throat.
I will sleep a lot, because I will not feel very well for a couple of days.
It won't take long before I recover from my surgery.

It would be very dangerous, but just think of the things that you could do.
You could live in a dollhouse, or even a shoebox.
You could use a bottle cap for a plate.
You would have to wear dolls' clothes.
A stamp would make a lovely picture to hang on your wall.
You could hide in a mouse hole or a drawer.
You wouldn't need much food.
You could probably live comfortably on the crumbs that people would leave on the table.
A thimble would make a good cup.
If you went outside, the grass would seem like a jungle.
An insect would be huge and frightening.
A puddle would seem to be an ocean.
You could cross the puddle in a paper cup and use a spoon for an oar.
A matchbox would make a good bed with a handkerchief as a bedspread.
You'd brush your hair with a toothbrush,
but you'd never find anything small enough to brush your teeth with.
You could take a ride on the back of a mouse.
You wouldn't find any books that were small enough to read, but
you might read the back of a pill bottle.
You could ride in a toy car and have a soup bowl for a swimming pool.
A leaf could be your umbrella,
and a mitten would make a great sleeping bag.
If you used your imagination, you could think up something to use for almost all your purposes.
Being small might be fun, but then again, it would be frightening.
I'd be afraid of my pet cat.

I couldn't ride in a car or a plane.
I suppose I would just have to take giant steps to get from place to place.
I would have to be very careful not to step on anybody or anything.
When I talked, people would cover their ears.
My voice would sound very loud to them.
I wouldn't find shoes to cover my feet.
I wouldn't find a knife and fork to eat my dinner with.
I might have to use a rake as a fork.
My dinner would be huge.
What would I cook my dinner in?
I certainly wouldn't find an oven big enough to put my dinner in.
If I sneezed, it would be like a hurricane.
If I fell down, it would be like an earthquake.
I wouldn't have any friends because everyone would be too tiny for me to talk to.
I think that being a giant would be very lonely.
I couldn't have just one apple. I would have to have a lot of apples to fill me up.
I would have to drink gallons and gallons of water to quench my thirst.
I could never relax under a tree. I would be taller than all the trees.

110,110. My favorite bedtime story,B1,110-my-favorite-bedtime-story,25,"Every night when I was little, my mother would read me a bedtime story.
My favorite story was Tom's Midnight Garden.
This was a story by Philippa Pearce.
It was quite a long book,
and it took quite a few nights for my mother to read the entire book to me.
In Tom's Midnight Garden Tom moves to the city to stay with his aunt and uncle.
He is very bored at their apartment.
They have no children, so Tom has nothing to do.
One night, the clock strikes thirteen times.
Tom knows that this is impossible.
A clock can only strike up to twelve times.
He sneaks downstairs and goes outside.
When he goes outside, there is a wonderful garden that wasn't there the day before.
The next day, Tom goes outside and finds there is no garden.
The garden only seems to appear at night.
Every night, Tom slips out to this wonderful garden, and meets some people in the garden.
He meets a girl named Hattie.
Hattie and Tom become very good friends in this garden.
Some very strange things happen in this book.
There are some coincidences that keep you guessing about what is really going on.
The surprise ending is wonderful.
I really enjoyed Tom's Midnight Garden
and I was very sad when my mother and I came to the end of the book.
I felt that I had visited the magical garden with Tom.
It is a book that I will remember all my life

Yesterday was Friday the 13th.
Some people think that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day.
I think that it is just like any other day.
Some people believe that if a black cat crosses your path, you will have bad luck.
I don't believe that either.
My mother always gets upset if I open an umbrella in the house.
She says that is bad luck.
She is probably right about that one.
Because an open umbrella would take up a lot of space,
and you might knock things over.
If your left hand is itchy, you are supposed to get money.
I have had an itchy left hand before, but I haven't received any money because of it.
It is bad luck to walk under a ladder.
That is probably true because you might knock somebody off the ladder,
or have a can of paint fall on top of you.
If you are acting in a play, it is bad luck if someone says ""Good luck to you""
This is very confusing.
You are supposed to tell an actor to ""break a leg""
It doesn't mean that you want the actor to break his leg.
It means good luck to the actor.
Actors have a lot of superstitions that are very unusual.
I am not superstitious.
I don't believe in superstitions at all.
It is just fun to learn about superstitions.

I am not used to that kind of dancing.
I always dance to rock music.

It looked very easy.
I held one of his hands, and put my other hand on his shoulder.
He told me exactly how to move my feet.
I was very clumsy, and I stepped on his toes.
He was patient with me, and he counted ""one, two, three"".
I tried to waltz with him.
I would start out pretty well, but then I would get mixed up and stand on his toes again.

He used to tie a towel over his shoulders and run through the backyard.
He pretended that he was rescuing people.
One time he stood on the roof.
He really thought that he could fly with his super hero cape on.
He would have hurt himself if he had jumped.
My dad saw him and told him to get down.
My dad explained to my brother that super heroes are not real.
Real people cannot fly from rooftops.
My brother was disappointed.
He thought that the super heroes really existed.
My dad explained that most super heroes were created as comic book characters.
Somebody used their imagination to make them up, and then an artist drew them.
My brother was not impressed.
He said that he wanted to meet the super heroes.
My father told him that he might meet someone dressed up as a super hero,
but it wouldn't really be a super hero in the costume.
It is hard to explain to small children
that the things that they see in comic books and on television aren't really real.
My brother still pretends that he is a super hero.

They aren't getting divorced because of Mary.
Sometimes, marriages just don't work out.
It isn't really anyone's fault.
Marriage isn't easy.
It is hard for two people to stay together for a lifetime.
Sometimes, people change as they get older, and they move on.
Some people have perfectly good marriages, and they stay together for their entire lives.
Divorce doesn't happen because the parents don't love the children anymore.
A lot of children feel that it is their fault, but it isn't their fault at all.
Children neither cause the divorce, nor can they prevent it.
It is up to the parents.
Divorce isn't the end of the world.
Children can still see both parents and stay with them.
Life goes on.
Sometimes children can get new stepmothers or stepfathers.
That can be a good thing.
You just have to be understanding, and know that your parents still love you.
Life doesn't always go the way that we planned it, but it has its twists and turns.

I think he would say: ""Hey, I'm bored in this little bowl.
Why don't you get me a bigger tank with more fish in it?
I would like to have some friends to swim around with"".
I went out and bought a bigger tank for my goldfish.
I put some plants at the bottom of the tank,

""This is a nice tank.
It's roomy in here, and you decorated it well,

These are nice goldfish that you brought home for me; thank you"".
Goldfish can't really talk. I know that.

It is fascinating to watch him point to different areas of the country on the map.
He tells us where the weather will be nice and where it will be bad.
The weatherman is not always right.
Weather reporting is not an exact science.
Nothing is very exact when it comes to the weather.
The weather department does a lot of research, but they can never be sure of exactly what will happen.
Sometimes, it looks like it will be clear,
but the wind changes direction and clouds move in.
The weatherman can warn people if there is a chance of a hurricane or tornado.
The weatherman can also warn people of floods.
Sometimes, entire towns have to be evacuated because of bad weather.
It is important to be aware of the weather.
For example, it is not good to be caught in the middle of a field when there is going to be a thunderstorm.
You might want to take extra precautions if there is going to be a heavy snowstorm.
You would need to be in a secure place if a hurricane or tornado was predicted.
You might want to cancel a picnic if you knew that it would rain that day.
The weather affects us in so many ways.
Some people are really affected by dull, cloudy days.
If there are no sunny days, they become very depressed.
Heavy air pressure can cause some people to have headaches.
Weather affects all of us in one way or another.
It is always a topic of conversation.
People often say things like ""hello, it's a beautiful day today"".
Often we plan our lives and activities around the weather.
So, if you are planning on walking home tonight,
keep an eye on the sky.
Are those rain clouds up there? You might need an umbrella.

Most of my friends catch quite a few colds.
They cough, sniffle and sneeze.
They carry around tissues and blow their noses all the time.
Their eyes water, and they have scratchy throats.
I don't get many colds. In fact, I can go for a whole year and never catch a cold.
This is why I consider myself an expert on how not to catch a cold.
I'll tell you how to avoid catching a cold.
I think that you need to take a lot of vitamin C.
I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. I drink fruit juice too.
I also take vitamin C pills.
Whenever I begin to feel a cold coming on,
I make sure that I have taken my vitamin C pill, and I drink a lot of orange juice.
That usually knocks the cold right out of my system.
I make sure that I get a lot of fresh air.
In the winter, a lot of buildings are shut up tight so that the air is stale,
and people's germs circulate through the buildings.
I get outside and breathe in fresh clean air.
If somebody is rude enough to cough or sneeze right in front of me without covering his or her mouth,
I just hold my breath for a second.
I'm not sure if this works or not, but I don't want to breathe in anybody's cold germs.
Many germs are passed through hands.
It is important to wash your hands thoroughly if you touch anything in a public place.
If I hold a banister while I'm walking down the stairs,
I think of all the people who have used that banister,
and I make sure that I wash my hands before I eat.
Doorknobs also have a lot of germs on them.
Money is another thing that is passed from hand to hand and is covered with germs.
Sometimes, I see people stick money into their mouths.
Just think of all the germs that you would be putting into your mouth if you did that.
If you just give it a little bit of thought, you can avoid a lot of germs that cause colds.
If you eat good food and stay fit, your body will be able to fight off the germs that cause colds and other diseases.
It is not always possible to avoid colds, but if you do catch a cold,
drink plenty of fluids and get a lot of rest.

118,118. The future,B1,118-the-future,28,"I sometimes wonder what life will be like in the future.
Life has changed so much in just the past few years.
I'm sure that there are still big changes that are coming.
Do you think we'll still drive cars?
Maybe we'll get into computerized vehicles that we won't have to drive.
We'll just push a few buttons, and the vehicles will take us to wherever we have to go.
Maybe there won't be roads.
We might just fly through space to get where we want to go.
Instead of telephones, we'll just use our computers.
We'll be able to see each other when we talk.
That type of thing is already happening.
Maybe we won't have to cook our meals.
We might be able to push buttons to order whatever we want.
A nice roast beef dinner, or an ice cream sundae, might just pop out of a machine.
It would be nice to have a robot to clean the house for you.
In the past few years, computers have been extremely important.
People used to write to each other through the mail.
Now, people communicate so much more frequently through E-mail.
Most of my friends own computers.
If we had all of these things to do the work for us, what would we do?
We would still need people to program the computers.
We could spend more time being creative, rather than doing everyday chores.
The future holds many surprises.
I'm sure that technology will become even more and more amazing.
When my parents were young, they had never even seen a color television.
Nobody owned a computer.
It doesn't take long for things to change a lot.
Who knows what amazing things are in store for us?

119,119. Giving a speech,B1,119-giving-a-speech,34,"I had to give a speech last week.
I gave a speech to 300 people.
I had to speak in front of a group of students.
I had to tell them about a campaign that we were having to raise money for cancer research.
Giving a speech can be a difficult thing.
When you stand in front of a big crowd, you can get very nervous.
Some people feel like they have weak knees.
Their legs feel as if they are made of rubber.
Their heart beats very hard inside of their chest.
Their palms get sweaty.
Some people even become short of breath.
For some people, giving a speech is their worst fear.
When you give a speech, everyone is looking at you.
They're waiting to hear what you have to say.
When you have 300 people looking at you; you have 600 eyes that are on you.
It is a little frightening when you think of it that way.
Before I give a speech, I take three big breaths.
I calm myself, and I remind myself that what I have to say is important.
I like to be sure of what I am going to say, so I practice my speech in front of a mirror at home.
I like to look like I am relaxed and friendly.
They say that practice makes perfect;
so the more speeches that you give, the better you will become at it.
Whenever I have to give a speech, I imagine that the audience is just one big person.
I look out into the audience until I find a friendly, smiling face.
I focus on that person,
and I pretend that I am just talking to them.
I have become used to giving speeches.
I am more relaxed now than I used to be.
People tell me that I do not look nervous at all.
I like to hear that.
Sometimes I do feel a little flutter of nervousness,
but I just ignore it and do the best that I can.
Giving a speech is not as scary as it appears to be.
Anyone can do it with a little practice.

120,120. Moving to another country,B1,120-moving-to-another-country,31,"My friend Steve moved to another country.
He had lived in Canada all his life, and he moved to Japan.
Life in Japan was very different for Steve than what he was used to.
At first, Steve suffered from culture shock.
His whole life seemed different.
He was not used to the way of life in Japan.
Steve was not used to the large crowds of people that walked up and down the streets in Japan.
In his hometown in Canada, the streets were fairly quiet.
Steve had to get used to the food.
In Japan, the people eat a lot of fish.
Steve had never eaten much fish before.
Steve wanted pizza, but it was expensive in Japan.
Steve said that he had to adjust his eating habits.
The people in Japan have different customs than we do here in Canada.
Steve didn't want to offend anyone, so he had to learn the customs.
He had to learn about what Japanese people considered polite and rude.
Sometimes, in a foreign country you can do something to insult someone
without even realizing that you are being rude.
At first, Steve had trouble with the language.
He said that the only way to really learn the language is to talk to people.
Steve talked to a lot of people.
He made a lot of mistakes, but people were patient with him,
and they tried to help him with his Japanese.
It wasn't long before Steve felt more comfortable in his new surroundings.
You have to be willing to learn new customs and a new language if you move to another country.
Steve feels very comfortable in Japan, and in Canada now.
He is thinking about going to another country now.
He thinks that he might like to try and live in Italy.
I'm sure that he would get over his culture shock very fast if he moved there.
Moving to a new country can be difficult,
but if you are willing to learn, it can be a very rewarding experience.

121,121. My doll,B1,121-my-doll,32,"When I was an infant, I got a rag doll.
It was a very plain, little doll, and it wore a clown outfit and a clown's hat.
I used to take that doll to bed with me every night.
I couldn't go to bed without my doll.
My mother used to pretend that the doll was talking to me.
She would make the doll dance and sing songs.
I would talk to the doll.
My mother would answer for the doll, but I was a baby,
and I thought that the doll was actually talking to me.
That doll was my best friend.
I took her everywhere.
One time I took her to a store with me, and I left her on a shelf in the store.
We were halfway home when I realized that I didn't have my doll with me.
I was very upset.
My mother and I rushed back to the store.
My doll was still there. I was so relieved.
I hugged my doll, and I promised myself that I would never leave her anywhere again.
I couldn't imagine life without that doll.
Through the years, the doll became less important in my life.
I had other things to do, but the doll still sat on my bed during the day,
and I still took it to bed at night.
I gave that doll a lot of love when I was little.
In fact, I loved that doll so much that she looks tattered and torn now.
There are parts of her face and hands that are almost worn away.
I had a lot of other toys when I was little,
but none of them were ever so important as that doll.
I don't play with toys anymore,
but that doll is still in my room.
She sits in a special chair in the corner.
I'll always have that doll.
No matter how worn out she is,
I'll always keep her and cherish her as part of my early childhood.

122,122. I am curious,A2,122-i-am-curious,29,"I am curious about many things.
I would like to find the answers to a lot of questions that I have.
What holds the stars up in the sky?
Why does ice form on the top of the lake when it is cold?
Is there life on other planets?
Why do we not fall off the face of the earth?
How do caterpillars turn into butterflies?
All of these things are mysteries to me.
There are so many questions that are unanswered.
I think I should go to the library and get a book to find out why people grow old.
What makes a television work?
I also want to know where electricity comes from.
Who is the strongest person in the world?
Who is the smartest person in the world?
Why do some people have blonde hair, and some people have black hair?
Why do people in different countries speak different languages?
Why do people have to die?
Why are no two snowflakes alike?
What makes people fall in love?
What makes the rivers run?
Why does the sun rise every morning?
How did the oceans form?
Why did the dinosaurs vanish from the earth?
I wonder if I'll ever find out the answers to all of my questions.
I think I'll have to study hard and stay in school to find out everything that I want to know.
Some questions never get answered.
It is good to be curious.
People who are curious about things are the ones who learn a lot,
and some curious people go on to invent things and make important discoveries.

123,123. Creative people,B2,123-creative-people,33,"Some people are just born to create. That's what I think.
Some people just have the need to write stories,
compose beautiful music, or paint pictures.
Creativity seems to be inside them, and they need to let it out.
It's good that we have people like that.
Composers like Mozart and Chopin have given us music that is incredibly beautiful.
It's not just the classical composers who have given us great pieces of music;
there are modern composers who have written great songs also.
Elton John is an example of someone who has composed many wonderful songs.
Andrew Lloyd Webber has given us some very popular musicals like Cats and The Phantom of the Opera.
There are so many talented and creative people in this world.
When you visit an art gallery,
you marvel at how artists are able to recreate realism
or make up something that seems totally unreal yet beautiful.
The American artist Norman Rockwell painted some pictures that actually look like photographs.
He tried to portray life as it was in America.
Through his paintings, one can get a good sense of American life through the years.
On the other hand, artists like Jackson Pollock did not portray realism.
Jackson Pollock painted abstract pictures.
His paintings are just as good as Norman Rockwell's,
but they are entirely different.
Some books that we read are classics.
Mark Twain portrayed American life through his characters Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.
Charles Dickens brought Victorian England to life through his books.
Most people are familiar with his Christmas Carol
where the mean and miserable Scrooge learns the true meaning of Christmas.
People don't have to read the classics.
There are modern writers who entertain readers through their stories.
Stephen King has written a number of horror stories.
Some of his books have even been made into movies.
We are lucky to have creative people who share their gifts with us.
If you are lucky enough to be creative,
you should use your talents to create works of art that we can all share.

I went to a place where they made me read words and letters on a chart.
Some of the words were big,
and some were very small.
I tried to read everything,

The optometrist would cover one of my eyes while I read the chart.
Then, she would cover my other eye.

I called my friend on the phone, and we talked for a while.

In my yard there is a lawn and a garden.
There is also a sidewalk that leads to my front door,
and a driveway that leads to my garage.
Throughout the year I work to maintain my yard.
During the summer, I cut the grass
that grows in my yard, using a lawn-mower.
I like the smell of the grass when it has just been cut.
But it's better not to cut the grass too short.
When the weather is dry,
I also put water on the lawn and garden,
so that the grass and flowers can grow.
During the autumn,
many leaves fall from the trees in my yard.
I use a rake to collect the leaves from the lawn.
Then I can put the leaves into bags.
I can use the leaves to make fertilizer.
When I was a kid, I didn't like the job of raking leaves,
but now I don't mind it.
Another job during the autumn is to remove flowers
from the garden before cold weather arrives.
During the winter, there is no work to do in the lawn
or garden, because they are covered in snow.
But I need to keep the snow off my sidewalk and driveway.
Whenever it snows, I use a shovel to clear the snow from the sidewalk and the driveway.
Sometimes it snows a lot.
If I didn't shovel the snow,
it would soon be impossible to get into my house!
During the spring, the snow melts.
I clean up my yard by sweeping away the dirt
and by removing weeds from the lawn and garden.
I also put flowers back into the garden.
It's nice to see them again after the long, cold winter.
When spring comes, the grass grows very quickly,
so I need to cut the grass quite often.
Working in the yard can be very satisfying work.

up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky,
twinkle, twinkle little star"".
This is a little poem (song) I always say when I'm outside, and I see the stars.
When I see the first star of the night, I always say this one:
""Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight;
I wish I may; I wish I might,
have the wish I wish tonight"".
Do you have a special thing to say about the stars?
Stars are beautiful bright spots in the sky.
Stars are usually seen at night when it is dark.
We can't see them in the day time because the sun is so bright, the brightest star of all.
I like staying up late just to look at the stars.
One time I was outside at midnight,
and the stars seemed to sparkle and dance.
They really did look like diamonds dancing in the sky!
If you watch the stars long enough, you may see a falling star or a shooting star.
I have seen both.
A falling star is where the star just seems to drop,
and it leaves a trail of what appears like star dust.
A shooting star is very beautiful.
It ""shoots"" across the sky leaving a long trail of colorful ""star dust"".
Shooting stars seem to brighten up the whole sky.
They usually seem quite close to earth.
Have you ever watched the stars and got the urge to reach out and touch them,
or even join them in their secret dance?
I wonder what it'd be like to see a star up close.
Would it look like the moon?

I will go up in a rocket ship and visit the dancing stars in the midnight sky!

133,133. Music,B1,133-music,30,"A song comes on the radio. My lips start to move, singing along.
My fingers start to snap; my feet begin to tap.
The music sinks deep into my soul.
I listen to the music as it fills my brain, and I remember when I used to sing.
I sang in front of huge crowds.
I loved it when they watched me and clapped for me when I was finished.
Letting out my feelings when I was sad, mad, happy, or glad was when I would sing.
I sang in the shower; I sang in the rain;
I sang in church; I sang walking down the street!
Music has always been a big part of my life.
It seems like I was a baby when I started playing the piano!
I would sit on my sister's lap while she played the piano, and I would bang on the keys.
I remember sitting beside her and learning how to sing.
I sang my little lungs out!
As I grew, I listened to other singers on tapes, the radio and C.D.s.
I took those things that I had heard from different singers and made myself sound like them.
Soon, I could take what I had heard all my life and make it into my own sound.
I have always liked singing jazz and blues.
I don't listen to jazz and blues a lot, however.
I listen to pop, rock, classical and some country.
As you can see, I like many types of music.
I have seen musicals, too,
like Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables.
Those musicals were amazing.
There were such bright costumes and stage sets,
not to mention the wonderful songs and singing.
Music has been on this earth since the beginning of time,
and it touches everyone in a different way.
I know it does not only touch mine
but is a big part of my very being.

My mother answers it.
""Hello,"" she says. It is for me.
When I pick up the phone, I hear a boy's voice.
It is a boy I go to school with.
This boy is very nice, and he is cute, too.
He asks me if I want to go out for dinner with him tonight.
I say yes.
He's going to pick me up at 5:30 p.m. in the evening.
He has a nice red car.
Before he picks me up, I have to find an outfit to wear.
I am nervous and don't know what to wear.
So my sister picks out an outfit for me.
I feel excited and have the sensation of butterflies in my stomach.
The inside of my hands are damp, too.
I put on my outfit and do my hair.
My sister gives me some nice clips to put in my hair.
""Ding dong,"" the doorbell buzzes.
My date is here!
I hurry to the door, so I can greet him.
He tells me that I look nice
and that we are going to a place called M-T Bellies.
When we arrive at M-T Bellies,
there is loud music playing.
A smiling waitress comes who serves us our food.
I order a large caesar salad.
My date orders steak.
When it arrives, the food looks and is delicious!
The waitress asks us if we want dessert after we've finished.
But we are too full.
So we ask for our bill to pay.
My date pays for the meal.
I brought money just in case we would share the cost.
When we leave the restaurant, we go for a walk by the river.
It is a beautiful night.
I am enjoying my first date.
I am laughing and having fun.
It is time for us to go home.
So my date takes me home.
I smile and thank him for the great time.
I hope he'll ask me out again!

135,135. University,B1,135-university,36,"It's time to sign up for school.
This year Natalie is going to Brock University.
She has never been to university before.
She is a little bit scared.
She hopes she meets nice, new friends.
Natalie stood in line to get her picture taken.
The picture was put on a card.
The card was her picture ID (identification).
She would use this card if she needed to buy books from the school bookstore;
if she wanted to get a book from the library;
or if she wanted to use the pool!
After all of the signing up and money was paid,
Natalie went out to lunch with her mother.
""Mom, I'm kind of scared about going to school.
I'm going to be the youngest kid there.
I don't know how to take notes.
The teachers might be mean...."",
Natalie rambled on.
Her mom just calmed her down and said,
""Take one day at a time, Natalie.
Worry only about today"".
""Hmmm. You're right, Mom. Thanks!""
Natalie was very scared on the first day of school.
She made sure she had all of the books she needed
and lots of pens, pencils and erasers.
She walked into the front of the building
and went on her way to try and find her classroom.
Natalie got through her classes and met a lot of new people, nice people.
Her classes seemed to go by really fast,
and the day went by even faster.
When Natalie got home she was so excited.
She told her mom that classes weren't all that scary;
the students and the teachers weren't scary either!
Natalie knew that the school work would be hard,
but she felt good about the people she had met that day.
She knew she'd have a good year.

136,136. School dance,B1,136-school-dance,33,"It is the first school dance that I have ever been to.
All of the boys are standing on one side of the gymnasium,
and all of the girls are on the other side.
There is loud music playing,
and I can hardly hear my friends talking.
The music is going fast,
and some people are starting to move to the beat of the song.
Soon all the girls are dancing,
but the boys are still standing against the wall.
Then the song ends, and slow music comes on.
I don't know what to do, so I just go and stand against the wall.
Then one of the boys in my class comes over
and asks me if I would like to dance to the slow song.
I really feel awkward and nervous, but say yes.
We go out into the middle of the gym,
and he puts his hands on my waist,
and I put my hands on his shoulders.
We start to move to the music, and we step on each other's feet!
He is bigger than me, so my toe starts to hurt a little bit!
As we continue to ""slow dance"",
more boys and girls come to the middle of the gym to dance together.
It sure is funny to watch people dance
because they are stepping on each other's toes and bumping into each other
and turning in opposite directions!
Soon the song ends, and the boys go to one side of the gym again.
The girls decide that they want to dance to a fast song,
so they stay in the middle of the gym and dance with one another.
Our teachers are making sure that we are behaving because they are watching us.
I wonder if they want to dance.
They probably are remembering their first school dance.
I wonder if someday I'll be grown up just like the teachers
and laughing at the memories of my first school dance?
I sure hope so!

137,137. Health,B1,137-health,28,"Our health is very important to us.
People can have good jobs, money or good looks.
However, if they become sick, those things don't mean a thing.
It is wonderful to feel good.
Feeling good isn't just about our body.
It is also about our mind and spirit.
We need to feel good in every area of our life.
One of the things we can do to be healthy is to get enough sleep.
If we don't sleep well, or enough, it hurts our body.
It is during sleep that our body restores itself.
Everybody knows we should also eat good foods.
We need milk products, meats, fruits
and vegetables and breads and cereals.
We shouldn't eat too much fat or sugar things either.
Of course, we just shouldn't eat too much at all!
Another thing that is very important is water.
Exercise is very good for both our body and mind.
It is good for our heart, lungs, muscles and bones.
It gets oxygen to our brain to help us think better.
It can help us be smarter!
Doing things that we believe are right and good gives us peace inside.
It makes us nicer people and is good for our spirit.
When we do what we know is right,
it helps to reduce stress, which isn't good for any part of us.
When we take care of our body, mind, and spirit,
we feel good all over and inside, too!
What a beautiful world this would be
if we could all work at doing these things for ourselves and also trying to be a help to others!

So many of these ""things"" are walking down my street.
""Oh, no! They are coming to my door!""
The doorbell chimes, and I slowly open the door.
There standing on my front porch, is a little ghost and a cute little witch.
They hold up a bag and say, ""trick or treat"".
I put candy into their bags and they smile and say, ""Thank you"".
Every October 31st is Halloween.
That is when children dress up as different things
(not just funny people, but things like animals or fruits or vegetables...).
They go from door to door and get different candies or little toys from the people in the houses.
Some children, who are not very nice,
will do naughty things to houses where people are not home, like throwing eggs at their windows.
I think that is bad.
Sometimes people decorate their houses for this day.
Some of the houses can be pretty scary.
They'll have scary noises coming from a tape recorder, too.
However, it's only for a few days out of the year,
so we may as well have fun with it.
This year my brother is dressing up as a skeleton,
and I'm dressing up as a bride.
I am wearing my mom's wedding dress.
It is fun dressing up in costumes and putting on lots of makeup.
Sometimes our friends don't even know who we really are!
The best part of Halloween is the candy, of course.
I once got an entire garbage bag full of candy.
My mom and dad took it away because I was eating too much.
Mom gave me a piece of candy every day, though.
If you eat too much candy, you can get a stomach ache.
You need to remember to brush your teeth often, too, so you don't get cavities.
Still, that candy sure does taste good!
Well, it's time to go ""trick or treating"".
So off I go, door to door, getting yummy candy and hearing people say,
""Oh, aren't you pretty!""

139,139. New Year's,B1,139-new-years,33,"""Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! HAPPY NEW YEAR!""
What is New Year's? Well, to me a New Year is when the date of the year changes.
This year it is 2001,
and on December 31st at midnight it will change to 2002.
I wonder who invented the changing of the years
and how it was made the way it is.
It must have been someone a long time ago, since it's already 2001.
When New Year's comes closer, a lot of people talk about New Year's resolutions.
I don't bother making ""resolutions"" because I never do them anyway!
And the ones I do make are usually ones that will happen anyway.
I guess it's just common sense.
The biggest reason why I like New Year's
is because of the fireworks that we have here in Canada
and many other countries, too.
You should see some of the fireworks that go off.
There are many different colors.
There's pink, blue, purple, yellow, green, red, even white, silver and gold.
Fireworks make loud bangs, squeals, siren sounds, and sometimes all at once.
There are lots of different sounds, but I can't even explain what they are all like.
Fireworks are best when it's very dark outside.
They light up the whole sky!
Sometimes, they look as though they are going to fall on you.
I like New Year's because it's fun in other ways,
but the fireworks are the best.
You can buy fireworks to use for your own fireworks show.
However, you have to be careful that no one gets burned or hurt.
Usually, there are parties at New Year's.
Some people really dress up fancy and even wear masks.
They don't know who one another is until midnight when they take their masks off.
As midnight comes very close, everybody begins to count down,
and then everyone yells out ""Happy New Year's""
and bang pots and pans or ring bells or honk horns.
Join me in the count down on New Year's Eve!

140,140. More music,B1,140-more-music,34,"I like music. I have always liked music.
Even when I was very young, I liked music.
I like to listen to it, and to make it.
When I was a little girl, listening to nice music would sometimes make me cry!
That may seem silly, but the music was so pretty that I cried!
As I grew older, I started to take piano lessons.
I was not very good at first, but after a while I got better.
Also, as I grew older, I started to take violin lessons.
I did not sound very good at all at first, but I improved.
When I was a teenager in high school, I made sure I had music classes every year.
Those were the classes I enjoyed most of all.
Everyone loved music, and we had a lot of fun.
I started to take private singing lessons while I was in high school, too.
I also sang in the choir, played in a band and acted in plays in high school.
The plays were all musicals, so I got to sing and dance and enjoy music that way also.
It was so much fun pretending to be other people!
When I finished high school, I went to university to learn how to be a music teacher.
That was a lot of fun because every day I was with other people who loved music as much as I do.
Mostly I played the piano,
but I also learned how to play the drums, a saxophone, a trombone,
a French horn, a clarinet, a flute, which I really was not very good at, and a viola.
I took more singing lessons, too.
We did not have plays to sing and act in, but I sang in the university choir.
Some years, I played the piano for other students who were learning other instruments.
One year, I played duets with another girl who was also there to play piano.
She and I made sure we played fast, funny songs, so we really enjoyed ourselves doing it.
Now, I am a music teacher. I do not have a lot of students,
not as many as I used to have anyway. I still find it very rewarding.
I like to see people who start off not knowing very much, if anything,
and go on to be very good at creating music.
I still love listening to music also.
Music makes me happy when I am sad.
It makes me want to dance or sing when I'm already happy.
Mostly, music just makes me glad that I am me and that music is alive in me.

Her soft cheek rests against my chest,
while her sweet breath puffs gently on my skin.
Her tiny lips are puckered a bit.
Her little eyelids flutter.
I wonder what she dreams about as she sleeps.
Does she dream?
I have heard her whimper in her sleep.
Sometimes she awakens with a scream.
What is so scary in her little baby dreams?
Once I heard her giggle as she slept.
Her dreams must have been sweet that day.
I have had three babies.
The one I am holding now is my last one.
My other babies are grown up more and now at school.
I love their childish play and laughter.
I miss their baby dimples and their baby sounds and smells.
There is such joy in the birth of a new baby.
We hear their first little cry,
telling us all is well with their small world.
We feel their newborn skin, wrinkled, soft and slightly damp.
We feel each little limb and are filled with wonder and humility.
Life is good as baby takes its first food from its mother.
Family gathers around, each waiting to hold and love this newest member.
Each time the baby cries, its mom worries, and their bond becomes stronger.
Babies have their own special smell.
Some have described it as ""milk and innocence"".
It is the sweetest smell on earth, I think.
It cannot be copied.
Somehow, it disappears as baby grows.
I love to hear my baby talk.
Once in a while I can even understand a little bit!
She is so serious in her baby talk that I just have to pick her up and hug her.
I love to hear her say ""Mommy"".
When my baby is tickled, or when the dog or her big brothers do something funny,
it is so sweet to hear her baby laugh.
It's such a cute little giggle!
Sometimes she laughs so hard,
her face turns red, tears come to her eyes,
and she falls down weak with the laughter.
Those who watch her can't help but laugh, too.
I hope she always laughs so easily.
The parents watch with pride and joy as baby grows and has many ""firsts"".
There is the first time baby sleeps through the night,
rolls over, smiles, laughs, hugs and kisses.
Then there is the first tooth, crawling, first step and first word.
With each new first, the baby becomes less a baby!
These steps are a little sad to parents, too,
because they know they're ""losing their baby"".
However, to a mother, even an adult child is still her baby!
My baby is not perfect.
Sometimes she gets mad or whines for no reason.
But, to me, she is still beautiful.
Her smiles more than make up for her tears.
Her hugs wipe away when she's been bad.
I intend to cherish each moment with my baby while I can!

I picked her up at the airport in Toronto
and drove her through the traffic and multilane highways,
past the grape vines and peach trees to Niagara Falls, where I live.
She was very tired from the flight and soon slept.
The first day we walked to see the Falls.
The spray from the Falls drifts high into the air and across the people standing to watch.
There are people from all over the world watching the water and using their cameras.
Because it was April there was still ice beside the water,
huge chunks of ice that looked like white rocks.
In the river there were floating pieces of ice moving downstream.
The next day we went to the town where the Niagara River joins Lake Ontario.
The weather was warm.
We walked a long way and our feet were hot,
so we went down to the edge of the water to put our feet in.
One toe in was enough!
The water was so cold it made our feet ache!
A piece of ice drifted beside our feet.
I put one foot in for a second then out,
as the pain of the cold went right through me!
My sister could not understand how it could be so warm, but there was still ice.
Another day we went to see my daughter;
she is living on a farm an hour's drive away.
We walked through her trees;
the buds were starting to turn into leaves.
We stopped and looked at the spring wildflowers.
We climbed across a creek by walking over a fallen tree.
We saw the footprints of raccoons by the water.
There was fresh air and sunshine and blue sky.
On the way home we stopped for hamburgers and fries at a drive-through restaurant.
She had never been to a drive-through restaurant before.
Then we went to a donut shop.
There are no donut shops where she lives.
There was a choice of 20 different types of donuts:
some round, some with holes, some with frosting,
some with jam inside, each was different.
The days passed quickly,
and soon it was time to take her back to the airport.
Some of the trees now had leaves;
some of the tulips were now blooming.
It was hard to say goodbye to my sister.

the sky was blue with a few white clouds.
It was a good day to pick strawberries;
it was a good day to go to the beach.
I drove to a pick-your-own farm where people can pick their own fruit and buy it.
There the fruit is very fresh and delicious.
The owner of the farm gave everyone a row to pick their strawberries.
Everyone was wearing sun hats.
I knelt down on the straw between the rows
and picked the big juicy red berries.
I tasted one; it was warm from the sun.
When I bit into it the juice was sweet and strong.
When three big pails were full, I went to pay for them
and picked up some recipes for some strawberry desserts.
I packed two of the pails in a cooler with some ice,
and the other one we would eat at the beach.
I met my daughter at the beach.
She had a soft pink blanket on the sand.
This beach is beside a lake,
and across the lake about 50 kilometers away
the large city can sometimes be seen.
Today the wind blew cooler air across the lake over the people on the beach.
There were children playing in the water.
One man helped his son dig holes in the sand,
and the water ran into the holes.
One lady held her children's hands and walked down into the water.
Families climbed over the rocks
and sat on the last rock where the water was deep.
Teenagers rode bicycles and roller blades along the path beside the beach.
Adults walked and ran along this path,
carrying water bottles around their waists.
We sat on the blanket and ate sandwiches of meat and lettuce and strawberries from the pail.
We talked and read books and lay in the sun, relaxing.
We wore sunscreen, but our skin was getting hot.
How cold was the water?
We walked across the sand that almost burned our feet, to the edge of the water.
She went right in and lay down floating.
I put my toes in and felt the chill through my body.
I went up to my knees, then my thighs, but that was far enough!
My whole body was cooled down;
I headed back to the blanket to lay in the sun again.
Soon it was time to go home,
she was coming to my house for supper.
We drove down the highway with the windows open
and our hair blowing in the warm breeze.
We cut the strawberries up and made a strawberry dessert with cake and ice cream.
We sat outside in the backyard under the maple trees
with the birds singing around us and ate our supper.
It was a perfect ending to a relaxing summer day.

144,144. The planets of our Solar System,B1,144-the-planets-of-our-solar-system,43,"The planet on which we live is called the Earth.
Our planet is constantly moving around the sun,
and each year, the Earth travels all the way around the sun.
But there are many other planets that also travel around the sun.
Together with the sun, the planets, and various other bodies,
the Earth is part of our ""solar system"".
The planet that is closest to the sun is Mercury.
Mercury is extremely hot, and it is much smaller than the Earth.
The second planet from the sun is Venus.
Venus is about the same size as the Earth.
Venus is also very hot.
The Earth is the third planet from the sun.
The Earth is unusual among the planets, because it has such a large moon.
The Earth is bigger than the moon, but the moon is still quite large.
It takes about one month for the moon to travel around the Earth.
The fourth planet from the sun is Mars.
Mars is known for its red color.
Mars is smaller and colder than the Earth.
Mars has two very small moons.
After the planet Mars, there are many small bodies called the asteroids.
These rocky objects are much smaller than the planets.
The first four planets are all made of rock and metal.
The remaining planets, however, are mostly made of frozen gases.
The fifth planet is called Jupiter.
Jupiter is the largest planet.
It has many moons that travel around it,
and it also has a large red spot.
The sixth planet is called Saturn.
Saturn is the second-largest planet, and it is famous for the wide ""rings"" that surround it.
These rings are made up of many smaller objects that are found in the same area.
The seventh planet is called Uranus.
The eighth planet is called Neptune.
These planets are also gas giants, but they are smaller than Jupiter and Saturn.
Both Uranus and Neptune are so far from the sun
that scientists only discovered these planets during the past few hundred years, using telescopes.
The other planets had all been visible to curious people for many thousands of years.
The ninth planet is called Pluto.
Pluto is very small, and it is much more rocky than the gas giants.
Some scientists believe that Pluto is not really a planet at all.
They suggest that Pluto is the largest of many asteroids that are found at the edge of the solar system.
The solar system is a vast place.
So far, people have not travelled beyond the moon.
But perhaps someday, human astronauts will visit the other planets of our solar system!

145,145. Learning to drive,B1,145-learning-to-drive,33,"Each year, many young people learn to drive a car.
For many people, learning to drive is important
because the car is an important method of transportation in many places.
Before learning to drive a car,
it is important to understand the rules of the road.
A beginning driver should already understand the many signs that are found along the roads.
Also, the student driver should know the many rules about changing lanes,
turning, stopping, and many other aspects of driving.
In addition, the driver should be familiar with the way the car is operated;
it is important to know how to use the lights,
signals, brakes, accelerator, and steering wheel.
When a person starts learning to drive, it may take some time to become skillful.
It takes some practice to become an expert in driving a car.
One must become familiar with steering, speeding up, and slowing down.
At first, it is good to practice driving in a large open space,
such as an empty parking lot.
Here, one can practice without being a danger to anyone.
When a person gains some skill in driving,
it is then safe enough to practice driving on a road.
Of course, a student driver must still be very careful.
He or she should always have an expert driver in the car with him or her.
Many beginning drivers take driving lessons from professional instructors,
who can teach safe driving techniques.
Eventually, the young driver is ready for a driving test,
which is needed to obtain a regular driver's licence.
This test is supervised by a government official.
In the driving test, the driver must show that he or she
can control the car with great skill
by being able to make turns and to park the car in small spaces.
But he or she must also show respect for the rules of the road by driving at a proper speed,
and obeying all traffic signs and signals.
Of course, even when one has obtained a driver's licence,
it is always important to drive carefully and responsibly!

146,146. Snow,B1,146-snow,30,"Snow is the white substance that falls to the ground during cold weather conditions.
Each tiny piece of snow, called a snowflake,
is a very small amount of water that has frozen into an unusual shape.
During the winter months, huge numbers of snowflakes fall to the ground,
covering the land in a white blanket of snow.
In many parts of the world, people never see any snow.
Snow only falls when there is moisture in the air,
and when the temperature falls below the freezing point of water,
which is zero degrees Celsius.
During the winter, snow falls instead of rain.
One advantage of snow is that it allows many fun outdoor activities.
Children like to play in the snow.
For example, they may make a ""snowman"" by rolling snow into a large ball,
and then placing these balls of snow on top of each other, in the shape of a person.
Another fun activity in the snow is skiing.
Skis are very long, thin, flat pieces of hard material that one wears on one's feet.
Wearing skis allows a person to slide along the surface of the snow.
People can ski down the side of a hill, travelling at great speeds.
Many people find the sport of downhill skiing to be very exciting.
Some people like to ski along flat ground, often travelling great distances.
This sport, called cross-country skiing, is an excellent way to develop physical fitness.
Of course, snow also causes some problems.
Snow can make driving dangerous because falling snow makes roads slippery,
and on a windy day, blowing snow can make it difficult to see very far.
It can also be a lot of work to remove snow from the roads and sidewalks.
Snow is a heavy substance, and it must be cleared away using a shovel or a large machine.
Many people love the beauty of the land when it is covered by snow.
The white covering of snow over the fields and trees can give a feeling of peace and calm.
If you have never seen snow before,
you should someday experience this strange and wonderful substance!

147,147. Christmas,B1,147-christmas,31,"In most Western countries, Christmas is the biggest holiday of the year.
People gather with their families to celebrate this day,
which occurs on December 25th each year.
The holiday of Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ.
In the Christian religion, Jesus Christ is recognized as the Son of God.
During the Christmas season, many people celebrate the events of the birth of Jesus Christ.
For example, they recall the three wise men
who visited Jesus Christ shortly after his birth.
Also, they recall that Jesus Christ was born in a manger,
because his parents could not find a place to stay.
In Western countries, Christmas is also celebrated by many people who are not religious.
People view Christmas as a time for being together with one's relatives.
Children, parents, and grandparents gather to exchange presents
and to eat special foods.
The tradition of giving gifts at Christmas is unusual in one way.
When children go to bed on the evening before Christmas,
they hang large socks (called stockings) in their house.
When they wake up on Christmas morning, the stockings have been filled with toys and candy.
According to tradition, the presents have been given by a fat man
who wears a white beard and a red suit.
This man, called Santa Claus, flies around the world in a sled that is pulled by reindeer.
He stops at each house and flies down the chimney to deliver his presents.
In the weeks before Christmas, children are usually very well behaved.
Their parents tell them that Santa Claus will only give presents to children who are good!
Another Christmas tradition is the Christmas tree.
People put a small tree inside their house and decorate it with various pretty objects.
Nowadays, most people use an artificial tree instead of a real tree.
The tradition of the Christmas tree is actually older than Christmas itself
the people of Europe celebrated the beginning of the winter season in this way
even before Christianity reached Europe.
Christmas is certainly one of the most important and most enjoyed holidays in Western countries.

148,148. Thanksgiving,B1,148-thanksgiving,24,"An important holiday in North America is held during the fall, or autumn, season of the year.
This holiday is called Thanksgiving.
At this time of year, people join with their relatives to reflect upon their good fortune.
Thanksgiving is a holiday that has a long history in North America.
It was first celebrated when English settlers arrived in the eastern part of what is now
the United States, during the seventeenth century.
When they survived the first hard year, they celebrated and gave thanks to God.
They invited some of the Native people to their Thanksgiving celebration,
because the Native people had helped them to survive during the hard winter.
The tradition of celebrating Thanksgiving continued and spread throughout North America.
Each fall, during the time of the autumn harvest, people celebrated Thanksgiving.
They gave thanks for the food of the harvest, and for all the good things in their lives.
Today, the tradition of Thanksgiving celebration continues.
Families gather to eat a large bird called a turkey.
They also eat pumpkin pie.
This is a sweet dessert that is made from a large orange vegetable that grows on the ground.
In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November.
But the following day, Friday, is also a holiday, and then comes the weekend.
In Canada, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October.
The reason for the earlier celebration in Canada
is that the weather is colder than in the United States.
This means that the harvest happens earlier in Canada,
so Thanksgiving is held at an earlier date.
But in both countries, Thanksgiving is a very pleasant time of year.

149,149. Halloween,B1,149-halloween,33,"The holiday called Halloween is celebrated on October 31st of each year.
Halloween is not an official holiday.
Everyone goes to work or to school on Halloween, just as on any other day.
But Halloween is still one of the holidays that children like the most.
Why do children like Halloween so much?
There are two reasons: costumes and candy.
On the evening of October 31st,
children dress up in strange and unusual costumes.
They wear costumes that may look like a witch,
a monster, or many other weird things.
Putting on these scary costumes is a lot of fun for children.
After the children put on their costumes, they walk from house to house during the evening.
The children carry large bags with them.
At each house, they stop and knock at the door.
When an adult opens the door, the children shout ""trick or treat"".
The adult who opens the door pretends to be frightened,
and then puts pieces of candy into each child's open bag.
At the end of the evening, the children have visited many houses and have collected much candy.
During the next several days, they can feast upon the sweet candies that they have received.
Another Halloween tradition is very unusual.
In each house, a family gets a very large, round orange vegetable called a pumpkin.
They cut a hole in the top of the pumpkin,
and empty out the flesh and seeds of the vegetable.
Then, they cut holes in the side of the pumpkin,
so that it appears to have eyes, a nose, and a mouth.
When the carving is finished, the pumpkin looks almost like a person's face!
When the pumpkin has been carved to look like a face,
people place a light inside the pumpkin,
so that the vegetable seems to glow in the dark.
This strange-looking face is called a ""Jack O' Lantern"".
On Halloween evening, one can see many of these Jack O' Lanterns,
some of which are very beautifully carved.
Halloween is truly a fun and interesting holiday, especially for children!

150,150. Easter,B1,150-easter,28,"Traditionally, Easter has been one of the most important holidays of the Christian religion.
For Christians, the Easter holiday celebrates the death of Jesus Christ,
who died for the benefit of all people.
The exact date when Easter is celebrated is different each year,
but it is always held in early spring, during March or April.
There are two very important days that make up the Easter holiday,
which occurs during the spring season.
The first of these days is called Good Friday.
Christians recognize Good Friday as the day when Jesus suffered and died on behalf of humanity.
The second of these days is called Easter Sunday.
Easter Sunday occurs two days after Good Friday.
Christians celebrate Easter Sunday
as the day when Jesus rose from the dead and went to Heaven.
For Christians, Easter is the most solemn holiday of the year.
Many people attend church services on Good Friday and on Easter Sunday.
Easter is also a time for celebration.
Some Easter traditions come from old springtime festivals
that existed even before Christianity.
One of the traditions associated with Easter is the painting of Easter eggs.
People take chickens' eggs, make them hollow, and then paint them with beautiful colors.
Some people paint very beautiful and complex designs on the Easter eggs.
Another Easter tradition is the Easter Bunny.
According to tradition, the Easter Bunny is a magical rabbit
that visits the homes of children on the night before Easter Sunday.
The Easter Bunny hides chocolate candies, shaped like eggs, throughout the child's house.
On the morning of Easter Sunday,
the children must search throughout the house, to find these many hidden treats!
The Easter holiday is an important time, both as a religious holiday and as a celebration of springtime.

151,151. Hobbies,B1,151-hobbies,29,"Hobbies are activities that people do in their spare time, for the sake of enjoyment.
A hobby usually involves work of some kind,
but the work is fun for the person who does it.
Some people enjoy their hobbies very much
and like to spend much time on those hobbies.
There are many different hobbies that people enjoy.
One of the most popular hobbies is gardening.
Many people enjoy growing beautiful flowers
or tasty vegetables in a garden near their house or apartment.
People who have a garden enjoy seeing the results of their work,
when flowers show their bright, beautiful colors.
But gardeners also enjoy the tasks of gardening itself.
They like to work in the soil, planting and watering their flowers.
Another popular hobby is photography.
Some people enjoy taking pictures of the people and places around them.
People who enjoy photography may sometimes buy expensive cameras
that allow interesting photographs to be taken.
But even people who have only a basic camera can still take beautiful pictures.
For many people, car repair is a favorite hobby.
Some people enjoy looking at the engine and other parts of their cars.
Those people make repairs or improvements to their cars.
Of course, this is a useful hobby,
but many people enjoy ""fixing up"" a car simply because they enjoy working with cars.
Some people collect objects as a hobby.
For example, some people collect postage stamps, and some people collect coins.
It can be very satisfying to find the missing parts of one's collection,
especially when the stamps or coins are very rare.
Of course, these are just a few of the many hobbies that people enjoy.
Do you have any hobbies that you enjoy?

152,152. Life in outer space,B1,152-life-in-outer-space,23,"People have often wondered about whether or not there is life beyond the planet Earth.
For years, the idea of intelligent life on other planets has been very popular.
Many books and movies tell stories of what those forms of life might be like.
Many scientists believe that very simple forms of life are likely to exist on many other planets.
Under the right conditions, simple life forms might arise.
Those conditions, which include moisture and warmth, might occur in many parts of the universe.
Fewer scientists believe that very intelligent forms of life are likely to exist on many other planets.
For intelligent life to evolve, a very long period of time is needed.
During that time, the conditions on a planet must not be too harsh.
Otherwise, the evolving life forms will die.
The amount of water, heat, and various chemicals must be ""just right"".
If not, then complex life might never evolve.
The conditions needed for intelligent life to evolve are very unlikely to occur on any one planet.
However, some scientists believe that intelligent life might be common in the universe.
Because there are so many stars and planets in the universe,
there might be a few places that have intelligent life.
However, those places are probably very, very far away.
Other scientists disagree.
They think that the conditions needed for intelligent life are extremely rare.
Because of this, our planet might be the only place that has intelligent life!
So far, it is impossible to know whether or not there are intelligent beings on other planets.
But even if those beings do exist,
it seems very unlikely that we will ever meet them.

In my city, there are three different newspapers,
and I look at different newspapers on different days.
I find that each section of a newspaper has some interesting information.
Most newspapers contain several sections that can be easily removed from the rest of the newspaper.
The main section is found at the front of the newspaper.
This section usually contains the most important news from around the world,
from around the nation, and from the local area.
Sometimes the main section also includes some pages that contain opinions about the news.
The editors of the newspaper write an editorial opinion.
Other writers provide many different opinions about current events.
Also, some readers of the newspaper write letters to the editor, in which they express their opinions.
Another popular section of the newspaper is the sports section.
This section contains information about many different sports events.
The sports section provides scores and results from many games and competitions.
Another section of the newspaper contains information about entertainment and the arts.
The arts and entertainment section tells readers about new movies and plays.
It also describes new books, music concerts, and art exhibits.
Most newspapers also have a business section.
This section provides information about new business deals, and about the stock market.
Many people read the business section of the newspaper to gain information and advice about investing their money.
Finally, newspapers usually have a section for classified advertisements.
This section allows people to advertise about things they want to buy or sell.
It also gives notices about job openings.
Reading the newspaper's surely a good way to keep informed about many different events in the world around us.

154,154. Summer jobs,B1,154-summer-jobs,25,"In North America, many young people attend high school, college, or university.
But during the summer months, most of those students work at a summer job.
For most students, there are no classes during the months of July and August,
and sometimes none in May and June also.
Having a summer job allows students to make money that they will need during the rest of the year.
They need this money because it costs a lot of money to pay for university or college.
Of course, students also want money to spend on things that are fun, also.
Many students have summer jobs that involve working with children.
For example, some students work at children's camps, where they teach children various skills and games.
Some students work as lifeguards, at swimming pools and at beaches.
Some students do heavy work in their summer jobs.
For example, some students find jobs as construction workers.
Other students work in factories, and some students work on farms.
There are other students who find jobs mowing lawns or collecting trash.
Quite a few students work in stores.
Some of these students have jobs as cashiers,
and some have jobs putting products on store shelves.
Other students work in restaurants, as waiters or as cooks.
Other students work in offices.
Some of them work as assistants for other employees.
Their tasks might include typing letters, programming computers, or delivering mail.
Some students enjoy their summer jobs very much,
and they find those jobs to be a pleasant break from studying.
Other students do not really enjoy summer jobs, but find their jobs to be a nice way to make new friends.
But nearly all students who have summer jobs are pleased to have the chance to earn some extra money.

155,155. Eating out,B1,155-eating-out,40,"Many people enjoy the experience of going out to eat at a restaurant.
It is enjoyable to eat one's favorite foods, or to try some entirely new food.
Going out to a restaurant is also fun
because it allows a change from the usual routine of eating at home.
There are many different kinds of restaurants.
One popular type of restaurant is the fast-food restaurant.
When ordering fast-food,
you must first wait in line at the front of the restaurant,
and then order food from the counter.
After paying, the food is quickly delivered,
and you can then take the food to a table, where you can enjoy your meal.
In most restaurants, you don't have to go to a counter to order your food.
Instead, you're taken to a table soon after entering the restaurant.
There, a waiter comes to give you a menu.
You can choose your meal from the foods that are listed on the menu.
After ordering, it takes some time to prepare your food.
After a while, the waiter brings your meal to the table.
When you are finished eating, the waiter brings the ""bill"" or ""check"".
You then pay for the meal, and leave some extra money as a ""tip"" for the waiter.
In some restaurants, the waiter does not bring the meal to your table.
Instead, after you are taken to a table,
you then go to a counter called a ""buffet"".
There you can select different types of foods,
such as salads, soups, meats, breads, vegetables, and desserts.
After putting the food on your plate, you return to your table.
After eating, you can return to the buffet to get more food.
Other restaurants can be very fancy.
They may have beautiful decorations,
and they may have food that is prepared by expert chefs.
These restaurants may also serve fine wines with the food.
Of course, these restaurants are very expensive.
At these restaurants, it is often necessary to reserve a table by telephoning the restaurant in advance.
Different restaurants specialize in different kinds of food.
Fast-food restaurants may specialize in hamburgers or chicken.
Some restaurants specialize in steak or seafood.
Other restaurants specialize in foods that belong to a certain nationality.
For example, many restaurants specialize in Italian,
Mexican, Chinese, Indian, or Thai food.
Eating out at a restaurant can be a fun and tasty experience.

Of course, you can also listen to the radio at home, or even at work.
Listening to the radio is a popular activity for many people,
and each city has many different radio stations.
There are many different kinds of radio stations.
Some radio stations provide news and information.
Other radio stations have a ""talk"" format,
where listeners can call the radio station's experts,
to discuss political affairs or to ask for personal advice.
Although there are many radio stations that provide news and opinions,
most radio stations are mainly devoted to playing music of some kind.
For example, some radio stations play the songs that are currently most popular,
often called the ""top 40"" songs.
Other radio stations specialize in particular types of music.
There are some stations that play only classical music.
Other radio stations mainly play jazz music.
Some very popular radio stations play ""hard rock"" music.
Others specialize in country music.
Some people prefer radio stations that play rhythm-and-blues music.
Still other people enjoy radio stations that specialize in soft, ""easy listening"" music.
If you have a favorite kind of music, or even if you like to listen to all kinds of music,
you can probably find at least one radio station that you will like.
In addition to news and music, some radio stations provide other kinds of entertainment.
Sometimes, a story from a book will be told over the radio.
Occasionally, the words of a theatrical play may be heard on the radio.
Even in the age of television and computers,
the radio has remained an important source of entertainment and information.

157,157. Being a good citizen,B1,157-being-a-good-citizen,25,"Every society has laws that regulate the way people behave.
A good citizen should obey laws.
However, there is more to being a good citizen than merely obeying laws.
There are many other things that people can do to make their society a pleasant one for every person.
One way to be a good citizen is to be polite in everyday activities.
For example, when passing through a door,
a considerate person will hold the door open for a person who is close behind.
Holding doors open is especially important when someone is carrying a heavy load.
Being a good citizen is very important when travelling on the roads and streets.
Pedestrians, bicyclists, and car drivers should all follow the rules of the road.
Bicyclists should yield to pedestrians,
and car drivers should yield to both bicyclists and pedestrians.
Drivers should also allow other drivers to merge into their lanes.
Also, drivers should avoid honking their horns except when this is necessary.
A good citizen will also avoid doing things that interfere with others.
For example, a considerate person does not smoke cigarettes in areas where this might irritate others.
Also, a polite person avoids playing music so loudly that other people will be annoyed.
And of course, a good citizen avoids littering or making a mess.
Other ways of being a good citizen involve greater effort.
Some people serve their community by doing volunteer work of some kind.
Other people help by donating money to a charity.
Another way to serve the community is to donate blood.
Blood donors are needed so that there will be enough blood available to help people who are sick or injured.
Being a good citizen is very helpful for the community,
and it also gives a feeling of satisfaction and pride!

158,158. Visiting the doctor,B1,158-visiting-the-doctor,30,"When people feel sick, they go to a doctor.
But sometimes people visit the doctor even when they are not sick.
Doctors can perform a medical ""check-up"", to find out if a person is healthy.
By performing this physical examination,
the doctor can identify any health problems that might be developing.
During a check-up, the doctor examines your eyes, ears, and throat.
The doctor uses a small flashlight to examine the eyes, ears, and throat.
It is important to make sure that the eyes react normally to changes in light.
It is also important to make sure that the ears and throat have a normal appearance.
When the doctor examines your throat,
he or she will ask you to open your mouth wide and say ""ah"".
The doctor uses a stethoscope to examine the patient's heartbeat.
The stethoscope hangs around the doctor's neck.
By using a stethoscope, a doctor can hear the patient's heartbeat very clearly.
While checking the patient's heart,
the doctor also listens carefully to make sure that the patient's breathing is normal.
The doctor also checks the patient's blood pressure.
Blood pressure is measured by placing a cuff around the arm.
Air is then pumped into the cuff,
and this allows blood pressure to be measured.
Having very high blood pressure, or very low blood pressure, is not good for one's health;
it is better to be ""in between"".
Another part of the examination is a test of the reflexes.
The doctor tests the patient's reflexes by gently hitting his or her knee with a small hammer.
If a person has normal reflexes, the leg will extend suddenly.
Sometimes a doctor may give injections using a needle, as an extra part of the check-up.
These injections, called vaccinations,
prevent the patient from developing certain illnesses.
Medical check-ups can help to maintain health,
but people should also maintain their health by leading a healthy lifestyle.

There were only about 2000 people who lived in the town where I grew up.
When a town is very small, it is also called a village.
My village was surrounded by many farms and many lakes.
The house where my family lived was near the middle of the town.
On the street where we lived, most of the houses were similar in size,
but many of them had different shapes and different colors.
Each house was surrounded by a yard, where people grew their lawn and their garden.
Often, I would walk from my house to the downtown part of the village.
""Downtown"" is the area where the stores and shops of a town are located.
Because I lived in a small town, it was a short walk to the downtown area.
Along the main street, there were several different kinds of stores.
Some stores sold food, some stores sold clothing,
and some stores sold hardware (or building supplies).
It was also a short walk to the schools in my town.
When I went to elementary school, it would take about ten minutes to walk to the school.
Some of my friends lived on the same street where I lived.
Sometimes, we walked to school together.
During the summer months, many people came from the big city to visit our village.
The people liked to get away from the busy streets of the city.
They enjoyed the quietness and the slow pace of village life.
They also liked to spend their vacations near the lakes that were near the village.

He laughs about these strange sayings that we use.
He is learning English quickly because he spends a lot of time with English-speaking people.

163,163. A ghost,B1,163-a-ghost,37,"One dark and gloomy night, I was sitting in my bedroom reading ghost stories.
The stories were very scary. A storm was brewing outside my window.
The wind began to howl, and the trees shook and bent in the wind.
Lightning started to flash across the sky.
I felt uneasy as I heard the low rumble of thunder.
I glanced around my room.
The shadows were deep and dark.
The ghost stories were making my imagination play tricks on me.
I thought that the shadows were moving.
I looked under my bed to make sure that nothing was under there.
I hid under the covers and peeked out.
I was starting to hear things.
A big streak of lightning flashed across the sky,
and a loud clap of thunder made me jump.
I was very nervous.
All of a sudden, I heard a noise.
It was coming from my closet.
I thought that it must be a ghost.
I looked out from under my covers and waited for the ghost to appear.
My face was white, and I was very, very scared.
Then, I heard the noise again.
Yes, there was definitely a rustling in my closet.
I stayed very still and did not make a sound.
I watched the closet and hoped that the ghost would not come flying out at me.
Something started to come out of the closet.
I squeezed my eyes shut.
I didn't dare look at the ghost.
I heard it come out of the closet.
I felt it jump up on my bed.
I was still too scared to look.
Then the ghost made a noise.
It said, ""meow"".
I opened my eyes and saw my kitten standing there.
It was my kitten that had made the rustling noises in the closet.
I laughed and felt very foolish.
I have decided not to read ghost stories on dark stormy nights.
I think my imagination plays tricks on me when I read ghost stories on nights like that.

164,164. Louis Pasteur,B1,164-louis-pasteur,42,"Louis Pasteur was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
Pasteur made very important discoveries in biology and chemistry,
and the techniques he developed helped greatly develop medical science and the agricultural and food industries.
Pasteur was born in a small town in France during the year 1822.
When he was a young man, Pasteur studied science at a university in the city of Paris.
He soon did some excellent work in chemistry,
and later began his famous study of germs.
Pasteur was one of the first scientists to understand that many diseases
could be caused by extremely small, invisible organisms.
Only a few other scientists had believed this before Pasteur.
He advised doctors to wash their hands thoroughly before treating patients.
Pasteur also demonstrated that life forms did not arise spontaneously.
His research confirmed the idea,
developed by previous scientists,
that a living organism would not appear unless other individuals of its kind were present.
One of Pasteur's most important contributions
was a technique that has been named after him: pasteurization.
Pasteurization kills the germs that are found in drinks
such as milk or beer.
Because of Pasteur's technique,
people are no longer infected with diseases by drinking these liquids.
Just as important as pasteurization was a technique called immunization.
Pasteur found that a person or animal could be made safe, or immune, from a disease
by injecting the person with some weakened germs that cause the disease.
The body can resist the disease after being immunized in this way.
Today, many diseases are prevented by the use of this technique.
Pasteur's discoveries also helped to save people who had already been infected with diseases.
One such disease is rabies.
Rabies is a disease that sometimes occurs in animals.
This disease usually kills the animal,
but before dying, the animal becomes very aggressive,
and may spread the disease by biting a person or another animal.
One day, the parents of a young boy came to Pasteur.
Their son had been bitten by a dog that had the rabies disease.
The parents knew that their son would die from the disease,
unless something could be done to save him.
Pasteur agreed to help the boy,
and the immunization technique saved the boy's life.
Pasteur died in 1895.
He was greatly admired around the world for his achievements,
which have helped all of mankind.
Today, Pasteur is considered to be the greatest figure in the history of medicine.

165,165. Corruption,B2,165-corruption,44,"When an official of a government or business is acting dishonestly,
we say that this person is corrupt.
Corruption is a serious problem in many countries around the world.
There are several different kinds of corrupt practices,
including bribes, kickbacks, nepotism, and embezzlement.
A bribe is a payment of money or some other benefit,
in exchange for a decision that would not otherwise be made.
For example, an accused criminal might bribe a judge
so that the judge would make a decision of ""not guilty"".
Another example is that a business owner might bribe a government official
so that the official would allow the construction of very unsafe buildings.
A kickback is similar to a bribe,
except that the official receives some part of the money in a dishonest business deal.
For example, governments sometimes decide which company should build a road.
A company might offer money to a government official who makes the decision,
so that this company will be chosen,
even if it's not the best company for the job.
Nepotism happens when an official unfairly gives advantages to his or her relatives.
For example, a government official might hire a brother or sister to do a job
even though other people would be much better qualified for that job.
Of course, all of us want to help our relatives,
but it is wrong to do this at the expense of the public.
Embezzlement happens when an official secretly steals some money from a company or government.
For example, a manager at a company
might secretly move some of the company's money to his or her own bank account,
and that manager might lie about his or her expenses
in order to receive more payment from the company.
Corruption has very bad effects on people, in several ways.
Sometimes it can lead to very dangerous situations.
One example of this is when unsafe construction projects are approved by officials who have been bribed.
Another example is when criminals are freed as a result of bribes.
Also, a country's economy can be damaged by corruption.
For example, if companies must pay bribes in order to do business,
then they may decide to leave the country.
Also, if people's tax money is stolen by corrupt officials,
this makes the people poorer.
In addition, when company officials are corrupt,
it makes the company less able to compete with other companies.
How can corruption be stopped?
An important step is for each person to decide not to act in ways that are corrupt.
People must agree to take this problem seriously.
Also, each company and each government must have strict rules about corruption.
It must be very clear to all employees from the lowest to the highest
that corruption is totally unacceptable.

166,166. Canada provinces and territories,B1,166-canada-provinces-and-territories,57,"Canada is one of the largest countries in the world.
It is located in the northern half of the continent of North America, above the United States.
Canada is divided into ten provinces and three territories,
each of which is different from the others.
The province of British Columbia is located at the far western end of Canada.
British Columbia stretches from the Pacific Ocean, at the west,
to the Rocky Mountains, at the east.
British Columbia contains the city of Vancouver, where two million people live.
Most of the land of British Columbia is very mountainous,
with vast forests covering the mountains.
In British Columbia, forestry is an important industry,
providing wood for people around the world.
Moving east from British Columbia, the next provinces are
Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.
These are known as the prairie provinces,
because they are mostly made of flat, grassy land called ""prairie"".
Alberta is the province where the flat prairie meets the tall beautiful Rocky Mountains.
In Alberta, there are many fields where oil and gas are found,
and there are also many farms where cattle are raised.
Saskatchewan is the province that grows the most wheat.
Wheat from Saskatchewan is sent around the world
to make bread and pasta for many people.
Manitoba is the other prairie province.
Its largest city, Winnipeg, is about halfway between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
Winnipeg has the coldest winters of any large city in the world,
with temperatures sometimes reaching -40 degrees Celsius!
Moving east, the next province is Ontario.
The land in the northern part of Ontario is very rocky
and contains many thousands and thousands of lakes.
Many mines are found in northern Ontario.
In the southern part of Ontario, there is good farmland,
and there are also many cities where factories produce cars and steel.
Ontario contains Canada's largest city, Toronto,
as well as the capital city of Canada - Ottawa.
In the southern part of Ontario are four of the largest lakes in the world,
known as the Great Lakes.
Next to Ontario is the province of Quebec.
Unlike the other provinces, where most people speak English,
most of the people in Quebec speak French.
The capital of Quebec is called Quebec City,
and this is one of the oldest cities in North America.
Quebec City contains many buildings that are hundreds of years old.
Also in the province of Quebec is the city of Montreal.
Of all the French-speaking cities in the world, only Paris is larger than Montreal!
In the eastern part of Canada are the Atlantic provinces,
which are next to the Atlantic Ocean.
These provinces are New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,
Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland.
In the Atlantic provinces, fishing is an important industry.
Tourism is also important as many people come to see the beauty of these provinces.
The people in these provinces are said to be the friendliest in Canada.
In the far north of Canada are the three territories that lie beside the Arctic Ocean:
Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.
Many of the people in these territories are the Native people of Canada,
known as the Indians and the Inuit.
The northern areas have very cold, dark winters.
The summer is short, but the days are very long and bright.

167,167. Two great artists: Leonardo and Michelangelo,B1,167-two-great-artists-leonardo-and-michelangelo,44,"Many people admire the paintings and sculptures that artists create.
Some very beautiful paintings and sculptures were created by two men
who lived in the same country at the same time.
These men were Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.
They both lived in Italy around the year 1500.
Leonardo da Vinci is most famous for his painting called the Mona Lisa.
This is perhaps the best-known painting in the world.
The Mona Lisa shows the head and shoulders of a dark-haired woman.
When people look at this painting, they are often captivated by her smile
and by her eyes, which have a look of mystery.
Another painting of Leonardo's is called The Last Supper.
This painting shows a famous scene from the Christian religion.
In this painting, Jesus Christ is seated at the middle of a long table,
with his followers (the disciples) seated around him.
Many of the paintings that were created at this time have a religious theme.
Leonardo was not only an artist; he was also interested in engineering.
He actually worked for some time as an adviser to a military leader,
helping him to develop new machines for use in war.
Leonardo also made rough drawings of machines
that are similar to those that were invented much later,
such as submarines and helicopters.
Obviously, Leonardo was an extremely creative man.
Michelangelo was about 23 years younger than Leonardo.
In addition to being a painter,
Michelangelo was also a sculptor,
and many experts consider him the greatest sculptor of all time.
One of his most famous sculptures is David,
which is a statue of a young man who was a famous figure in the Bible.
Another great sculpture of Michelangelo is called the Pieta.
The Pieta shows Mary, mother of Jesus, holding the baby of her son across her lap.
Michelangelo is also famous for painting the ceiling of a church known as the Sistine Chapel.
The leader of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Julius,
asked Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of this new church.
This project required many years of hard work,
and the Pope complained that it took too long.
However, when the work was finished,
the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was covered with beautiful paintings
of many scenes from the Bible.
Fortunately, many of the works of Leonardo and of Michelangelo
can still be seen today in art galleries of Europe.
During the past 500 years,
the color of the paintings had faded somewhat,
but in recent years,
some work has been done to restore the paintings to their original appearance.

168,168. The Vikings,B1,168-the-vikings,41,"About a thousand years ago, people known as the Vikings were known and feared throughout Europe.
The Vikings were the people of the northern part of Europe, called Scandinavia,
which includes the modern countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
The Vikings made their living by farming and fishing.
However, by about the year 700, they began making attacks,
or raids, upon towns along the coasts of Europe
in order to steal the wealth of those towns.
The Vikings made their attacks very quickly and without any warning.
They were very cruel to the people of the towns they attacked,
and they sometimes destroyed the towns by burning down the buildings.
In some parts of Europe, the local kings would often fight against the Vikings.
Sometimes, however, the kings would pay the Vikings in order to persuade them not to attack.
Although the Vikings were known as fierce warriors,
they also built excellent ships.
The wooden Viking ships, called longboats, were able to sail even in very bad weather.
Many Viking longboats were about 20 meters long,
but some were nearly 90 meters long.
The Viking sailors used both sails and oars to move their ships.
The Vikings travelled across a large area.
They made many of their attacks in Britain, France, and Germany,
but sometimes sailed south, into the Mediterranean Sea.
Other Vikings moved to the east, and then south along the rivers of Russia.
Some even went as far as the area that is now the country of Turkey.
In some places, the Vikings decided to stay.
Many Vikings settled in England and in France,
and eventually they mixed with the local people.
Other Vikings settled in Russia and also mixed with the people there.
The most famous travels of the Vikings were in the Atlantic Ocean.
Vikings sailed westward to the island of Iceland where many of them stayed.
Today, the people of Iceland were descended from the Vikings.
Some Vikings sailed farther west to the cold island of Greenland.
Vikings lived in Greenland for several generations,
but eventually they died out.
Some Vikings had gone even further west
and reached the Canadian island of Newfoundland.
The Vikings only stayed for a few years,
but they had reached North America about 500 years before Christopher Columbus!
Gradually, the Vikings became converted to the Christian religion.
They also stopped raiding the towns of Europe,
and instead of fighting, they began trading with their neighbors.
Today, the Scandinavian countries are known as very peace-loving nations.

169,169. William Shakespeare,B2,169-william-shakespeare,44,"There has been many great writers in the history of English literature,
but there is no doubt about which writer was the greatest.
Many people consider William Shakespeare to have been the best writer who ever lived.
William Shakespeare was born in the town of Stratford, England, in the year 1564.
When he was a young man, Shakespeare moved to the city of London,
where he began writing plays.
His plays were soon very successful,
and were enjoyed both by common people of London
and also by the rich and famous.
In addition to his plays, Shakespeare wrote many short poems and a few long poems.
Like his plays, these poems are still famous today.
Shakespeare's most famous plays include
Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Hamlet,
King Lear, Othello, and Julius Caesar.
Usually, Shakespeare did not invent the stories that he told in his plays.
Instead, he wrote his plays using stories that already existed.
However, Shakespeare's plays told these stories in a more interesting way than ever before.
Some of the stories were tragedies, some were comedies,
some described historical events.
In his plays, Shakespeare revealed a very wide knowledge of many areas of life.
The characters in his plays discuss many different topics,
often with the knowledge of experts.
But what is even more impressive about these plays
is Shakespeare's use of the English language.
His vocabulary was very large,
and Shakespeare seemed to have introduced many words to the language!
Also, many of the phrases that are said by Shakespeare's characters
are now used in everyday conversation.
Today, writers often use quotations from Shakespeare's plays in their own works.
But perhaps even the most impressive features of Shakespeare's plays
are the characters within them.
The many characters in his plays seem very different from each other,
but they seem very realistic.
The emotions they feel, the words they say, and the actions they perform
are all easily understood.
Many people who watch one of Shakespeare's plays will find that they know people who remind them
somewhat of the characters in those plays.
Shakespeare died in the year 1619,
but his writings are still popular today,
400 years after they were written.
The poems and plays are greatly admired by experts in literature,
but also by people in general.
Each year, hundreds of thousands of people enjoy attending performances of Shakespeare's plays.
No other writer in the English language has remained so popular for such a long time.

170,170. Ice hockey,B2,170-ice-hockey,37,"One of the most popular sports in northern countries is the game of ice hockey.
Each winter, this sport is played by hundreds of thousands of children and adults in North America and in Europe.
Ice hockey is a fast and exciting game that can make winter much more enjoyable.
The game of ice hockey is played on a flat surface of ice called a rink.
The rink is about 60 meters long,
and about 25 or 30 meters wide.
At any time, each team has six players on the ice.
On their feet the players wear skates,
whose thin metal blades allow fast movement along the ice surface.
Learning to skate requires time and practice,
but many people can skate very quickly and smoothly.
In many ways, ice hockey is similar to soccer.
However, unlike soccer, there is no large ball used in hockey.
Instead, the players use a hard, black, rubber disk, which is called a puck.
The players skate around the ice, trying to get the puck.
They do not use their hands or feet to control the puck.
Instead, they carry long wooden sticks, which are shaped in such a way
that it is easy to push the puck along the ice.
The players can pass the puck to each other by sliding it across the ice.
To score a goal, a hockey player must shoot the puck into the net of the opposing team,
but this is a difficult task.
The net is less than two meters wide,
and is protected by a player called the goaltender.
However, some players can shoot the puck very suddenly and with great power.
Sometimes, the sport of ice hockey can be quite rough.
Players try to take the puck from their opponents by bumping into them at high speed.
This is called a ""body check"".
Players are not allowed to hit each other with their sticks.
If a player does this, then that player must be given a penalty by the referee,
who enforces the rules of the game.
Naturally, the sport of ice hockey is most popular in countries that have cold winters.
Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Germany.
In addition, many people play hockey in the United States.
In previous generations, ice hockey was considered a sport for men and boys only.
However, in recent years, women and girls have been playing hockey much more frequently than in the past.
Not only do many girls enjoy playing hockey for fun,
but now women's hockey is officially a sport at the Winter Olympics.

171,171. Chinese people in North America,B2,171-chinese-people-in-north-america,41,"In recent years, many people have moved to North America from China,
but many people do not know that Chinese people
have a long history in Canada and the United States.
During the nineteenth century, both Canada and the United States
were rapidly expanding to the west, toward the Pacific Ocean.
In those days, there were of course no cars or airplanes to allow people and goods to move across the land.
Instead, the best method of long-distance transportation was the railroad.
Railway trains could move quickly across the countryside.
However, there was one problem:
before the railway trains could run,
railroads had to be built across very long distances.
To build the railroads was a very big job.
Many men would be needed because the distance was so long and the land was so difficult,
with many mountains and rivers to be crossed.
For the men who owned the railroad companies,
it would have been too expensive to hire Canadian or American men to build the railroads
because those workers would only work for high wages.
The railroad owners decided to get workers from overseas.
Many Chinese men were willing to work for low wages because they were very poor.
These men would work very hard and send much of the money back to their relatives in China.
Thousands of Chinese men were brought to North America to work on the railroads.
They did good work, but their employers treated them badly.
The work day was very long, and working conditions were very unsafe.
Many Chinese men died in accidents while constructing the railroads.
Some Chinese women also came to North America,
but there were many more men than women.
After the railroads were completed, by about the year 1900,
very few Chinese people were allowed to come to North America.
Most people in Canada and the United States were not familiar with Chinese people
and did not want strangers to come to their countries.
Any Chinese person who came to North America had to pay an expensive tax.
This made it difficult for Chinese men to bring their wives and families to join them in North America.
Later, the governments of Canada and the United States made Chinese immigration illegal.
Eventually, the people of Canada and the United States realized that their laws had been unfair.
They changed the rules so that Chinese people
could immigrate in the same way that people from other countries could do so.
In recent decades, many Chinese people have moved to North America,
and have formed a very lively and successful community.
Many cities, such as Toronto, Vancouver,
San Francisco, and New York, have been enriched by Chinese culture.
Chinese people are now very prominent in North America, just as they were many years ago.

172,172. The history of the English language,B2,172-the-history-of-the-english-language,42,"Most people know that the English language is spoken by millions of people around the world.
However, few people are aware of the history of the English language.
Today, English is one language,
but in some ways it's a mixture of many different languages.
The English language is most closely related to a group of languages called the Germanic languages.
This group also includes languages such as German and Dutch.
About 1500 years ago, these languages were not yet distinct from each other.
Some of the people of Germany and the Netherlands then moved to England.
Those people were called the Anglo-Saxons,
and their language then evolved into English.
Most of the basic words of the English language
are derived from these very old Anglo-Saxon languages.
For example, words for the parts of the body,
for numbers, and for animals are mostly Anglo-Saxon words.
Some new words were brought to England over 1000 years ago
by people who came from the Scandinavian countries of northern Europe.
Many words that begin with the letters ""sk"",
such as skim and skill, are Scandinavian words.
A major change happened in the English language after the year 1066.
In that year, England was conquered by a king from the northern part of France.
He and his followers spoke French,
so French became an important language in England.
During the next few hundred years,
the English language absorbed a very large number of French words.
In fact, today's English dictionaries contain more words of French origin
than of Anglo-Saxon origin.
Part of the reason why the English language has so many words
is that it often has two words for each idea
one word of Anglo-Saxon origin, and one word of French origin.
Many more words entered the English language a few hundred years ago,
when science and technology became more widespread.
Most scientific and technical words are derived from words of the ancient languages of Latin and Greek.
Because there are so many of these scientific and technical words in the English language today,
the influence of Latin and Greek has been quite large.
Other languages have also contributed many words to the English language.
Some words have come from the Celtic languages,
spoken in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.
Many words have been added to the English language by immigrants
who came to North America from various countries of Europe.
Also, many more words have been adopted from the Native languages of North America,
Australia, and the Pacific, and from the languages of the peoples of Africa and Asia.
All of these words have made English a very interesting language!

173,173. African slavery in the America,B2,173-african-slavery-in-the-america,46,"One of the most tragic parts of the history of North and South America
is the period of African slavery.
For hundreds of years, many people were taken from Africa, by force,
to work in the fields of many different countries in North and South America.
When Europeans first came to the Americas,
some of them realized that they might make money by growing crops and selling them in Europe.
However, in order to make money,
they would need a cheap source of labor.
Few Europeans would come to the Americas to work for low wages,
so instead, the landowners looked for slaves.
In the areas of great farms, or plantations,
there were few Indians, so they used another source of slaves: Africa.
The plantation owners usually obtained slaves by buying them from local kings in western Africa.
This led to many wars between rival kings within Africa,
who tried to capture each other's people in order to sell them as slaves.
A few kings tried to avoid the slave trade, but this was very difficult.
During a period of several hundred years, from the 1500s to the 1800s,
about 12 million people were taken from western Africa to the Americas.
Many more people died as slaves before leaving Africa,
and many more died on the ships that took them to the Americas.
This was because the conditions on the ships were extremely unhealthy:
the ships were far too crowded, and there was little food and water.
When the African slaves arrived in the Americas,
the plantation owners made them work on farms that produced goods such as cotton and sugar.
In many places, they worked very hard,
and many of the slaves died from overwork.
They were then replaced by other slaves who arrived from Africa.
However, many slaves survived despite the brutal conditions.
In some places, the African slaves were able to revolt against the plantation owners.
However, this was difficult because the slaves who had recently arrived spoke many different languages
Some slaves escaped into wilderness areas
and were able to remain free from the plantation owners.
As time went by, many people in Europe and in the Americas realized that slavery was wrong.
By the 1830s, slavery had been ended, or abolished,
in islands owned by the British, and in parts of the United States.
In the southern United States,
slavery was ended in the 1860s, during the Civil War.
In some countries, such as Brazil and Cuba,
slavery only ended in the 1880s.
Today, many millions of people in North and South America
are descendants of slaves who were brought from Africa.
The effects of slavery have lasted for many generations,
and there was much racial prejudice against African people when slavery ended.
However, some have achieved success despite these disadvantages.
Today, the people of African background in North and South America
are a very important part of the population in many countries.

174,174. The history of trial by jury,B2,174-the-history-of-trial-by-jury,41,"In most English-speaking countries, a person who is accused of a crime has the right to a ""trial by jury"".
In a trial by jury, the guilt or innocence of the accused person
is decided by a group of 12 people, called jurors,
who must listen to the evidence about the case.
The idea of a trial by jury is over 800 years old,
but there was a time when criminal cases were decided in other ways.
Today, many of these methods seem ridiculous and cruel.
Many accused people were forced to undergo a trial by ordeal.
There were several different kinds of this trial.
For example, in the ordeal by fire,
an accused man was forced to carry a red-hot piece of iron in his hand.
People believed that if the man were innocent then the gods would protect him,
and his hand would not be burned or blistered by the iron.
Another form of the trial by ordeal was the ordeal by combat.
If one person accused another of a crime,
they would be forced to fight each other with some weapon.
People believed that the gods would help the man who was right
and allow him to win the fight.
Yet another kind of ordeal was the ordeal by water.
If a woman was accused of a crime, such as witchcraft,
she might be thrown into a river with rocks attached to her.
People believed that the gods would help an innocent woman and allow her to float on the water.
Gradually, people realized that the trial by ordeal was a completely worthless way to judge a person's innocence or guilt.
They wanted a less barbaric way to decide criminal cases.
During the twelfth century, a new method was introduced by one of the kings of England, Henry the Second.
Henry said that criminal cases should be decided by the opinions of twelve honest men
who knew about the crime, the victim, and the accused person.
This was the beginning of trial by jury in English-speaking countries,
and the method soon became very popular.
People trusted this new method much more than they trusted the old methods.
Later, the system of trial by jury changed somewhat.
Instead of having a jury of twelve men and women who knew about the crime,
juries were chosen so that the twelve people did not know anything about the crime.
This change ensures that the jurors do not have any bias or prejudice about the case.
When jurors do not know any of the people involved in the case,
their decisions are more likely to be fair and accurate.
Today, citizens in many countries are called occasionally for jury duty.
This can be inconvenient for people who are busy with their work and family life.
However, many men and women are willing to serve on juries
because of a feeling of responsibility to society.
The use of juries in criminal cases helps to ensure that justice is done.

175,175. Benjamin Franklin,B1,175-benjamin-franklin,45,"Benjamin Franklin was one of the most famous people in American history.
He was never a President of the United States,
but he made great achievements in many areas of life,
including business, literature, science, and politics.
Benjamin Franklin was born in the city of Boston, during the year 1706.
In his early years, Franklin was very poor.
As a young man, he worked for his older brother, who was a printer.
However, the two brothers soon argued with each other.
Benjamin decided to leave, and he moved to the city of Philadelphia.
He worked very hard and soon became a successful printer.
He published his own newspapers,
and he also published books called almanacs,
which contained many wise sayings.
Many of the wise sayings in Franklin's almanacs are still repeated today.
Franklin's printing business was very successful,
but he was also very interested in science.
He performed experiments on the topic of electricity.
Some of these experiments were very dangerous.
In one experiment, Franklin was almost killed
when he went outside during a lightning storm
and flew a kite that had a metal key attached.
However, Franklin was lucky enough to avoid injury,
and he learned new facts about electricity.
In addition to scientific research, Franklin was also an inventor.
He invented a new kind of eye-glasses called ""bifocals"".
Bifocals are eye-glasses that allow people to see things that are far away,
but also allow them to read things that are very close.
Another invention was a new kind of stove for burning wood.
This new stove was much more efficient than the older stoves had been.
He also invented a lightning rod, which keeps houses safe from lightning.
Franklin was also interested in making his city a better place to live.
He started a public library, and he helped to organize a hospital and a fire department.
In addition, he supervised the postal service,
which operated profitably under his command.
In his later years, Franklin became heavily involved in politics.
For most of Franklin's life, the United States was not yet a country.
Instead, the united states were still colonies of England,
but Franklin encouraged other Americans to become an independent country.
When the United States became a country,
Franklin became the American ambassador to France.
The French people liked Franklin very much.
Franklin later returned to the United States, and he died in 1790.
Today, many Americans still admire the brilliant achievements of Benjamin Franklin,
who did so much to improve people's lives.
The picture of Benjamin Franklin can be seen on the American hundred-dollar bill.

176,176. The Inuit,B1,176-the-inuit,39,"Not many people would want to live in the Arctic areas of northern Canada, Alaska, and Greenland.
In these places, the summers are very short, and the winters are extremely cold and dark.
However, there are some people who have made this land their home for many generations.
These people are called the Inuit.
The word ""Inuit"" means ""person"" in the language of the Inuit, which is called Inuktitut.
Before modern times, the Inuit had to survive by hunting.
Because their homeland was in such a cold, northern place,
the Inuit could not make a living by farming or by gathering plants.
Many of the animals that the Inuit hunted are mammals that live in the water.
For example, the Inuit used boats to hunt whales.
Also, they hunted seals by waiting for the seals to rise to the surface of the water.
Sometimes, the Inuit would hunt land mammals, such as polar bears.
When eating the meat of the animals that they hunted,
the Inuit often ate the meat raw.
This was necessary because only raw meat could provide them with enough nutrients to survive in a place
where fruits and vegetables were not available.
In previous times, the Inuit were known as the ""Eskimos"",
which means ""people who eat raw meat"".
However, the Inuit did not like this name.
The Inuit invented many useful tools for surviving in the cold, northern areas.
They sewed warm clothing from the furs and skins of the animals they hunted.
For transportation, they used dogs, which could pull them in sleds across the snow.
For making heat and light, they used lamps that burned the fat and oil of whales.
The Inuit were famous for their houses made of snow, which were called igloos.
The igloos were made by cutting blocks of snow
and then using these blocks to build a small round-shaped house.
People could enter or exit the igloo through a narrow tunnel.
In recent decades, the Inuit have had much contact with the modern world.
Inuit children now attend schools,
and Inuit adults work at a variety of occupations.
In some ways, the Inuit have found it difficult to adjust to the changes from their traditional ways,
but the Inuit are meeting this challenge.
In Canada, there is a new territory in the far north, called Nunavut,
where most of the people, including the leaders, are Inuit.
The Inuit are famous for their beautiful artwork.
In particular, Inuit carvings or sculptures are known for their excellent quality.
These carvings, which nowadays are made from a kind of stone called soapstone,
depict people or animals such as bears, seals, or whales.
In addition to paintings, Inuit artists have produced beautiful sketches and paintings of northern scenes.

177,177. Kings and Queens of England,B2,177-kings-and-queens-of-england,50,"Today, in the early 21st century,
most countries no longer have kings and queens.
However, some countries have remained as monarchies,
including England and its former colonies.
However, even in these countries,
the monarch is a ceremonial figure who no longer has any real power over his or her subjects.
These countries are called constitutional monarchies
because they are democracies in which the monarch remains the official head of state.
Many years ago, the kings and queens of England did have real power,
but gradually this power was transferred to the people and their elected officials.
It is interesting to examine how this transition occurred.
Even in very early times,
the king of England did not have absolute power.
He was the most powerful man in the country,
but he could not entirely force his will upon others.
If he became too demanding,
he might face opposition from powerful local land-owners.
These men, called the barons, might resist a king who tried to become too strong.
This is exactly what happened in the year 1215.
The king of England had made many unreasonable demands upon the country,
and the barons decided to resist.
They forced the king to agree to a list of rules that would limit his power.
These rules were written in a famous document called the Magna Carta.
This document described not only the rights of the barons,
but also of the common people of England.
During the next few hundred years, the kings still had much power.
However, some other people, such as the landowners
and the richer men of the towns, also had influence.
Their meetings became known as Parliaments,
and the king had to share power with the parliament.
During the 1640s, one king tried to rule without Parliament,
and tried to take away the rights of Parliament.
This led to a civil war, and the king was defeated.
England soon became a monarchy again,
but it became clear that Parliament would have more power than the king.
Until the twentieth century,
the Parliaments of England became more democratic,
as more and more people were allowed to vote.
Today, England still has a constitutional monarchy.
But not all English-speaking countries recognize the English queen.
For example, the United States became an independent country over 200 years ago
and has become a republic ever since.
In some countries, there is the debate about the future of the monarchy.
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand still recognize the queen of England as their own queen
even though those countries are no longer governed by England.
Many people in those countries want to abolish the monarchy.
They believe that their countries should now have their own head of state.
On the other hand, some people in those countries
want to keep the monarchy because it reminds them of their country's early history.
This is an ongoing topic of debate for Canadians, Australians, and New Zealanders.

178,178. Alcohol,B2,178-alcohol,42,"Alcohol is the oldest drug that is used in Western countries.
For thousands of years, people have made alcoholic beverages.
These beverages are made by allowing a process called fermentation to occur.
Alcoholic fermentation happens when yeasts or bacteria break down the sugars that occur in some liquids,
and convert some sugars into alcohol.
Many liquids, such as fruit juices, can ferment.
Thousands of years ago, alcoholic drinks were common in the Middle East.
However, the Islamic religion forbids alcohol,
so very little alcohol is consumed in this part of the world.
In European countries, and in other parts of the world,
many different kinds of alcoholic beverages are produced and consumed.
In warmer areas of Europe, people make wine by allowing grape juice to ferment.
In cooler areas of Europe, people make beer by fermenting liquids
made from water and various grains.
The process of fermentation is also used to make stronger drinks known as ""spirits"".
These drinks include vodka, whiskey, and rum.
The techniques for making good wine, beer, and spirits
have been developed over hundreds of years, and require scientific precision.
Some people have developed a great appreciation for well-made wine, beer, or spirits,
and have become experts about the many different varieties of these beverages.
Many people appreciate the taste of alcoholic beverages,
but many also enjoy the feelings that alcohol causes.
Alcohol belongs to a category of drugs called ""depressants""
because it ""depresses"" the central nervous system,
causing a person to feel less inhibited or restrained.
Many people enjoy this feeling, but when a person drinks a lot of alcohol,
he or she loses co-ordination, balance, and judgment.
Speech may become unclear, and the person may speak too much.
Some people become aggressive or depressed.
When a person is under the influence of alcohol, the person is said to be drunk.
One of the problems that can result from alcohol consumption is known as ""drunk driving"".
Some people try to drive a car after having consumed alcohol, but this is extremely dangerous.
Each year, thousands of people are killed by drunk drivers who lose control of their cars.
In recent years, attempts have been made to reduce this problem,
by public education campaigns and by strict laws and punishments.
If you drink, don't drive!
Another problem associated with alcohol is addiction, and it's known as alcoholism.
Some people drink so frequently that they develop a psychological addiction to alcohol.
This problem can have terrible consequences for a person's health, personal relationships, and career.
Alcoholic beverages are firmly a part of Western culture, and of many other cultures also.
On one hand, drinks provide many people with much enjoyment and appreciation.
On the other hand, alcohol is a drug that can be abused, leading to accidents and addiction.

179,179. The origin of Canada and the United States,B1,179-the-origin-of-canada-and-the-united-states,44,"Most people are aware that Canada and the United States are two very large countries in North America.
However, most people do not know how these countries came to exist.
The story of the creation of these countries is a very interesting one.
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
some people from England and from France moved across the Atlantic ocean.
English people lived on what is now the east coast of the United States,
and French people lived in what is now Quebec, in the eastern part of Canada.
The kings of England and France were often at war with each other.
This meant that there was often fighting in North America between the soldiers of England and France.
By about the year 1750,
there were many more people in the English colonies than in the French colonies.
When the next war began,
the English king was determined to defeat the French and gain complete control of North America.
The English assembled a large force of ships and soldiers and attacked the French at Quebec.
The French fought bravely, but they were too few in numbers, and the English won the war.
England then gained control of all of North America.
After this war, the people of the English colonies in North America
began to feel dissatisfied with their government.
They were not represented in the English government,
but they had to pay taxes to the English king.
The taxes were used to pay for English soldiers who defended the American colonies,
but the Americans did not want these soldiers.
In 1775, the American settlers began to rebel,
and in 1776 the Americans declared their independence.
For several years, there was much fighting between the Americans and the English soldiers.
For a while, it appeared that the Americans would lose, even though they fought bravely.
Then, the king of France decided to help the Americans.
He sent his ships and soldiers to America,
and they helped the Americans to defeat the English forces.
England recognized the United States of America as an independent country in 1783.
However, England kept control of Canada.
When the American colonies rebelled against England,
some of the people who lived in those colonies did not rebel.
Those people were called ""Loyalists"" because they were loyal to the king.
When the war ended, the Loyalists had to leave the country.
They moved northward to Canada, where they started new English-speaking colonies.
During the year 1812, the Americans invaded Canada,
but they were not able to conquer the country.
During the 19th century,
the people of Quebec continued to speak French and to maintain their French culture.
Meanwhile, many more people moved to the English-speaking areas of Canada.
In the year 1867,
Quebec and the English-speaking colonies agreed to form a single country, Canada.
By this time, there were two very large countries in the northern part of North America!

180,180. Hawaii,B2,180-hawaii,48,"Of the fifty states in the United States, 49 are located on the mainland of North America.
The other state is Hawaii, which consists of several islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
Hawaii is known as an especially beautiful and interesting place.
The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic eruptions
that pushed molten rock, called ""lava,"" above the surface of the ocean.
Some of the islands no longer have any volcanic activity,
but there are still active volcanoes on two Hawaiian islands,
Oahu and the ""big island"" (which is known simply as Hawaii).
One of these volcanoes, Mauna Loa,
still erupts sometimes, with spectacular explosions of lava.
Another volcano, called Mauna Kea, is now dormant.
These volcanoes are both very tall
and reach over 4000 meters above sea level.
The air above Mauna Kea is so clear and thin
that scientists use the mountain as a base for observing the stars.
The islands of Hawaii are located in the tropics,
and they are known for their beautiful weather.
The temperatures are usually in the range of 20 to 30 degrees Celsius,
and the days are usually sunny.
This weather allows people to enjoy swimming and surfing on the beautiful beaches of Hawaii.
Despite the sunshine,
most of the islands also receive enough rainfall to support many beautiful flowers and trees.
The first people to live in Hawaii were Polynesian groups
who arrived from other islands in the Pacific, well over 1000 years ago.
The islands were visited by European explorers during the late 18th century.
During the early 19th century, the islands became unified under a single king.
However, during this time,
many Hawaiians died from diseases that were brought by European and American visitors.
The Hawaiian islands are excellent places for growing sugar cane and pineapples.
In the late 18th century, some Americans began large farms, called ""plantations,"" in Hawaii.
The Americans eventually gained control of the government,
and Hawaii became a territory of the United States.
The United States built a naval base on the island of Oahu, at Pearl Harbor.
This base was attacked by Japan in 1941, but it was soon repaired.
The naval base is still in use today.
During the 19th and 20th centuries,
there was great demand for labor on the sugar and pineapple plantations.
People came to Hawaii from many lands,
and Hawaii became a place of many cultures.
The native Hawaiians mixed with people from places such as Japan,
China, Korea, the Philippines,
Portugal, and Puerto Rico, as well as the mainland United States.
Today, many Hawaiians can claim a diverse heritage.
In 1959, Hawaii became the 50th state of the United States,
with the city of Honolulu as its capital.
Today, there are more than one million people in Hawaii,
more than half of whom live in Honolulu.
Each year, many more people visit Hawaii as tourists, to experience the beauty of these islands.

181,181. Charles Darwin,B2,181-charles-darwin,42,"Charles Darwin made what might be the most important scientific discovery of all time
""the theory of evolution by natural selection"".
It was Darwin who first understood how it was that plants and animals evolved over time
to produce new and different species.
At first, this theory faced much opposition,
but since that time it has been supported by evidence from many areas of science.
Darwin was born in a small town in England in 1809.
When he was a young man, he went to university,
first to study medicine, and later to study religion.
However, Darwin found his schoolwork to be very boring.
Instead, he preferred outdoor activities and was very interested in nature.
While Darwin was at university,
the British navy was planning to send one of its ships, called the Beagle, on a voyage of exploration.
As part of this voyage, the ship would need a naturalist,
who could study the various plants and animals that might be found.
Darwin was recommended for this job by one of his professors, who had been impressed by Darwin.
Darwin was chosen as the naturalist of the Beagle,
and the ship left England in 1831.
The ship's voyage took Darwin around the world,
and he observed many species of plants and animals on his trip.
In one place near South America, known as the Galapagos Islands,
Darwin observed many unusual species of birds.
Several of these birds seemed closely related to each other, but they differed in interesting ways.
For example, some birds had long beaks that could reach insects hidden in the bark of trees,
but other birds had thick beaks that could break open the shells of nuts.
What Darwin realized was that certain characteristics could help an animal or a plant to survive and reproduce.
Individuals that lacked those characteristics would become more likely to die without reproducing.
Over many generations, the useful characteristics would then become more and more common,
as the surviving individuals passed the characteristics on to their offspring.
Eventually, after many generations,
the changes would be so great that a new species would exist.
In this way, a single species could divide into two or more new ones.
This was called the ""process of evolution by natural selection"".
When Darwin returned to England, he studied plants and animals in more detail.
After much research, he began writing a book about his theory of evolution by natural selection.
When the book, The Origin of Species, was published in 1859,
it was very popular and very controversial.
During the next twenty years, Darwin continued his scientific research,
and he wrote several more books.
By the time of his death, in 1882,
many biologists had realized that Darwin had made one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time.
For the first time, scientists could understand the origin of the many different species of plants and animals.

182,182. Jazz,B2,182-jazz,44,"One of the most popular forms of music is known as jazz.
Each year, hundreds of thousands of people attend jazz concerts and festivals in cities around the world.
Jazz music, both old and new, is played on the radio and on home stereos.
Two of the most important features of jazz music are ""improvisation"" and ""syncopation"".
Improvisation means that music is created spontaneously by the musician during a performance.
In other words, the musician modifies some existing music in a new and interesting way.
Syncopation means that the regular patterns found in music may be broken up,
with new accents and uneven patterns being created.
The features of improvisation and syncopation are difficult to use with skill,
and require great creativity on the part of the musician.
Jazz music originated in the southern United States,
during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
It was based on African-American music that was derived in part from rhythms in western Africa.
The earliest jazz musicians were influenced by a music style known as ""ragtime"",
which was popular during the late nineteenth century.
Jazz music also incorporated some aspects of a related kind of music called the ""blues"".
By the beginning of the twentieth century,
a fully developed form of jazz was being played in New Orleans,
a city in the southern United States.
Jazz musicians played instruments such as the trumpet,
saxophone, cornet, and piano.
Jazz soon became popular and was played on the riverboats that traveled along the Mississippi River.
Some jazz musicians moved north to the city of Chicago,
and young musicians in that city developed some new forms of jazz music.
By the 1920s and 1930s, jazz was popular in many parts of the United States,
and some musicians began forming large bands,
comprising many musicians and many different instruments.
This began the period known as the ""big band"" era
when a popular form of jazz known as ""swing"" music was played.
During the 1940s and 1950s, other forms of jazz, known as ""bop"" and ""cool"" jazz, were developed.
Some people preferred these newer kinds of jazz,
but others preferred the older varieties.
By the 1960s, some jazz musicians began to experiment with different kinds of musical instruments
and with other kinds of music.
Some musicians incorporated musical styles from other parts of the world,
or combined jazz with rock music,
and today some musicians have blended jazz with rap music.
However, some people prefer the more traditional forms of jazz music.
Of course, most of the great jazz musicians of the early twentieth century,
people such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie,
Dizzy Gillespie, and Billie Holliday are no longer alive.
However, many great jazz musicians are still active,
and many younger musicians have continued this form of music.
People will continue to enjoy jazz music for a long time to come.

183,183. Australia - nature,B2,183-australia---nature,44,"Australia is the only country in the world that is also a continent.
Located in the southern hemisphere, between the Pacific and Indian oceans,
Australia is one of the largest countries in the world.
Despite its vast size, Australia does not have a large population.
In the year 2000, there were about 19 million people in Australia.
Most Australians live within a short distance of the ocean,
because much of the interior of Australia is extremely dry.
The remote areas of Australia, known as the ""outback"",
contain several sandy, rocky deserts.
Some parts of the outback receive somewhat more rainfall,
and can support some grassy vegetation.
In these areas, there are many ranches, or farms, where sheep and cattle are raised.
Although the outback of Australia is a harsh place,
some parts of it are quite beautiful.
In the middle of the Australian continent, a large red rock known as Uluru stands in the desert.
It is nearly 350 meters tall and is nearly 10 kilometers around.
Tourists come from all over the world to see this huge and beautiful rock in the middle of a flat desert.
In contrast to the dry interior areas,
the northern coast of Australia receives a great deal of rainfall.
This area is covered in thick, lush vegetation,
with tropical rain forests whose exotic trees and flowers are found nowhere else in the world.
Off the north-east coast of the continent, a large coral reef known as the Great Barrier Reef is found.
A coral reef is a structure that consists of the bodies of small underwater animals called coral,
whose dead bodies create this unusual structure beneath the surface of the water.
The reef and the underwater life surrounding it are especially beautiful.
Australia was separated from the rest of the world for millions of years.
As a result, many of the plant and animal species in Australia are very different from those in other parts of the world.
For example, many of the animals in Australia belong to a special category called the ""marsupials"".
Marsupials are mammals, but they are a special kind of mammal,
because they give birth to offspring that are not yet well developed.
In many marsupials, the offspring continue to develop, after being born,
inside a pocket or ""pouch"" on the mother's body.
The most famous marsupial is the kangaroo.
Kangaroos can travel at great speeds by hopping on their hind legs
and using their large tails for balance.
The kangaroo is a rather large animal,
with the larger individuals sometimes weighing 90 kilograms.
Another famous marsupial is the koala.
This animal is sometimes called a koala bear
because it looks somewhat like a small bear.
The koala lives in the branches of trees called eucalyptus trees.
Koalas eat the leaves of eucalyptus trees.
Of course, Australia also has people.
We will discuss the people of Australia in the next passage.

184,184. Australia - people,B2,184-australia---people,50,"The first people who lived in Australia were known as the Aborigines.
The Aborigines came to Australia by boat more than 40,000 years ago.
They are the first people in the world who are known to have used boats for transportation.
Even though many parts of Australia were very inhospitable places,
the Aborigines survived.
They lived by hunting and gathering throughout the continent,
even in the desert areas where survival is almost impossible.
The Aborigines felt a deep spiritual attachment to the land,
and they made many beautiful paintings upon the rocks of many parts of the country.
Their most famous invention is a curved hunting stick known as the ""boomerang"".
The design of the boomerang is remarkable,
because it can be thrown in such a way that it will turn around
and return to the person who threw it.
Until about 200 years ago,
the Aborigines had only a very limited amount of contact with people in the outside world.
The next people to migrate to Australia were from the British Isles.
Beginning in the late eighteenth century,
Australia was used as a prison colony,
where common criminals and political prisoners were sent from Britain.
By the middle of the nineteenth century,
many British people moved to Australia voluntarily
to begin farms or to search for gold.
By the late nineteenth century,
Britain stopped sending its prisoners to Australia, but migration continued.
After the arrival of the British colonists, the Aboriginal population declined sharply.
This was partly due to disease,
partly due to cruel treatment by settlers,
and partly due to the loss of their traditional way of life.
Today, the Aboriginal population is growing again,
and the Australian government has taken some steps to correct the injustices of the past.
The various parts of Australia were governed at first as separate colonies,
but in 1901 they joined to form a single country.
Australia continued to grow during the twentieth century,
and after World War II it attracted many immigrants from countries in Europe.
During the past few decades, many people have moved to Australia
from various parts of Asia and from other parts of the world.
Today, Australia consists of one territory (the Northern Territory)
and six states (Western Australia, South Australia,
Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland).
Tasmania is a small island off the southern coast,
and Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland
are found in the eastern part of the country.
The two largest cities in Australia are Sydney and Melbourne,
both of which are in the southeastern part of the country.
Sydney has a beautiful harbor that is one of the largest in the world,
and Melbourne has many beautiful parks and gardens.
The capital city of the country is Canberra,
which is located between Sydney and Melbourne.
Other large cities in Australia are Brisbane (in the northeast),
Perth (in the southwest), and Adelaide (in the south).

185,185. The Earth revolves around the Sun,B2,185-the-earth-revolves-around-the-sun,38,"One year is the time required for the earth to travel around the sun.
For most of history, however, people did not know that the earth moved around the sun.
Instead, people believed that the sun moved around the earth.
The old idea that the sun moved around the earth is known as the ""geocentric"" theory.
This idea was first made famous by an ancient Greek scientist, Ptolemy,
who lived in Egypt nearly 2000 years ago.
Some other Greek philosophers had suggested instead that the earth might travel around the sun.
However, this idea, which is known as the ""heliocentric"" theory, was not widely accepted.
For centuries, people in Europe did not seriously question Ptolemy's geocentric theory.
During the early fifteenth century, however,
a Polish astronomer named Nicolaus Copernicus
began to think that the heliocentric idea was right,
and that the geocentric idea was wrong.
Shortly before his death,
Copernicus wrote a book that described the mathematical details of his theory that the earth revolved, or traveled, around the sun.
Later astronomers came to agree with Copernicus's view.
One of the most famous of these was Galileo, an Italian scientist.
Galileo was famous for demonstrating that light and heavy objects fall at exactly the same speed,
unless an object is so light that it is slowed by the air.
Galileo was also the first astronomer to use a powerful telescope to observe the sky.
He discovered many unknown features of the moon, the sun, and the planets.
When Galileo announced that he believed in Copernicus's theory that the earth revolved around the sun,
some officials of the Roman Catholic Church were angry.
They argued that this theory was against the beliefs of the Church.
Some church officials disagreed with this view,
but the authorities decided that Galileo should be punished by ""house arrest""
In other words, Galileo was not allowed to leave his house.
Also, Galileo was forced to make a public statement that renounced his belief in the heliocentric theory.
At about the same time that Galileo supported the heliocentric idea,
another astronomer did some important work that supported Copernicus's view.
This astronomer was Johannes Kepler, who lived in Germany.
Kepler used the observations of previous scientists to figure out the motion of the planets around the sun.
He realized that the planets did not travel in circular paths,
but instead, in paths that were elliptical, or oval, in shape.
Kepler's discoveries showed mathematically how the planets would revolve around the sun.
Today, everyone knows that the earth moves around the sun;
but for a long time, it seemed more reasonable to believe that the sun moved around the earth.
We can thank the great scientists of the past who discovered the surprising truth.

186,186. George Washington Carver,B2,186-george-washington-carver,42,"George Washington Carver is possibly the most famous agricultural scientist of all time.
He invented hundreds of products that could be made from crops such as peanuts and sweet potatoes,
and he changed the methods of farming in the southern United States.
The story of George Washington Carver's life is interesting and inspiring,
as it shows how some people can achieve success despite adversity.
George Washington Carver was born in a small town in the American state of Missouri, in 1864 or 1865.
He was named after the first President of the United States.
George's parents were slaves.
His father was killed in an accident,
and his mother was kidnapped and later died.
George and his brother were raised by a married couple, the Carvers, who had owned George's mother.
George was often sick during his childhood, but he showed an intense interest in nature.
The Carvers taught George to read and write, and he became known locally as an expert on plants.
Later, the Carvers sent George to a school for African-American children in a nearby town.
After his graduation, George Washington Carver continued his education in the state of Iowa.
While a student in Iowa, Carver had very little money
and had to work at many jobs to afford the costs of his education.
However, his knowledge of plants was very impressive,
and after receiving his Master's degree,
he became a teacher at the college he had attended as a student.
Soon, however, Carver moved south to the state of Alabama,
where he worked as a teacher and researcher at a college for African-American students.
It was here that Carver stayed for the rest of his life,
and it was here that he performed his important agricultural research.
One problem for farmers in the southern United States
was that the most widespread crops, cotton and tobacco,
tended to remove nutrients from the soil.
Carver realized that this problem could be solved, to some extent,
by ""rotating"" the cotton and tobacco crops with other kinds of crops,
such as peanuts and sweet potatoes,
which could help to preserve the nutrients in the soil.
Carver's discoveries made the peanut, the sweet potato,
and the soybean very useful to southern farmers.
He invented the food product known as peanut butter, plus hundreds of other products.
For example, Carver found ways to produce plastics, ink,
cooking oil, paints, and cosmetics from peanuts and other crops.
Carver also developed a new variety of cotton.
Carver received many awards for his scientific research,
but he was never interested in fame or fortune.
When Carver died, in 1943,
the American government made his birthplace a national monument.
Today, Carver is still known as a great agricultural scientist.

187,187. The rights of the accused,C1,187-the-rights-of-the-accused,44,"In English-speaking countries, the rights of an accused person are taken very seriously.
Over many centuries, laws evolved in such a way that people could not be arrested or charged without a very good reason.
Of course, every country needs to enforce its laws.
This means that police officers are needed, and so are ""prosecutors""
(the lawyers whose job is to make criminal charges against people who break the laws, and to prove that those charges are true).
However, it is very important that people's freedoms are not taken away wrongly.
People should not be punished unfairly,
and people who are accused of crimes must have the opportunity to defend themselves.
In some parts of the world, people can be arrested and imprisoned for long periods of time,
without any criminal charges being made against them.
One of the most important principles of justice in English-speaking countries
is that a person cannot be held by the police unless that person is charged with a crime.
This principle is known by the Latin term, ""habeas corpus"".
According to the idea of habeas corpus,
the police are not allowed to detain a person for more than a certain period of time (usually, twenty-four hours),
unless some charge is made against the person.
A judge will order the release of a person who is not charged with a crime.
Another important feature of justice systems in most English-speaking countries
is that accused individuals have the right to be represented by a lawyer.
Most accused people want to hire an expert lawyer.
However, even if a person cannot afford to hire a lawyer,
the criminal court must provide a lawyer who will represent that person.
The lawyer for an accused person is required to defend that person as thoroughly as possible.
One of the most important aspects of justice systems in the United States and the British Commonwealth
is that an accused person must be fully informed of any charges made against them.
Also, any evidence that will be used to show the accused person's guilt
must be shared with the accused person and with that person's lawyer.
In this way, accused persons can challenge the truth of any evidence that will be used against them.
Similarly, any person who acts as a witness against an accused person
can be cross-examined by the accused person's lawyer.
This means that the statements of a witness can be challenged by the accused person.
Another important element of most English-speaking justice systems
is that evidence must be obtained fairly.
Police officers cannot simply enter a person's home to look for evidence of a crime.
They must first have a good reason to believe that a crime has been committed,
and they must obtain permission from a judge to enter the person's property.
This permission is called a ""search warrant"".
Because search warrants are required, people are free from arbitrary invasions of their property by police.
Finally, another important aspect of most English-speaking justice systems is that
trials must be held in public, where other citizens can watch the trial.
An accused person is not tried secretly.
Moreover, as discussed in another passage,
the accused person has the right to be tried by a jury of other free citizens.
All of these rules ensure that order can be maintained without taking away the freedom of innocent people.

188,188. New York City,B2,188-new-york-city,41,"New York City is the largest city in the United States,
and one of the largest cities in the world.
The city of New York has a population of over seven million people,
and the surrounding urban areas bring the total to about 20 million people.
However, New York City is not merely a very large city;
it is also known as one of the world's leading centers of financial, artistic, and media activities.
Compared with most of the great cities of the world, New York is very young.
The first permanent settlements were established during the 17th century, by settlers from the Netherlands.
Those people named their town ""New Amsterdam"",
Soon, the colony was taken over by English settlers, who renamed the city ""New York"".
New York grew quickly, and by the 19th century it was the largest city of the United States.
New York was usually the place where new immigrants to the United States would arrive.
In the 19th century, immigrants from Germany and Ireland were numerous in New York.
In the early 20th century, New York City was the home of many Jewish immigrants,
and also immigrants from Italy.
In addition, many African-American people arrived in New York from other parts of the United States,
and many persons came to New York from the American territory of Puerto Rico,
a Spanish-speaking island in the Caribbean.
In more recent decades, immigrants have arrived in New York from places all over the world.
One of the most famous features of New York City is its dramatic skyline.
New York has more tall buildings, called ""skyscrapers,"" than any other city in the world.
Many of the tallest and most interesting buildings in New York
including the Woolworth Building, the Chrysler Building, and the Empire State Building
were constructed during the early decades of the 20th century.
In addition to these impressive buildings,
New York is also known for the huge bridges that join the island of Manhattan to the surrounding areas.
The Brooklyn Bridge is the most famous of these remarkable and old bridges.
Of course, New York is famous for much more than just its architecture.
New York City's financial district, Wall Street,
and its theater district, centered on Broadway,
are the most important in the United States.
Central Park is one of the world's great urban parks,
and the art galleries, museums, and concert halls are among the greatest to be found anywhere.
The United Nations has its headquarters in New York City.
People around the world recognize the famous Statue of Liberty,
which stands on an island in the harbor of New York,
and the bustling Times Square, located in the mid-town Manhattan area.
Visitors to New York find it to be an extremely busy, fast-placed city
and are struck by the extremes of wealth and poverty that surround it.
Many people love New York City,
but even those who would not want to live in New York do agree that it is a very interesting place.

189,189. California,B2,189-california,38,"By far the most populous state of the United States is California.
Located in the southwestern corner of the United States,
California is home to a great diversity of natural environments and cultural influences.
In the year 2000, over 33 million people lived in California.
California's many mountains and valleys produce a wide variety of climates and natural regions.
In the interior, southeastern parts of the state are many areas of desert.
For example, Death Valley, which is so deep that it is below sea level, is extremely dry.
Temperatures in Death Valley sometimes exceed 50 degrees Celsius.
Other valleys are more pleasant and hospitable places.
In the central valley, many farms grow vast amounts of fruits and vegetables.
California also contains many tall, snow-covered mountains.
On the slopes of some mountains are forests that have very large trees.
Some of the giant redwood trees of California reach heights of 100 meters or more.
Many of the cities in California have Spanish names.
This is because many of those cities began as religious missions that were started by Spanish priests.
Mexico owned California during the early nineteenth century, but few Mexican people lived there.
The United States gained control of California during the 1840s,
and the discovery of gold brought many Americans and others to California.
Today, California contains some of the largest cities in the United States.
Within the greater Los Angeles area,
one can find Hollywood, known as the movie capital of the world.
Many rich people live in suburbs such as Beverly Hills,
and many poor people live in other neighborhoods throughout the city.
The Los Angeles area is home to over 15 million people,
many of whom have immigrated to the United States from Mexico and from many Asian countries.
Los Angeles is a very large city that has spread across a great area.
As a consequence, the city has many traffic jams and air pollution, or smog, is sometimes a problem.
Further north is the city of San Francisco,
one of the most beautiful cities of the United States.
The image of the Golden Gate Bridge, which crosses the harbor of San Francisco,
is famous around the world.
Also famous are the hilly streets of San Francisco
and the trolley cars that provide transportation along them.
San Francisco's Chinese community is one of the largest in North America,
and the city also contains a vibrant artistic and cultural life.
San Francisco was destroyed by an earthquake in 1906 and was damaged again in 1989.
California has always had a special place in the imagination of Americans.
This is hardly surprising, given the variety and diversity of this vast state!

190,190. Scotland,B1,190-scotland,38,"Scotland is the country that is located on the northern part of the island of Great Britain.
The Scottish people are one of the four main nationalities of the British Isles, together with the English, the Welsh, and the Irish.
Scotland and its people have played an important part in the history of the English-speaking world.
Scotland can be roughly divided into two main regions.
The lowland areas, in the southern part of Scotland, contain most of the population and the two main cities, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Most of Scotland's agriculture and industry are located in the lowland areas.
The Highland areas, together with the islands that lie off the coast of Scotland, are not so heavily populated.
The lakes and mountains of the highlands are known for their beautiful scenery.
One of the main themes of Scottish history is conflict with England.
During the Middle Ages, the English and Scottish kings were often at war.
Around the year 1300, the Scots repelled some invasions from England.
During the 1600s, though, Scotland and England had the same king,
and the countries were officially joined as ""the United Kingdom"" in 1701.
For people in the highlands of Scotland, the eighteenth century was very difficult.
Most people worked as farmers on land that was owned by a few wealthy landlords.
The landlords decided that they could make more money on the land if they evicted the farmers,
so many of the farmers were forced to leave.
The highlanders rebelled against the King in 1745, but they were defeated.
During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many people left the highlands of Scotland.
They moved to the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
During the nineteenth century, Scotland was the first country to have universal public education for children.
The country produced a great number of famous scientists and inventors during that time.
Scotland is famous for its national costume.
This costume includes the ""kilt"",
which is a knee-length skirt worn by both men and women.
The kilt is made from a fabric that contains stripes of different colors and widths,
which cross over each other to produce a pattern that is called a ""tartan"".
In the Scottish highlands, groups of related families, called ""clans"" have their own unique tartan.
Another famous part of Scottish heritage is the musical instrument known as the bagpipes.
The bagpipes have a distinctive sound that is easily recognized.
Bagpipes were originally played to intimidate enemies in battle,
but today Scottish people play the bagpipes at parades and other celebrations.
People of Scottish heritage around the world celebrate their heritage on January 25th of each year.
This day celebrates the birthday of Robbie Burns, the famous Scottish poet.
People celebrate this day at parties, where people eat a famous Scottish food called haggis.
Today, Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom,
but some Scottish people would like Scotland to become independent.
Whatever the Scottish people decide, their country will remain a unique and interesting place.

191,191. London,B2,191-london,34,"The city of London is one of the most famous cities in the world.
In previous centuries, London was the center of the British Empire.
Today, it is one of the most important cities of the emerging European Union.
London is located in southeastern England, on the Thames River.
The greater London area contains about 12 million people, and the surrounding areas contain several million more.
London was the first city in the modern world to have reached a population of one million people.
London is a very old city,
and many of its neighborhoods maintain their distinct character.
One of the most famous parts of London is the East End,
where people speak with an accent known as ""Cockney"".
One of the features of the Cockney accent is that the letter ""h"" is often not pronounced.
London's population is very cosmopolitan.
The city contains, in addition to people of English background,
large communities of South Asian, Chinese, African, and Caribbean people.
Most of these people have their origins in countries that belong to the British Commonwealth of Nations.
Many of the most famous buildings in London are located in a small central area.
This area contains several huge churches, including Westminster Abbey,
where many famous people are buried.
Another famous church is St. Paul's Cathedral,
which was rebuilt after the original was destroyed by fire in the year 1665.
The Houses of Parliament are also found in central London.
These buildings are famous for their Gothic architecture
and for the sound of the large clock, known as ""Big Ben"".
The Tower of London, which was formerly used as a prison, is now a popular tourist attraction.
Buckingham Palace, the residence of the royal family,
was first opened for public viewing during the 1990s.
London is also famous for its many impressive museums, art galleries, and theatres.
For example, the British Museum contains priceless objects from all parts of the world.
The National Gallery holds a great collection of artistic masterpieces.
The Globe Theatre has been rebuilt to appear as it did during the time of Shakespeare.
Despite its age, London remains a vibrant and busy city.
Most of the cultural and financial institutions in England are located in London,
and the city attracts many young people from other parts of England and around the world.
Of course, London is popular with tourists who come to see the many attractions of this city.

192,192. The Protestant Reformation,B2,192-the-protestant-reformation,32,"Until about 500 years ago, there was only one Christian church in western and central Europe.
People from Portugal to Poland all belonged to the Roman Catholic Church.
However, soon after the year 1500,
people in many parts of Europe broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and began their own churches instead.
This was known as the Protestant Reformation.
The leader of the early Protestant movement was a German theologian named Martin Luther.
Luther believed that many of the priests of the Roman Catholic Church had become too concerned about wealth and luxury.
Also, he disapproved of some practices in the Church.
One such practice was that priests allowed people to pay money to the Church in exchange for committing various sins.
Luther believed that it was wrong to allow people to buy the freedom to commit acts that were against the teachings of the Church.
Luther began to criticize the Roman Catholic Church in public,
and he refused to acknowledge the authority of the Church.
He said that instead he would follow the teachings of the Bible as he understood them.
The officials of the Church declared that Luther was a heretic.
However, the local German rulers did not punish Luther.
Many of them resented the power of the Church and welcomed his ideas.
Luther and other Protestant leaders disagreed with the Church on several important issues.
The Protestants believed that priests should be allowed to marry,
whereas the Roman Catholic Church believed that priests should remain celibate.
The Protestants believed that people should read the Bible for themselves,
whereas the Roman Catholic Church believed that priests should interpret the Bible for the people.
During the decades that followed Luther, the Protestant movement spread throughout much of Europe.
Over time, many different Protestant churches were formed.
During this period, many wars were fought between local rulers who favored Protestantism,
and other local rulers who supported the Roman Catholic Church.
In the end, many parts of Europe became Protestant,
such as Scandinavia, England, and parts of Germany, Holland, and Switzerland.
However, the people and rulers of many other areas of Europe preferred to remain in the Roman Catholic Church.
These areas included most of southern Europe, as well as Poland and Ireland.
The Roman Catholic Church changed a few of its practices in response to Protestant criticism, but kept its most important beliefs.
In recent times, relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the various Protestant churches have become much more friendly.
Some discussions have been held between Catholic and Protestant officials, in order to resolve some of their disagreements.

193,193. Modern engineering wonders,B2,193-modern-engineering-wonders,40,"During the twentieth century, there were great improvements in engineering technology.
These new developments allowed the construction of many amazing tunnels, bridges, towers, and office buildings.
For centuries, people had dreamed about the possibility of connecting the island of Great Britain to the mainland of Europe.
However, it was only in 1994 that such a link was completed,
when a tunnel was dug under the English Channel, between England and France.
The Channel Tunnel, also known as the ""Chunnel"",
actually consists of three separate railway tunnels.
These tunnels are about 50 kilometers long.
They are located about 150 meters below the bottom of the sea.
Obviously, this was an extremely challenging project to undertake.
As a result of the Chunnel, it is now possible to travel between London and Paris by train.
And the trip takes only three hours,
of which only 20 minutes are spent inside the tunnel!
A suspension bridge is a bridge that is supported by strong wires that hang from tall towers.
The world's longest suspension bridge is the Akashi-Kaikyo bridge, near the city of Kobe, Japan.
This bridge is nearly 4 kilometers long, and the two towers near the middle of the bridge are about two kilometers apart!
It took almost 20 years to design this bridge, and 10 years to build it.
This bridge was designed to withstand extremely strong winds,
because Japan often experiences wind storms called typhoons.
The bridge was also designed to withstand powerful earthquakes, which sometimes hit Japan.
At the beginning of the twenty-first century,
the world's tallest free-standing tower was the Canadian National Tower, or the CN Tower.
The CN tower is 553 meters tall.
It is located in the city of Toronto, within the Canadian province of Ontario.
This structure was built in 1975 as a television and radio tower.
Before the CN tower was built, TV and radio reception in the Toronto area was poor.
This was because the TV and radio signals were blocked by the buildings of downtown Toronto.
When the CN tower was built, this problem was solved.
Of course, the CN tower is also a famous tourist attraction.
People can ride in the very fast elevators that take them to observation areas,
which are at about 350 and 450 meters above the ground.
Although the CN Tower is the world's tallest tower, it is not an office building.
The tallest buildings in the world are the Petronas Towers, in the city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
and the Sears Tower, in the American city of Chicago.
The Sears Tower, which is 442 meters tall, was completed in 1974.
It has 110 floors, and its top floor is the highest office floor in the world.
However, the Petronas Towers reach slightly higher, to a height of 452 meters.
The Petronas Towers were completed in 1998.
Obviously, the late twentieth century witnessed some amazing achievements of engineering.
It will be very interesting to see what new wonders will be constructed in the twenty-first century!

194,194. Anne Sullivan and Helen Keller,B1,194-anne-sullivan-and-helen-keller,39,"The story of Anne Sullivan and Helen Keller is the story of a dedicated teacher and an eager student.
This story is very remarkable and inspiring because the teaching was done without sight and without sound.
Helen Keller was born in the American state of Alabama in 1880.
She was a happy and healthy baby, but before she reached the age of two,
she was struck by a severe fever.
As a result of this fever, she became both deaf and blind.
After her illness, the young Helen Keller learned to use her other senses.
For example, she touched other people's hands to figure out what they were doing.
In this way, she also learned that people could communicate by moving their lips.
Helen could not talk;
instead, she communicated with her family by making sign movements with her hands and body.
However, Helen became very frustrated by her inability to see, hear, and talk.
She often became very angry and had many ""temper tantrums"".
When Helen Keller was six years old, her family took her to see Dr. Alexander Graham Bell,
who was an expert on educating deaf children.
(This man was also famous for inventing the telephone).
As a result of this visit, Helen's parents hired a tutor for their daughter.
The tutor was a very intelligent deaf woman named Anne Sullivan.
At first, it was difficult to teach Helen because she still made many angry outbursts.
Gradually, Anne Sullivan gained Helen's trust.
One day, Anne began to teach Helen to communicate.
Anne took Helen to a well and pumped some water onto Helen's hand.
Then, Anne used her finger to write the letters ""WATER"" onto Helen's hand.
By repeating this, Anne was able to teach Helen how to write the word ""water"".
As soon as Helen learned that things could be named in this way,
she wanted to learn the names of many other objects and actions.
She was curious about many things, and learned a great number of words.
She also learned to read by using the Braille alphabet.
This alphabet allows the reader to feel letters and words,
which are represented by bumps on a page.
Also, Helen learned to talk by feeling and then copying the movements of people's mouths.
When Helen Keller was 16 years old, Anne Sullivan went with her to college.
Anne acted as Helen's interpreter, and Helen was very successful in her studies.
After her graduation, Helen dedicated her life to improving conditions for the blind, the deaf, and the poor.
Anne Sullivan died in 1936 and was remembered as the ""Miracle Worker"" for her triumph in educating Helen Keller.
After Anne's death, Helen continued to give lectures in countries around the world,
and was active in many political causes.
She met with presidents and prime ministers, and helped to improve conditions for people who were deaf or blind.
At the time of her death, in 1968, Helen Keller was one of the most admired people in the world.

195,195. The automobile (or car),B2,195-the-automobile-or-car,39,"In many ways, the automobile has been one of the most important inventions of the modern age.
People have been able to travel much more freely,
and across much greater distances, than was possible in the past.
The automobile, which most people refer to as the ""car""
has also had some harmful consequences, such as pollution and accidents.
However, it is clear that life has changed profoundly as a result of the car.
Modern cars are very complicated, but the basic idea of how a car works can be described briefly.
When the keys are turned in the ignition of the car,
this creates a spark that ignites some gasoline vapor inside a cylinder.
Then, the rapid expansion of this vapor pushes against a part called a piston.
The movement of the piston then causes a turning motion in a shaft that is connected to the wheels.
The wheels turn, and the car moves.
The invention of the car, and the engines used by cars,
happened gradually in the late nineteenth century, mainly in France and Germany.
In the early twentieth century, an American engineer named Henry Ford developed a new way of making cars.
Instead of having one worker produce an entire car,
he had each worker perform one part of the production of many different cars.
This system was very efficient and allowed the mass production of cars.
The first car to be produced in large numbers was called the ""Model T"".
The Model T Ford and other cars that were soon produced in large numbers
were cheap enough that many people could afford to buy them.
Many new roads were built and paved throughout North America to allow cars to be driven from town to town.
People were able to travel much more easily and to visit places that had previously been difficult to reach.
Some problems also came with the widespread use of cars.
One of these problems was air pollution, because car engines burn gasoline,
which produces poisonous exhaust fumes.
Gradually, new laws and new technology have led to reductions in the air pollution that is caused by cars.
Moreover, cars today are much more ""fuel efficient"" than they were in the past,
requiring less gasoline to travel a given distance.
However, this pollution is still a problem because of the many millions of cars that are used each day.
Another problem has been car accidents, which have caused many thousands of deaths each year.
During the 1960s, some journalists brought attention to the unsafe features of many cars.
As a result, the safety of cars has been greatly improved.
In addition, the use of seat belts is now required by law.
However, car accidents continue to be a serious problem.
The future is likely to bring many interesting new changes to the car.
Improvements in the safety of cars, in fuel efficiency,
and in the cleanliness of car emissions are continuing to be made.
Also, the increasing use of the car in economically developing countries will probably have important effects upon people's lives around the world.

and the fourth longest river in the world.
This river holds a special place in American history and literature,
and in the imagination of ordinary Americans.
The Mississippi River begins in the hills of northern Minnesota, near the Canadian border,
and flows southward about 3700 kilometers,
through ten states, before draining its water and silt into the Gulf of Mexico.
Traditionally, the river is viewed as a natural boundary between the eastern and western halves of the United States.
Until the year 1803, the areas to the west of the Mississippi River,
and the areas around the mouth of the river, were claimed by Spain and by France.
In that year, the French emperor, Napoleon, decided to sell this land to the United States of America.
This sale, which is called the Louisiana Purchase, was very important for the United States.
By controlling the Mississippi River,
the Americans would be able to use it for transporting goods and people in this rapidly developing area.
For many years, river-boats were the main method of long-distance transportation for people living near the Mississippi.
Steam-powered boats, with large ""paddle wheels"" that pushed the boat forward,
were very popular in the time before cars and airplanes.
One of the famous cities along the Mississippi River is St. Louis.
This city is known as the ""gateway to the west"".
During the nineteenth century,
St. Louis was the last large town that people would pass through on their way
to a new farmland farther west.
Today, St. Louis is famous for the ""Gateway Arch"",
a tall monument that welcomes people to the west.
St. Louis is also known as the city where the music known as ""the Blues"" began.
Near the mouth of the Mississippi River is another famous city, New Orleans.
In terms of the styles of buildings, New Orleans is said to be the most unusual American city,
because it is influenced so strongly by Spanish and French traditions.
Even today, the traditional festival of ""Mardi Gras"" is celebrated in New Orleans each year.
New Orleans and the surrounding areas of the state of Louisiana are famous for spicy ""Cajun"" food.
This style of cooking was developed by the French-speaking settlers of Louisiana.
The Mississippi River is famous in many stories of American literature.
For example, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn,
which were written by the author Mark Twain, are both set along the Mississippi River.
Today, the federal and state governments of the United States
are working to preserve the natural environment along the Mississippi River.
People recognize the importance of keeping this river healthy and clean.

197,197. Doctors Without Borders,B2,197-doctors-without-borders,37,"In 1999, the Nobel Prize for Peace was won by the organization known as ""Doctors Without Borders"".
This is the English name for the organization, based in Belgium,
which won the prize for its humanitarian assistance to people around the world,
in areas that have been struck by disaster.
The fundamental ideas of Doctors Without Borders is that people who suffer from a disaster
have the right to receive professional help as soon as possible.
The organization helps people regardless of their nationality, race, religion, ethnicity, sex, or political opinions.
Also, the assistance provided by Doctors Without Borders is given in response to all kinds of disasters,
such as famines, earthquakes, and wars.
The people who belong to Doctors Without Borders are experienced medical workers
who volunteer their time, effort, and skills in an attempt to help people who are in need.
These volunteers include doctors, nurses, surgeons, anesthetists,
laboratory technicians, and other medical workers.
There are also some non-medical volunteers
who work for Doctors Without Borders in positions of administration or logistics.
Volunteers must first take a course before participating in a humanitarian mission.
They promise to abide by a code of professional ethics,
and they promise to remain neutral in any conflicts within a disaster area.
A mission typically lasts about six months, but the duration varies.
The volunteers are insured by the organization,
but they are not paid in any way for their work.
When Doctors Without Borders began in 1971,
it consisted of only a few French doctors who wanted to provide humanitarian aid to people in disaster areas.
Over the years, it grew rapidly, and by 2001,
Doctors Without Borders had 2500 volunteers working in 80 countries around the world.
They have helped people by providing emergency health care,
vaccinations, medicine, water, and basic food
and also by developing improved water and sanitation systems.
In many areas, Doctors Without Borders has also helped to provide basic medical training to local people.
Although Doctors Without Borders remains neutral in any conflicts within a disaster area,
the organization does speak out against abuses of human rights.
By remaining independent of the influence of governments and corporations,
Doctors Without Borders is able to criticize the people and organizations who cause suffering.
The volunteers are witnesses who tell the world about the cruelty that is inflicted upon innocent people.
Obviously, the work of Doctors Without Borders is extremely important.
The volunteers of this organization are brave and selfless people
whose efforts have relieved the suffering of millions of people.

198,198. Chicago,B2,198-chicago,36,"Chicago is one of the most famous American cities.
Some cities in the United States such as New York,
Los Angeles, and San Francisco, may be more glamorous,
but many people agree that Chicago is the city that best represents the United States.
Located in the middle of North America,
Chicago has derived much benefit from its geography.
The city's central location has made its O'Hare International Airport
the ""hub"" for most airlines in the United States.
Its location on the shores of Lake Michigan has made it a major port and business center,
where the agricultural and industrial products of the American Midwest are shipped overseas.
Until about the 1830s, Chicago was a minor trading post.
But then it grew rapidly as the most important town in the rapidly developing areas of the midwestern United States.
In 1871, the city was destroyed by a fire.
It is often said that the fire started when a cow knocked over an oil lamp.
It took about 20 years for the city to be completely rebuilt,
but it continued to expand.
In 1882, the first skyscraper was built in Chicago.
Around the turn of the century, the population of Chicago was growing quickly.
Many African-American people moved to Chicago from the southern United States,
and many immigrants from Eastern Europe also arrived in Chicago during this time.
Because of the busy and active atmosphere of the city,
an American poet described Chicago as ""the city of broad shoulders"".
Chicago became notorious for organized crime during the Prohibition Era of the 1920s,
when the sale of alcohol was illegal.
Mobsters such as Al Capone became rich by smuggling liquor,
and many people were killed in conflicts between rival gangs of criminals.
But the influence of organized crime later became weaker.
In the decades following World War II,
Chicago experienced some problems with crime, poverty, and racial conflict.
However, the city has recently prospered, and social conditions have improved for many people in Chicago.
Compared with other large cities, Chicago is viewed as an affordable place to live, with a high quality of life.
The city has efficient transportation, and many beautiful parks along the Lake Michigan shoreline.
Chicago is famous for its many attractions, including the Art Institute of Chicago,
the Field Museum of Natural History, the Shedd Aquarium,
the Sears Tower, and the ""Miracle Mile"" shopping district.
Indeed, Chicago is one of the most interesting cities in the United States.

199,199. Charles Dickens,B2,199-charles-dickens,46,"Charles Dickens is considered one of the greatest writers in the history of English literature.
Dickens wrote his many novels during the nineteenth century,
but those novels remain popular even today.
Literary experts admire his genius at describing the lives and personalities of the many characters in his books.
Charles Dickens was born in England in 1812.
His father was a clerk who worked for the Navy.
Unfortunately, his father was not good at managing money,
and the family soon went deeply into debt.
In those days, people who owed money were sent to prison,
and their families were sent to places called ""workhouses"".
When Charles' father was unable to pay the debts, Charles was sent to a workhouse,
where he had to work long hours, and Charles' father was sent to prison.
After a few years, the family regained its freedom,
but the experience had a lasting effect upon Charles.
As a young man, Charles Dickens worked as a journalist in the law courts and in Parliament.
But he soon began writing stories for newspapers.
These stories were very popular with the readers.
Soon, Dickens began writing entire novels for the newspapers.
Each month, the newspaper would publish another chapter of Dickens' latest novel.
One of Dickens' most famous early novels is called Oliver Twist.
This is the story of a young man who is poor and alone in the city of London,
and becomes involved in criminal activities to support himself.
The characters in this novel have a very wide range of personalities,
but seem very real to the reader.
The book exposed the conditions that faced the poor people of London,
and helped to encourage reforms aimed at improving those conditions.
Perhaps Dickens' most popular novel is A Christmas Carol.
In this story, a rich but stingy old man, Ebenezer Scrooge,
refuses to give his employee a day off at Christmas,
and refuses to donate money to help the poor.
But, while sleeping, Scrooge is visited by ghosts from his past, present and future.
These ghosts show Scrooge how badly he has behaved.
When Scrooge wakes up, he becomes a kind and generous man
who fully appreciates the spirit of the Christmas holiday.
Another famous novel of Dickens is A Tale of Two Cities.
This is a story of the violence and upheaval during the French Revolution.
The story is famous for the heroic act of sacrifice
that is made by one character for the benefit of the others.
Dickens was famous as a public speaker,
and large crowds assembled to hear his performances.
When he died in 1870, he was a very famous man.
The novels of Charles Dickens allow the reader to experience the life of nineteenth century London,
showing the poverty and injustice that were so common.
The characters of these novels show the range of human behavior,
from cruelty and selfishness to kindness and love.
It is no surprise that Dickens is viewed as one of the great figures of English literature.

200,200. Samuel Clemens (or Mark Twain),B2,200-samuel-clemens-or-mark-twain,40,"Mark Twain was the author of some of the greatest works of American English literature,
such as Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
Mark Twain's real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens.
He used Mark Twain as his ""pen name"".
Samuel Clemens was born in the American state of Missouri in 1835.
As a child he enjoyed many outdoor activities, such as swimming and fishing.
When Samuel was eleven years old, his father died,
and he began working to help support his family.
As a young man, Samuel Clemens began to write stories for newspapers.
However, he took a job working as a navigator on the steamboats that travelled up and down the Mississippi River.
Clemens greatly enjoyed this period of his life,
during which time he gained much knowledge about life on the river.
He also learned much about human behavior by observing the many people on the boats
and along the river.
It was as a result of this time that Clemens began using his pen name, Mark Twain.
This name is taken from a term that was used by the men who worked on the river.
It is used to describe water that is just deep enough to be navigated safely.
The earliest of Mark Twain's really famous novels was The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
This novel describes a boy who engages in much mischief, but who has a kind heart.
The story contains several scenes that are quite funny.
In one of these, Tom's working at the boring task of painting a fence.
He persuades several other boys to help him,
by pretending that painting the fence is a fun and enjoyable activity.
Another famous novel by Mark Twain was Life on the Mississippi.
This book describes many interesting characters similar to those that Twain actually observed while working on a steamboat.
This story gives the reader a vivid image of the people who lived and worked along the Mississippi River.
Probably the best novel by Mark Twain was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
This novel tells the story of a boy who runs away from his violent father.
The boy, whose name is Huckleberry Finn, is joined in his escape by a man named Jim.
Jim is a slave who has decided to run away from his owners.
Huck and Jim travel north along the Mississippi, hoping to reach the areas where slavery is not allowed.
In this story, the reader can experience the moral sense of Huckleberry,
who must make several important decisions during the escape.
Mark Twain died in 1910, after writing many more novels
and many stories of his travels around the world.
Twain's works are still widely read today.
His books are appreciated for their humor,
for their interesting descriptions of life in nineteenth century America,
and for showing both the good and evil that people can do.
Many critics consider Twain to have been the greatest American writer.

201,201. The islands of the Caribbean,B1,201-the-islands-of-the-caribbean,38,"The Caribbean Sea is the large body of water that lies north of the northern tip of South America.
Within the Caribbean sea are many islands that have played an important role in the history and culture of the Western hemisphere.
By far the largest island in the Caribbean is Cuba.
Cuba was formerly a colony of Spain, but became independent in 1902.
Cuba became a Communist country in 1959,
when a revolution overthrew an unpopular government.
After the revolution, many Cubans fled to the United States.
Today, the American city of Miami, in the state of Florida,
has been greatly influenced by Cuban culture.
Tobacco is widely grown in Cuba,
and the country is famous for the cigars that are produced in the capital city, Havana.
The island of Hispaniola is located just east of Cuba.
This island is divided into two countries.
In the west is Haiti, where the people speak a variety of the French language
that has been influenced by African languages.
In the east is the Dominican Republic, where the people speak Spanish.
Another important Caribbean island is Puerto Rico.
This was previously a Spanish colony, but it's now governed by the United States.
Many people from Puerto Rico have moved to the mainland United States,
especially the New York area.
In many other islands in the Caribbean, English is the main language.
The largest of these islands is Jamaica, which is located just south of Cuba.
Most Jamaicans are the descendants of African people
who were brought to work as slaves on sugar plantations.
Jamaica is famous as the birthplace of the style of music called ""reggae"",
which was popularized in other countries by Bob Marley, a famous Jamaican musician.
Another important English-speaking Caribbean island is Trinidad.
This island is located just north of South America.
The population of Trinidad is very diverse.
The largest groups of people are descended from people who came from Africa and India,
but there are many other nationalities also.
Trinidad is famous for a style of music known as ""calypso"",
and for musicians who produce pleasant sounds by playing steel drums.
There are also many other, smaller islands in the Caribbean,
each with its own unique features.
Many of these islands possess fine beaches, and are popular tourist destinations.
The warm weather of the Caribbean makes it a popular place for North Americans
who must live through cold winters!

202,202. North American Indians,B1,202-north-american-indians,44,"The first people who lived in North America were the Indians.
The name ""Indians"" is actually not very accurate, because the people are not from India.
But when the first Europeans came to North America,
they mistakenly believed that they had reached India,
so they referred to the people as Indians.
In different parts of North America,
the Indians had very different cultures and very different ways of making a living.
On the west coast of North America, many large rivers flow into the Pacific Ocean.
In these rivers is an abundance of fish, such as salmon.
The Indians in these areas obtained much of their food by fishing.
They lived in settled villages, and became experts in carving wood from the tall trees of the area.
They carved large canoes for traveling on the rivers and oceans,
and they also carved tall ""totem poles"".
Totem poles were carvings of various animal or human figures,
and often the poles had a mythical or spiritual significance for the people who carved them.
Many beautiful totem poles can be seen in cities
such as Vancouver or Victoria, in the Canadian state of British Columbia;
or Seattle, in the American state of Washington.
The Plains Indians lived in the central prairie of North America.
The various nations of the Plains lived by hunting large animals called buffalo, or bison.
Horses were brought to North America in the sixteenth century by the Spanish.
The Indians who lived in the prairie areas had learned to become experts at riding horses,
and on horseback they could hunt the giant herds of bison.
They followed the buffalo from place to place.
The Plains Indians lived in portable houses called ""teepees"",
which were made by sewing together buffalo skins, and holding them in place with wooden poles.
In the southwestern United States, some Indians lived by farming.
In this dry area, the Indians raised several crops, such as corns, beans, and squash.
Many of the Indians in these areas lived in large settlements,
where the houses were made from stone or dried mud.
The people were experts at weaving,
and they made clothing and blankets that had beautiful artistic designs.
Near the eastern coast of North America,
many Indians lived by a combination of farming and hunting.
These people lived in fortified villages,
some of which were inhabited for many years at a time.
In some places, they built large earthworks that can still be seen today.
In the forests of northern Canada, the Indians lived primarily by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Like the Indians of the prairie regions,
they often moved from place to place in search of game animals to hunt.
Today, the Indians of North America no longer live in their traditional ways.
However, several Indian languages are still spoken by many thousands of people.
Also, many Indians in the United States and Canada
are very interested in maintaining the cultural traditions of their ancestors.

203,203. How the first World War started,B2,203-how-the-first-world-war-started,35,"During the summer of 1914, many people in Europe felt very optimistic about the future.
Modern technology was improving people's lives.
Political freedom was gradually increasing in many countries.
New artistic styles and scientific discoveries were being made.
But later that summer, a terrible war began.
In the early twentieth century, the various countries of Europe
competed with each other in an attempt to be the most powerful country on the continent.
In each country, many of the political leaders wanted to control more land, more people, and more resources.
The First World War began when the archduke of Austria-Hungary was assassinated.
Austria-Hungary wanted to punish the assassin, who was from the small country of Serbia.
This led to a serious dispute, and soon other countries were involved.
Within a few weeks, a war had begun.
On one side were Germany and Austria-Hungary,
and on the other side were Russia, France, and Britain.
The people in these countries at first welcomed the news of a war.
Many people were intensely patriotic, and supported the war effort
without thinking carefully about the reasons for the war.
Some people thought that war would bring adventure and glory to their lives,
and they cheered enthusiastically in the streets.
After the war started, it soon became clear that it was a terrible disaster.
In the western part of Europe, the opposing sides fought many bloody battles.
Soldiers on both sides lived in filthy trenches that had been dug out of the ground.
Sometimes, hundreds of thousands of men were killed in battles that lasted only a few days.
In most cases, these battles did not result in large gains or losses of territory.
The war continued for more than four years.
When the war was finally over, millions of people had been killed.
Many people realized that their eagerness to fight against other countries had led them into a great disaster.
This disaster did not end when the war ended in 1918.
During the next thirty years, there would be many violent revolutions in Europe,
and a second major war that would be even worse than the first.
Today, people in most European countries no longer view other nations as enemies.
They have no interest in fighting wars with their neighbors.
Instead, they're interested in trading with the other countries,
and in visiting those countries as tourists.
The lessons of the twentieth century have reminded people that wars can have terrible consequences.

204,204. Great Lakes,B2,204-great-lakes,37,"The Great Lakes are a group of five large freshwater lakes in North America
that are interconnected by natural and artificial channels.
They are (from east to west): Lake Ontario, Lake Erie,
Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, and Lake Superior.
Most of them, except Lake Michigan, which lies entirely within the United States,
form part of the border between the United States and Canada.
The Great Lakes are bordered by the Canadian province of Ontario and by eight U.S. states
including (from west to east)
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York.
Large cities like Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Toronto lie on the shores of the Great Lakes system.
The Great Lakes system, with a combined surface area of 244,100 square kilometers,
holds about 20% of the world's fresh surface water.
Lake elevations decrease to the east and south.
Lake Superior, the largest lake at 82,100 square kilometers,
is also the largest freshwater lake in the world.
Its outlet is the Saint Mary's River,
which enters Lake Huron after falling about 7 metres over a series of rapids.
Lake Huron and Lake Michigan lie at the same elevation.
Water flows from Lake Michigan to Lake Huron.
Lake Michigan is deeper than Lake Huron, but the latter is larger in area,
at 59,600 square kilometers.
Lake Huron drains into the Saint Clair River,
which falls about 3 metres between Lake Huron
and the small, shallow basin of Lake Saint Clair.
Lake Saint Clair's connected to Lake Erie by the Detroit River.
At its northeast end, Lake Erie empties into the Niagara River,
which drops 99 metres as it flows north to Lake Ontario,
which is the smallest of the Great Lakes at 19,010 square kilometers.
Lake Ontario is linked with the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence River.
The Great Lakes, interconnected by rivers, straits, and canals,
are a natural resource of tremendous significance in North America;
they serve as the focus of the industrial heartland of the continent
and together form one of the world's busiest shipping arteries.
The lakes also form an important recreational resource
with about 17,000 kilometers of shoreline,
rich sport fisheries, and numerous beaches and marinas.

205,205. Canadian Rocky Mountains,C1,205-canadian-rocky-mountains,35,"Some of the best-known mountain scenery on Earth is concentrated in a set of seven parks in the Canadian Rocky Mountains.
There are four national parks in the Canadian Rockies,
Banff, Jasper, Yoho and Kootenay,
and three British Columbia provincial parks,
Mount Robson, Mount Assiniboine and Hamber.
The seven preserves located along the Alberta-British Columbia border attract more than nine million people annually.
Banff National Park became Canada's first national park in 1885,
and the birthplace of Canada's national park system.
It is home to a variety of distinctive natural features and cultural and historical sites.
Rugged mountains, glaciers, icefields, alpine meadows, beautiful blue cold-water lakes,
mineral hot springs, deep canyons and hoodoos compose the natural landscape and habitat
for a great variety of mammals such as elk, bighorn sheep, black and grizzly bear, and caribou.
Jasper National Park is the largest and most northerly of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks.
The park is less commercialized than Banff,
so it can still keep many natural beauties and scenery.
Its scenery includes deeply gouged Maligne Canyon,
picturesque Maligne Lake, the thunder of Sunwapta Falls,
the serene beauty of glacier-covered Mount Edith Cavell, and Miette Hot Springs.
As one of 39 national parks in Canada,
Kootenay National Park represents the south-western slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains.
From glacier-clad peaks to semi-arid grasslands,
where even cactus grows, Kootenay is rich in variety
and is one of the largest protected areas in the world.
Yoho National Park, representing the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains region,
holds the secrets of ancient ocean life, the power of ice and water,
and unique plant and animal communities that continue to evolve today.
Awe and wonder is a natural response for this place of rock walls,
spectacular waterfalls and soaring peaks.
The Burgess Shale contains one of the world's most significant finds of soft-bodied,
Middle Cambrian-age marine fossils, with about 150 species,
including some bearing no resemblance to known animals.
These four Canadian National Parks account for 14,300 square miles.
The four National Parks along with the three British Columbia provincial parks
form the UNESCO Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site,
one of the largest protected areas in the world.

206,206. Banff National Park,B2,206-banff-national-park,31,"Banff National Park is Canada's oldest and most famous national park.
It was founded in 1885 after the discovery of the Cave and Basin Hot Springs.
From humble beginnings as a 26 square kilometer hot springs reserve,
Banff National Park now consists of 6,641 square kilometers of unparalleled mountain scenery
nestled in the heart of the magnificent Canadian Rockies.
Each year, millions of visitors come to Banff to marvel at the emerald waters of Lake Louise,
walk amongst the flower-filled heavens at Sunshine Meadows,
and drive beneath the towering jagged peaks lining the Icefields Parkway between Banff and Jasper.
Ten thousand years ago, natives camped on the shores of the Vermilion Lakes
beneath the windswept peak of Mount Rundle.
They were the only people here to enjoy the mountain landscape, the beautiful sunrises and the hot springs.
Nearly ten millennia later,
a struggling nation forged a crazy dream of connecting itself from sea to sea with steel rails,
and from this railway venture was born Canada's most famous park, Banff National Park.
Banff National Park contains some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in the world.
Snow-capped peaks, glistening glaciers, icefields, alpine meadows,
blue cold crystal clear lakes, raging rivers, mineral hot springs,
deep canyons, hoodoos and sweeping vistas
are just one part of the allure of Banff National Park.
The park is also the home of some of North America's wildest creatures,
including black and grizzly bears, caribou and wolves.
Banff and Lake Louise are two major towns in Banff National Park.
As the largest town in the park, Banff is ""Canada's Highest Town""
at 1384 meters (4540 feet) above sea level.
Lake Louise, with its blue-green water set against the stark backdrop of Victoria Glacier,
is the highest permanent settlement in Canada at 1,536 meters (5,039 feet) above the sea level
and probably the most beloved and most photographed scene in the Canadian Rockies.
In Banff National Park, driving through the Bow Valley Parkway,
one of the world's most scenic highways, is a good opportunity to see animals,
particularly deer, bears and moose.
Banff National Park is part of the UNESCO Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site.

207,207. Sport Canada,B2,207-sport-canada,31,"Sport Canada is the name of Canada's federal government program to help support athletes.
The purpose of Sport Canada is to develop and encourage sport, health, and exercise programs for all Canadians.
However, Sport Canada's main emphasis is on high-performance athletes
training for major international athletic competitions, such as the Olympic Games.
Sport Canada was created in the 1970s as a response to the perceived need to help athletes train and compete in international sport.
Before the 1970s, athletes wishing to train and compete in sport had to support themselves financially.
Athletes were either independently wealthy, or were supported by family or friends.
Unfortunately, many high-caliber athletes without such financial support
simply could not afford to train and compete in international competition.
Also, before the early 1970s almost all international sports events were amateur.
Amateur rules meant those receiving funds from government programs or corporations were breaking the rules of sport.
Athletes receiving money were disqualified from competition.
As a result, the amateur rules generally limited training and competition to those athletes who came from wealthier families.
Less fortunate athletes, many of whom likely would have performed well for Canada in international competitions,
simply could not afford to do so.
Sport Canada has been a role model for many government-run sport programs around the world.
With its central administrative offices in Canada's capital of Ottawa,
Sport Canada efficiently provides administrative, coaching, and financial help for athletes across the country.
Athletes can concentrate their efforts full-time on training and competition.
As a result, Canada's share of the medal totals in the Olympic Games has risen since the 1970s.
Recently, Sport Canada's programs have been criticized
by some who feel that the program does not provide enough money for athletes.
While it does provide financial assistance to athletes,
the amount paid is well below Canada's minimum wage.
Critics point out that athletes work full-time and perform an important function for the Canadian government and people.
As a result of this criticism, the Canadian government has provided more money for athletes.
However, the amount is still below the minimum wage level.
As a result, the amount paid to athletes is likely to rise in the future.
As long as it effectively manages problems such as funding,
Sport Canada will continue to provide the Canadian public with international-caliber athletes
who compete with the very best in the world.

The NHL provides Canadians and Americans with the highest caliber and most entertaining hockey on the continent.
The NHL was created in 1917 by a group of Canadian and American businessmen.
Their two central goals were to create a league that provided the most entertaining hockey in North America
and generated revenues and profits.
This was a somewhat new idea at the time.
While there were some for-profit leagues in existence, most were amateur.
This meant that players, coaches, and owners of teams were not allowed to make money from playing the game of hockey.
It took several decades for the NHL to become the most dominant league.
In the early days, a few professional or commercial leagues competed with the NHL for the public's entertainment dollar.
Leagues competed vigorously for the best players in order to be successful and attract spectators and fans.
While this was beneficial to players because they could command higher salaries,
it was bad for business because owners' expenses skyrocketed.
As a result, many teams and leagues went bankrupt.
By the 1930s, however, the NHL remained as the only major professional league in North America.
This effectively kept players' salaries down and reduced expenses.
The NHL's team owners realized that in order for the league to be a successful commercial business,
they would have to stop competing against each other off the ice.
This was best accomplished by ensuring that only one major league existed, so that competition was reduced.
To this day, the same business model is followed,
and the NHL is still the only major professional hockey league in North America.
For several decades in the mid twentieth century,
the NHL owners were extremely successful financially.
They generated very high profits because,
having a monopoly in the hockey market, they could limit the sale and trade of players.
When players signed on to a team, they generally did so for life,
and at the pay rate determined by the owner.
Players were forced to accept these conditions because there were no other leagues in existence.
This all changed in the 1970s when players organized to form a players' union.
Through the collective bargaining process, players gradually fought owners for higher pay and greater rights.
Today, many players are very wealthy for this reason.
If it was not for the players' union,
it is likely they would still be working in similar conditions to those during the early days of the NHL:
low pay and little freedom to move from team to team.
With NHL owners and players cooperating,
the NHL continues to be the most successful and entertaining hockey league in North America.
Teams across Canada and the United States compete for the prized Stanley Cup,
the most sought-after trophy in North American hockey.

209,209. ParticipACTION,B2,209-participaction,24,"""ParticipAction"" was the name of the Canadian government program designed to encourage Canadians to get and stay physically fit.
Created in 1971 by the federal government, ParticipAction was successful in encouraging Canadians to be active and to stay healthy.
ParticipAction was created by the Canadian Liberal government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
Trudeau believed that sport and recreation should play an important role in the lives of Canadian citizens.
His government took two steps towards the accomplishment of this goal.
First, a government agency was created to provide funds for high performance athletes,
such as those training and competing in the Olympic Games.
A second agency was created to encourage participaction and physical activity in the general Canadian population.
It was out of this second agency that ParticipAction was born.
ParticipAction became famous in the 1970s because of a series of television commercials.
In these commercials, a young Canadian in his 20's was seen being out-run by a 60-year-old Swedish man.
The message was that Canadians had become lazy and inactive.
This was probably true of Canadians at the time.
Physical fitness was not highly encouraged in schools, especially for women.
Also, the government played little role in encouraging physical activity before ParticipAction.
The result of ParticipAction was impressive.
Canadians became more active in the years following the program's inception.
Also, fitness and activity were encouraged through physical education programs.
ParticipAction was seen as a positive program
because it got Canadians active while reducing health care costs caused by inactivity and poor physical conditioning.
Recently, ParticipAction was terminated by the federal government because of a lack of funding.
Many people thought this was a shame given the positive messages the program gave to otherwise inactive Canadians.
Despite the program's termination, ParticipAction has made a long-lasting impression on Canadians.
Hopefully, its positive example of physical fitness for Canadians will continue in the future.

210,210. The Olympic Games,C1,210-the-olympic-games,31,"The modern Olympic Games began in the late nineteenth century as a revival of the ancient Greek Olympics.
Now just over 100 years old, the modern Olympic movement is the biggest and most important sports movement in the world.
In fact, many people believe the Olympic Games to be the most important cultural event of any kind in the world.
The modern Olympic Games were the brainchild of Frenchman Baron Pierre de Coubertin.
De Coubertin's dream for an international sports event and cultural movement became a reality in 1894
at the International Athletic Congress in Paris.
After the Games were constituted in 1894,
the first Olympic Games was held in Athens, Greece, in 1896,
in recognition of the ancient Greek Olympic Games.
The original purpose of the Olympic Games in de Coubertin's mind
was to celebrate and strengthen the physical, mental, and cultural qualities of humanity.
The Games would blend sport with culture, tradition, and education.
The philosophy of Olympism is based on the joy of physical and mental effort and the respect for universal ethical principles.
De Coubertin envisioned creating a more noble and sympathetic humanity through the Olympic movement.
The sports events themselves de Coubertin modeled after the English public school sport system.
He saw in upper-class English boys' sport the qualities of camaraderie, nobility, and honesty.
Most importantly, however, was adherence to the rules of sport,
in particular the rule that stated sport ought to be amateur in nature.
De Coubertin believed participants should never participate in sport for the purpose of making money.
To do so would contradict the underlying philosophy of sport.
Breaking the amateur rule in de Coubertin's time
was as serious a violation as taking drugs to enhance performance is in today's world of sport.
Over time, the Olympics grew to be the largest international festival of any kind.
Today, debates exist as to the degree to which the modern Games adhere to de Coubertin's original intent.
On the one hand, Olympic sport is truly international in nature,
as de Coubertin would have wanted it.
On the other hand, it is doubtful that de Coubertin would have admired the existence of politics,
commercialism, and drug use in sport.
The Olympics have become truly international, but perhaps at a price.
There is little question that the Olympic Games hold out the possibility for fulfilling De Coubertin's original goal
of sport contributing to a better, more peaceful, and understanding world.

211,211. Tiger Woods,C1,211-tiger-woods,40,"One of the most dramatic moments in golf occurred on April 13, 1997.
On that day, Eldrick ""Tiger"" Woods, at the young age of 21,
won the prestigious Masters golf tournament.
Not only was Woods the youngest ever to perform the feat,
Woods' score of 270 set a record for the tournament.
His victory was also seen by many as a symbolic victory over years of racism in the sport of golf,
and U.S society in general.
Woods' victory in 1997 came just two days after the fiftieth anniversary of the day American baseball players
broke the color barrier in professional baseball.
Also, Woods' victory came in a sport long recognized for racial exclusion.
The Augusta National Golf Club excluded blacks from playing in the Masters tournament until 1975,
and the Professional Golfers Association only removed its ""Caucasians only"" rule in 1961.
Woods was born in the state of Florida in 1975.
He rose to fame quickly, winning the US amateur tournament from 1994 to 1996,
National Collegiate Athletic Association champion in 1996,
and US Junior championship from 1991 to 1993.
In the first year that Woods turned professional,
it is estimated that over $650 million (U.S.) in extra revenue was generated in golf.
Television ratings soared in the sport,
and the Professional Golfers Association negotiated huge contracts
with American television networks as a result of Woods' fame.
Woods has also negotiated record-breaking private sponsorship deals with major firms such as Nike,
Buick, Titleist, American Express, and many others.
In fact, Woods negotiated deals in the millions even before he turned professional.
Truly an international sports celebrity,
Woods sees himself as someone destined not only to be a great athlete,
but also a person who will have some significant social or political impact on the world.
It is not clear, however, what that impact will be.
But there is little question that he will be one of the, if not the, richest athletes in history.
Woods is destined not just to be a multi-millionaire, but a billionaire.
Heralded by some as the first black champion in a traditionally racially secluded sport,
he has also been received more cautiously by those who see the limitations of using black sports stars as role models for youth.
Only a tiny fraction of African Americans have even a remote chance of becoming sports stars in any sport, especially golf.
The odds, in fact, are so small that there is a much greater chance of winning a lottery.
However, by some accounts as many as 80% of African American youth
aspire to make a living from playing sports.
Meanwhile, 45% of African American children live below the poverty line in the U.S.
If the trajectory of Woods' career continue on its current path,
it is possible he will satisfy his father's wishes for Tiger:
""to make an impact on the world, it will be spiritual and humanitarian and will transcend the world of golf"".

212,212. Nike,C1,212-nike,38,"Nike and its swoosh corporate symbol are among the most recognized brand names in the world,
alongside McDonalds, Coca-Cola, and Disney.
Starting in 1964 as a sport shoe outlet,
the company grew to become the market leader in footwear and apparel.
Nike has since diversified into a range of activities, including sports event promotion.
Owned by Phil Knight, Nike has become synonymous with world-class sport,
especially through its sponsorship of events and elite athletes such as Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods.
Nike is so ever-present in the sports consumers' minds,
that a survey conducted during the Atlanta Summer Olympic Games in 1996
revealed an extremely high awareness of Nike,
despite the fact that Nike was not an official sponsor of the Games.
Nike's success has, to a great extent, been due to the fact that the company and its swoosh symbol
have become ubiquitous in consumers' minds.
Nike has even run television commercials without even mentioning its own name,
being confident enough that the checkmark swoosh is more than enough to make the company known.
Phil Knight has been the main inspiration behind Nike and its corporate direction.
A competent, although not elite, middle distance runner at the University of Oregon,
Knight went onto Harvard business school where the Nike idea emerged out of a paper he developed for a class on entrepreneurship.
Knight's former coach, Bill Bowerman,
developed lightweight running shoes that became the new company's trademark in the early days.
From these modest beginnings, Nike eventually grew to become the sports giant it is today.
Ironically, part of Nike's status in the world of competitive sports merchandising
has come from the attention it's received by critics.
A short article published in the early 1990s in Harper's Magazine
quickly mushroomed into an international outcry against Nike's practice of placing their factories in underdeveloped countries
and paying workers below-subsistence wages.
Nike quickly responded to the criticisms with a number of tactics to either divert attention away from the criticisms
(ones that Knight, interestingly, at first denied),
or by acknowledging the practices but claiming Nike was ""cleaning up its act"".
In many cases, Nike has made an effort to create better working conditions for those in underdeveloped countries making shoes and other merchandise.
However, the overall effect of Nike's changes is not known,
and several groups around the world regularly check, and often criticize, Nike's labor practices.
Nike's recent marketing extravaganzas include a $200 million (U.S.) deal with the Brazilian National Soccer Federation.
It has been rumored that Knight's ego has much to do with Nike's marketing strategies.
Some critics have suggested that Knight's hidden agenda is no less than controlling sports marketing and merchandising throughout the world.
Nike's corporate headquarters in Oregon reflect these aspirations.
Nike's buildings and surrounding grounds are constructed very much like a religious cathedral,
only with elite athletes, and Knight himself, as the gods.

213,213. Bjorn Borg,B2,213-bjorn-borg,37,"The professional career of tennis player Bjorn Borg was one of the most interesting ones in recent sports history.
Borg's success in his sport came at an early age.
Borg won Wimbledon when he was only 20 years old.
However, by the time he was 26, and in the prime of his career,
Borg inexplicably retired from professional tennis.
Borg, who began playing tennis at the age of nine,
was the number one ranked junior player by the age of 14,
and had won the Italian and French Open titles at the age of 18.
These were the first of several major championships won by Borg in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Probably his greatest achievement was a winning streak at Wimbledon that spanned five years.
Between the years 1976 and 1982,
Borg enjoyed almost complete dominance in competitive tennis.
His retirement in 1983, then, was a bit of a puzzle.
Although his tennis skills waned somewhat in the previous year,
he was still one of the top players on the tour, and only 26 years old.
Even stranger was the fact that Borg refused to reveal the reasons for his retirement.
Following his retirement, Borg encountered a number of personal problems,
which kept him in the media spotlight even though he was no longer playing competitive tennis.
Five years after his retirement, an emergency hospital procedure saved his life.
While Borg claimed he had food poisoning, it was suspected he had a barbiturate overdose.
In 1991, Borg attempted to make a comeback on the professional tennis tour, only to fail miserably.
His insistence on using a wooden racket at the time,
when all of the world's top players were using synthetic fiber rackets, didn't help matters.
At the same time, Borg's second wife attempted to commit suicide,
and the couple divorced in 1993.
Eventually, Borg disappeared into obscurity, and there is little news of his life today.
These sad stories about the latter part of his career aside,
Borg was an important figure in modern tennis history.
He was the sport's first modern media star and icon.
Teenage girls conferred upon him a status comparable to a rock star.
His face adorned t-shirts and other merchandise,
making him the most marketable tennis player in history.
Borg's career was a catalyst for Swedish tennis players.
Those who followed in his footsteps and held him up as their hero
included tennis stars Mats Wilander and Stephan Edberg.
Perhaps most important of all, Borg gave to the sport of tennis a degree of showmanship,
visibility, and marketability that was used as a role model for the sport in future decades.

214,214. Babe Didrikson,C1,214-babe-didrikson,31,"Mildred ""Babe"" Didrikson (1913-1956)
was one of the most celebrated female athletes of the first half of the 20th century.
Competing in the 1930s and 1940s, when conventional attitudes regarding women's participation in sport dominated North American culture,
Babe Didrikson rose to fame by dominating not just one, but a number of sports.
Didrikson flouted conventional notions of femininity and ""proper"" female activity
by excelling in field events such as javelin and shot-put,
in addition to traditionally male, dominated sports such as baseball, swimming, and golf.
Interestingly, Didrikson would always have to battle popular accounts that attacked or questioned her femininity and sexuality.
As a woman with a large, muscular and athletic body,
Didrikson was often accused of having an ""unfair advantage"" over other women,
and often regarded as not being a ""real woman"".
Born in the state of Texas, Didrikson rose to athletic fame quickly,
representing the U.S.A. in the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles
where she won and set records in the javelin and 80 metre hurdles.
Later in her career, Didrikson turned her athletic attention mainly to golf,
a sport in which she was immensely successful.
Interestingly, however, Didrikson tired of the popular innuendo regarding her ""unfeminine"" appearance
and made a conscious effort to change her image in favor of a more traditionally feminine one:
she donned dresses and make-up in place of her sweat pants and makeupless appearance.
Didrikson's controversial career underwent a twist when she fought the American Athletic Union (AAU),
which had stripped her of her amateur sports status after she allowed her image to be used in endorsements for cars.
When offered amateur status reinstatement, Didrikson refused,
challenging what she believed to be the AAU's antiquated rules and regulations.
Aside from her incredible athletic accomplishments,
Didrikson is an important historical figure because of the challenge she made to the male-dominated institution of sport.
Didrikson challenged those within the institution of sport to question gender values
at a time when the political environment made it difficult to do so.
Didrikson prefigured by several decades the challenges to sport made by other female athletes
such as Billie Jean King, Martine Navratilova, and Florence Griffith Joyner.
Didrikson forced a re-examination of the meaning of sports,
making many aware of the social and political importance of an institution typically not thought of as such.

215,215. Michael Jordan,C1,215-michael-jordan,41,"Michael Jordan is one of the most recognized sports figures in the world.
To understand the breadth of his fame, it's probably best to think of Jordan in two senses:
as a person and an athlete with incredible athletic prowess and skill,
and as a cultural and media icon.
The second way of thinking about Jordan is probably equal to the first.
After all, it was his endorsement of dozens of commercial products, spots in movies,
and in general his commercially and market-produced image that made Jordan so famous worldwide.
Jordan was born in 1963, one of three sons of a corporate executive.
He attended North Carolina University from 1981 to 84,
and was then drafted to the National Basketball Association's (NBA) Chicago Bulls.
During the same year,
he co-captained the U.S.A. basketball team to gold in the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
Jordan's fame was quickly accelerated with the help of his agent and a marketing firm.
After winning the NBA's Rookie of the Year distinction,
Jordan quickly began signing a series of marketing contracts
that would eventually create the iconic image known throughout the world.
The most notable marketing endorsement contract came with Nike Corporation.
Nike built much of its marketing and commercial strategy around Jordan in the 1980s and early 1990s.
With his own line of Nike-produced basketball shoes and clothing,
Jordan established himself as a marketable commodity.
The relationship between Nike and Jordan would be a mutually beneficial one.
It elevated Jordan to international prominence,
while helping push Nike to number one status as world sports merchandiser.
Jordan's athletic status was also aided by the fact
that his was a career with relatively little controversy, unlike many other superstar athletes.
Social and political controversies surrounding Jordan were rare,
and when they did occur these were minor.
In 1992, he got himself into a bit of trouble
when he did not allow his image to be used by the NBA
for the licensing of leisure wear and memorabilia in the run-up to the Summer Olympic Games.
In addition, once at the Games, Jordan, being contractually committed to Nike,
refused to wear the official sponsor Reebok's warm-up suits.
The issue was resolved when Jordan and his teammates wore the U.S. flag
and extra long lapels to cover the Reebok logo.
In 1993, Jordan made a surprise announcement of his retirement from the NBA at the age of thirty.
He signed as a free agent to play Major League Baseball with the Chicago White Sox,
and played unsuccessfully, as it turned out, with the White Sox minor league affiliate.
Jordan then made a brief comeback in the NBA, only to retire soon after.
History will recognize Jordan not only for his athletic prowess,
arguably the best the sport of basketball has ever seen,
and for his iconic status in the later-twentieth century world of sport's marketing and image production.

216,216. New Zealand,B1,216-new-zealand,41,"New Zealand is a country that is located in the South Pacific ocean.
The country is made up of two large islands,
the North Island and the South Island,
which are separated by a narrow channel of water.
Although New Zealand has many beautiful mountains and forests,
much of the land is used for farming.
In fact, New Zealand has almost 70 million sheep, but only 4 million people!
New Zealand's farms are also famous for their delicious fruit, especially apples and kiwi fruit.
About 10% of the people who live in New Zealand belong to an ethnic group called the Maori.
The Maori came to New Zealand by boats from small Polynesian islands.
They arrived about 1000 years ago,
and lived by farming, hunting, and fishing.
About 200 years ago, many more people came to New Zealand.
These people were from the British Isles,
and they came to New Zealand to begin farms.
Today, most of the people of New Zealand are descended from people who came from Britain.
During the 19th century, some wars started between the Maori and the British settlers.
After years of fighting, the two sides signed a treaty to end the wars.
Today the Maori have achieved equal rights,
but there are still some disagreements about land ownership.
In recent years, many more people have come to New Zealand,
mostly from Asian countries and from other Pacific Islands.
There are three large cities in New Zealand.
Auckland is the largest city, with more than 1 million people.
It is located in the northern part of North Island.
The capital city of New Zealand is Wellington.
It is located in the southern part of the North Island.
The largest city of the South Island is Christchurch.
The cities of New Zealand are very modern and clean.
Many tourists enjoy visiting the cities of New Zealand,
but they also enjoy the beautiful countryside.
New Zealand is an excellent place for outdoor recreation, such as climbing or walking.
Most of New Zealand has a mild, or temperate, climate.
The summer is not very hot, and the winter is not very cold.
Because New Zealand is in the southern part of the world,
summer begins in December and winter begins in June.
The South Island is cooler than the North Island,
but both islands have similar amounts of rain.
This rain gives the fields and forests of New Zealand a beautiful green colour.
Each year, many tourists visit New Zealand,
to experience the beautiful countryside and the interesting cultures of its people.

217,217. Thomas Edison,B1,217-thomas-edison,33,"Thomas Edison was one of the most famous inventors of all time.
He was born in a small town in the United States during the year 1847.
When he was a young boy, Thomas found school to be very boring.
A teacher once told Thomas's mother that he believed the young boy was rather stupid.
However, Edison's mother knew better.
She understood that her son was very intelligent.
She then took him away from school and began to teach him herself.
As a young man, Thomas Edison became very interested in inventing new machines.
One of his first inventions was a small electrical machine that could be used for counting votes.
However, the government was not interested in his invention.
But Edison was not discouraged. He continued inventing,
and his next invention was an electrical machine that could be used for recording the prices of stock.
This invention was very popular and successful.
Probably the most famous invention of Edison is the electric light bulb.
Before Edison, there had been some electric lights, but these were very expensive.
In 1879, Edison invented a new kind of light bulb that could shine for a long time.
Within a few years, Edison's electric lights were used on the streets of cities in many countries.
Soon after, people began using electric lights in their homes.
Another invention of Edison's is no longer used today.
That invention was called the phonograph.
It was a machine that could be used to record sounds, such as music and conversation.
When Edison invented this machine, in 1877,
it was the first time that anyone had been able to preserve sounds.
Today, people do not use the phonograph any more.
Instead, they use compact discs (or CDs) to record music and other sounds.
Edison also helped to improve some inventions that already existed.
For example, he made improvements to the telephone and to the cameras that are used in making movies.
However, Edison is most famous for his inventions, such as the light bulb and the phonograph.
Edison lived to an old age, and he died in 1931.
Although Edison was an extremely creative man,
he believed that his success was due to many hours of hard work.
He once said that ""Genius is 1% inspiration, and 99% perspiration"".
In other words, a successful person should have good ideas, but the most important thing is to work very hard.

218,218. Come to the fair,B2,218-come-to-the-fair,52,"Fall fairs have been a feature of North American life since early in the nineteenth century.
At the end of the harvest, people from rural areas have come together to celebrate.
Usually, these fairs take the form of a competition regarding the best of all farm products of that year.
Depending on the part of the country, and its most important crop,
fall fairs can begin as early as August or as late as November.
They usually last several days.
When the United States and Canada were organized, they were divided into small units called counties.
Larger units were called states or provinces.
Many of the best-known fairs are county fairs or state fairs.
There are also smaller local fairs,
and larger ones too, like the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Ontario.
Since these fairs are usually annual events,
many have developed permanent buildings over the years.
Most of these are large barn-like structures.
These buildings are used to display new products for farm life,
such as tractors, home furnishings and water systems.
Several barns are usually necessary to house all the horses,
cows, pigs, goats, sheep, chickens and other animals in competition.
There must also be room to display all the vegetables, berries and fruits in competition.
Finally, there is space for handicrafts, artwork, baked goods, and jams and jellies.
Usually, there is a grandstand, which is a stage with wooden seats around it.
Here entertainers perform for an audience during the fair.
Country and western singers are usually popular at fairs,
but so are comedians, clowns, dancers and musicians.
There may also be other contests such as a beauty competition for queen of the fair,
tests of strength for the men or pie-eating events.
Most fairs also have a racetrack, which is used for horse racing, or, in some cases, auto-racing.
Fairs have helped to improve animal breeds, and races encourage the breeding of fast horses.
Ploughing contests test the strength and steadiness of horses, and so do pulling contests.
This spirit of competition has led to improvements in all areas of farming.
Every kind of grain, fruit, vegetable, berry and animal is tested, and only the best win a ribbon.
This encourages fairness to improve their products.
Farm women compete to produce the best homemade food and crafts.
Many kinds of fruit and vegetables are stored in glass jars for the winter.
The best of these also receive prizes.
Most fairs have a dining area where there is good food served to the public.
The goal of improving farming is sponsored by the governments of Canada and the U.S.A.
Four-H Clubs are youth organizations that encourage farm children to take an interest in farming.
Four-H Clubs aim at improving the heads, hearts, hands and health of their members.
There are also women's organizations, such as the Women's Institutes in Canada,
which work to make the life of farm families better.
Fall fairs have taken over the idea of the midway from the circus.
The midway has rides like Ferris wheels, merry-go-rounds, and roller coasters.
It also has games of chance and skill, such as trying to throw a small hoop over a large bottle.
One nice thing about fall fairs is that they are fun for the whole family.
Children enjoy the midway and the farm animals.
Women like the crafts, food and household exhibits.
Men like the machinery, the horse races and the crop exhibits.
Everyone likes the grandstand shows.
Nowadays, not so many people live on farms.
But people from towns and cities still enjoy going to fall fairs.
They are part of our North American heritage.

219,219. Hiroshima,B2,219-hiroshima,43,"North American children know about Hiroshima.
They are taught about the dangers of nuclear war.
Sometimes they learn the details of the damage that was done.
They learn about what happened at 8:15 am on August 6, 1945.
People were eating breakfast, children were going to school and adults going to work.
There was a blinding flash of light, a scorching heat, and a mushroom cloud rose up.
People close to the explosion were instantly vaporized.
Many of those further away would die from burns and radiation.
Sixty thousand houses were destroyed immediately.
One concrete structure remained standing, although it was damaged.
The local government left the Atomic Dome standing as a memorial to the explosion.
Even those who were not seriously injured in the explosion later became very ill.
They became very sick from radiation poisoning.
Many developed leukemia.
Sadako Sasaki was two years old when the bomb exploded.
She was apparently uninjured and grew up normally until she was twelve.
Then she developed leukemia - a disease of the blood and bone marrow.
Sadako began to fold paper cranes to protect her from the illness.
However, she died in 1955 before she reached one thousand paper cranes.
Her example inspired the Children's Monument at Hiroshima.
There is a Peace Museum in Hiroshima which has objects left by the explosion.
These include bottles, metal, stones and tiles twisted into strange shapes by the heat.
There are objects on which people were vaporized, so that their shape appears like a shadow on the material.
There are bits of burnt clothing and many photographs.
Why was the bomb dropped?
World War II was a long and bitter war.
The rules of war, which said not to kill civilians, were forgotten.
Hitler bombed London, hoping to break the spirit of the English.
Then England bombed Germany to destroy the factories and kill the people who worked in them.
Americans wanted revenge for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
The U.S. government had spent $6 billion developing the A-bomb and wanted to use it.
Some say that they also wanted to warn the Russians not to cause trouble for America.
When American forces advanced on Japan in 1945, they had to decide what to do.
Would Japan surrender, or would they fight to the last soldier?
American leaders feared that they might lose many men by an invasion.
Dropping the atomic bomb would end the war very quickly.
President Truman made the decision to use it.
Since then, most people have felt that this decision was wrong.
It was such a terrible thing to do to people - children, old people, women, men and babies.
Hiroshima inspired many people to try to ""ban the bomb"".
They wanted to ensure that atomic bombs would not be used again.
Even some of the scientists and aircrews involved in making and dropping the bomb at Hiroshima wanted it banned.
Perhaps if we can all remember what happened that day, there will be no more Hiroshimas.

220,220. Niagara Falls,B2,220-niagara-falls,43,"Niagara Falls is one of the world's leading tourist attractions.
Millions of people around the world visit here each year.
Summers at the Falls are especially busy, with traffic jams and parking problems.
However, the Falls are beautiful in winter too.
Many have asked why people travel so far to see water falling over a cliff.
The size and beauty of Niagara Falls help to make it special.
While many falls are higher than Niagara, very few are as wide or have such a volume of water.
It also helps that Niagara is relatively easy to travel to.
When the first Europeans came to Niagara, the Falls were surrounded by forest.
The noise of the Falls could be heard miles away, before they were actually seen.
The first visitors were filled with horror at the sight.
Later, fear ceased to be the main emotion inspired by the Falls.
Later, visitors were impressed by the beauty and grandeur of the Falls, which overwhelmed them with wonder.
By the 1830s, people were able to come to the Falls by railway.
As more and more people came, the tourist industry developed.
Early tourism was not well regulated, and there were many complaints about cheats and swindles.
Today, there are similar complaints about tourist junk and high prices.
The majority of tourists stay on the Canadian side.
There are two falls, separated by an island.
Since the Niagara River forms the boundary here between Canada and the United States,
each country has one of the falls.
The Canadian Horseshoe Falls is wider and more impressive than the American Rainbow Falls.
About nine times more water goes over the Canadian Falls.
Nonetheless, there is much to be seen on the American side.
The island in the middle, Goat Island, is one of the best places to view the falls and rapids.
It is on the American side.
Newly married couples began coming to Niagara Falls when it was still a secluded, peaceful and romantic spot.
It is still popular with newly-weds as a relatively inexpensive and convenient place to spend their honeymoon.
Besides being beautiful, Niagara Falls is also very useful.
Their falling water is the power behind several of the largest hydroelectric stations in the world.
Much of the electric power used in this part of North America comes from Niagara Falls.
In order to harness this power,
half of the flow of water is channeled away from the falls during the night,
and during the non-tourist season.
Probably most visitors don't notice the difference.
Niagara has attracted many kinds of people over the years.
Businessmen have come to profit from the tourists.
Daredevils have come to make a name for themselves.
Some have gone over the falls in a barrel,
while others have walked above the falls on a tightrope.
Poets and artists have visited here to capture its beauty.
Lovers have come to gaze on its romantic scenery.
All of these, and many others, have helped to make Niagara Falls world famous.

221,221. Cowboys,B2,221-cowboys,47,"The Golden Age of the American cowboy was short lived.
It began in the 1860s with the great cattle drives from Texas north to Kansas.
By 1890, when railroads had reached remote areas,
there was no more need for large-scale cattle drives.
Of course, cowboys have a history before 1860.
In fact, there were Mexican cowboys long before that.
The Spanish conqueror of Mexico, Hernan Cortes, brought cattle with him in 1521.
Cortes also branded his cattle with a three cross design.
The Spanish sharp-horned cattle roamed the deserts and prairies freely.
Eventually, they found their way to Texas.
American settlers in Texas interbred their animals with the Spanish breed,
the Texas longhorn cow was the result!
It was famous for its bad temper and aggressiveness.
The Longhorn was a dangerous animal,
with each of its horns measuring up to 3.5 feet long.
After the American Civil War ended in 1865,
disbanded soldiers, who were former black slaves, and young men seeking adventure headed west.
At that time, there were about five million cattle in Texas.
Back in the East, there was a big demand for beef.
By this time, railways from the east extended as far west as Kansas.
It was still more than 600 miles from South Texas to the railway.
Between the two places there were rivers to cross,
Indian tribes, badlands and other problems.
A fur trader named Jesse Chisholm had driven his wagon north in 1865.
Cowboys and cattle followed the Chisholm Trail north to Abilene, Kansas.
This cattle trail became the most famous route for driving cattle,
until it was barred with barbed wire in 1884.
In 1867, cattle dealer Joseph G. McCoy built pens for 3,000 cattle in the little town of Abilene.
Soon Abilene was the most dangerous town in America.
After the long cattle drive, cowboys who had just been paid went wild.
Sheriff ""Wild Bill"" Hickok tamed Abilene in 1871
by forcing cowboys to turn over their guns when they arrived in town.
Other towns replaced Abilene as the wildest town in the West
Newton, Wichita, Ellsworth and Dodge City.
In Kansas a herd of 3,000 Texas longhorns might sell for $100,000 making the rancher rich.
The cowboys might get $200 in wages, which often disappeared on drink, women and gambling.
Getting cattle to Kansas was far from easy.
One of the biggest difficulties was getting the herd across rivers, especially when the river was high.
There were no bridges.
In 1871, 350 cowboys driving 60,000 cattle waited two weeks for the water level in the Red River to go down.
Food for men and animals was also difficult to find at times.
An early cattleman developed the chuck wagon,
which were both a supply wagon and a portable kitchen.
In the 1870s, there were probably 40,000 cowboys in the West.
After the prairies were fenced in, there was less work.
Large ranches still employ cowboys to round up the cattle for branding or for sale.
Even today, about 20,000 cowboys still work in North America.

222,222. George W. Bush Jr.,B2,222-george-w-bush-jr,45,"George W. Bush Jr. was inaugurated as the 43rd President of the United States on January 20 2001.
Of course, people knew that he was the son of the 41st President, George H. W. Bush.
He had also been Governor of Texas since 1994.
However, aside from this, he was not very well known outside of Texas.
Why then did so many people want him to run for president in 2000?
Many republicans thought that the democrats could be defeated in 2000.
But they themselves lacked a candidate with strong appeal.
As the election approached, leading republicans worried about whom to support.
Some of the most powerful republicans were state governors.
They began to look around at each other for a possible candidate.
Most eyes turned to George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas.
In November 1998, Bush was re-elected as Governor by an impressive margin.
By now, Bush was the leading republican candidate in the polls.
Of course, one advantage that Governor Bush had was a familiar name.
In fact, when he did well in some early polls, it is likely that some people really voted for his father.
They thought that George H. W. Bush was running again.
The Bush family was able to swing a lot of support to George W.
It also helped that his brother, Jeb, was now Governor of Florida.
Parents George and Barbara were both born in eastern United States.
But in 1948, George moved to Texas where he made a fortune in the oil business.
He went into politics in the 1960s and 70s and served in a number of important positions.
He was Ronald Reagan's Vice President from 1981 to 1989,
and President from 1989 to 1993.
George W. was born in 1946, the oldest of the Bush children.
Three more brothers and two sisters were also born.
The youngest sister died of leukemia as a child.
George W. attended the same prestigious eastern colleges as his father.
Then he came back to Texas and was a fighter pilot with the Texas Air National Guard.
During the early '70s he wandered from place to place, trying different jobs.
After attending Harvard Business School from 1972 to 1975,
he came back to Texas and started his own oil exploration company.
Although it wasn't as profitable as his father's company,
he eventually sold his stock shares for a considerable amount of money.
In 1978, he ran for the Senate of the United States but was defeated.
He became closely involved in his father's campaign for president in 1988.
Here he developed a lot of the political skills he was later able to use to run for office himself.
In 1989, back in Texas, George W. organized a group that bought the Texas Rangers baseball team.
He later sold the team in 1998 and made a $14 million profit.
In 1994, he surprised the political world by defeating the incumbent Governor of Texas.
As Governor, he pushed ahead with an energetic program,
which reflected neo-conservative values.
However, George W. did not appear as an ideologist to people.
Even his opponents were willing to work with him.
When he ran for president in 2000, Bush described himself as a ""compassionate conservative"".
Only time will tell how successful Bush will be as U.S. President.

223,223. Handel's Messiah,B2,223-handels-messiah,42,"George Frederick Handel was a native of Germany and spoke with a German accent all his life.
Most of that life, however, was spent in London, England.
As a young musician, Handel's sponsor was the Elector of Hanover.
Later on, when the Elector became King George I of England, he continued to sponsor Handel.
The young Handel went to Italy to study opera.
Opera had become a very fashionable entertainment for the upper classes.
Handel traveled to England in 1711 and made an immediate success with his operas.
Queen Anne granted him a royal pension for life in 1713.
Because of this initial success, Handel tried to start a permanent opera company in London.
But this failed and Handel lost money.
Since operas used full stage settings with costumes, scenery and props, they were expensive to produce.
Handel decided to produce oratorios in which the parts were simply sung without actions.
On August 22, 1741,
Handel began to work on his oratorio ""The Messiah"".
The text was made up of passages from the Bible relating to the birth, life and death of Jesus.
Handel worked on it feverishly, missing meals and going without sleep.
He finished it 24 days later.
When he was asked how he felt on completing it, Handel said,
""I thought I saw all Heaven before me, and the great God Himself"".
In the fall of 1741,
Handel received an invitation from the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to present operas and concerts there.
Handel traveled from London to Dublin with his entire luggage and many of his singers.
However, in order to rehearse on the way, he had to hire local people to fill in.
Once, the composer soundly criticized one local singer who failed to meet his standards.
Handel was warmly received in Dublin, where his concerts were sold out.
Even his rehearsals were considered newsworthy by the local papers.
""The Messiah"" was first publicly performed on April 13, 1742.
Seven hundred people squeezed into a 600-seat theatre to hear it.
A notice had requested that ladies attend in hoopless skirts,
and that gentlemen come without their swords.
A Dublin paper reported,
""Words are wanting to express the exquisite delight it afforded to the admiring crowded audience"".
All proceeds were donated to charity, as the church choirs had refused to participate except on those conditions.
Handel returned to London in August 1742
and prepared the oratorio for the London stage.
""The Messiah"" made its London debut on March 23, 1743, with King George II in the audience.
It was during the Hallelujah Chorus that the King jumped to his feet and so initiated a tradition that has lasted ever since.
With such oratories, Handel was able to re-establish his popularity and restore his finances in London.
""The Messiah"" continued to be performed. After conducting it on April 6, 1759,
the old composer collapsed and had to be carried home. He died eight days later.
""The Messiah"" remains Handel's most popular work, combining wonderful music with inspiring religious sentiments.
The Biblical text speaks of hope and salvation, and the music allows the text to soar into angelic songs.

224,224. Ireland,B2,224-ireland,42,"Ireland is an island in the Atlantic Ocean just west of Britain.
For much of its history, it has been an advantage to Ireland to be far from the mainland.
The Romans or the other early Empires never conquered Ireland.
It was the remoteness of Ireland that helped preserve much of Christian and classical culture.
After the fall of the Roman Empire, wandering tribes destroyed much of what remained on the continent.
Finally, it was Ireland's turn to be invaded.
First, the Norsemen or Vikings attacked during the 800s and 900s.
Then in the 1100s, the English invaded Ireland.
Since that time, there has always been an English presence in Ireland.
The conflict between the English and the Irish grew worse in the 1500s.
Then the English became Protestant, and the Irish remained Catholic.
In the 1600s, Oliver Cromwell tried to make Ireland Protestant by driving out the Catholics and bringing in Protestant settlers.
In the centuries following, Irish Catholics had very few rights in their own country.
The Catholic Irish were not allowed to vote until 1829.
Since Irish Catholics were not allowed to own land,
they were poor tenant farmers.
They paid rent to the English landlords.
The main food crop in the 1840s was potatoes.
When these became infected by blight, thousands of Irishmen starved.
Many others were evicted from their dwellings because they couldn't pay the rent.
Hundreds of thousands of Irish took ship for North America.
The Catholic Irish preferred to go to the United States because Canada was under British influence.
However, many Protestant Irish went to Canada.
The influence of the Irish on North American culture has been very great in many areas.
Prominent Irish-Americans include Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.
Meanwhile, in Ireland itself, a strong independence movement developed.
A rebellion against England in 1916 began a struggle that resulted in independence for most of Ireland.
Some Protestant areas in Northern Ireland preferred to stay with England.
Republican groups such as the Irish Republican Army wanted to ""liberate"" the north from British rule.
Nowadays, conflict between Protestants and Catholics is limited to these northern counties.
Constant attempts are being made to bring the conflict there to an end.
Meanwhile, the Irish Republic, or Eire, has become prosperous again.
It can sell its agricultural products to the European Common Market.
Irish beer and whisky are sold all over the world.
Ireland is also becoming known for its high-tech industries.
Because of this relative prosperity, the population is increasing again,
after a century and a half of decline.
The Irish differ from other people because the vast majority of Irishmen live away from their homeland.
However, this exodus from Ireland has helped to spread Irish music, culture and products around the world.
On St. Patrick's Day (March 17th), nearly everyone becomes Irish for the day.
Then there is a great party with Celtic music,
Irish dancing, green beer and the wearing of the green.

225,225. Louisa May Alcott,B2,225-louisa-may-alcott,55,"New England in the early and middle years of the nineteenth century had a flourishing culture.
People were passionately interested in ideas and education.
Most New Englanders were strongly opposed to slavery.
They were also concerned about other social issues.
New ideas resulted in new kinds of writing.
These ideas included the importance of doing what seemed right for them,
no matter how different it was from what other people thought.
People also believed that nature gave them guidance in our lives
and that it was important to live close to nature.
These and other ideas were expressed through teaching and writing.
Bronson Alcott was one of those who looked at the world in a new way.
He looked for work as a teacher so that he could pass on his ideas to others.
However, very few parents wanted Mr. Alcott to teach their children.
And very few people were interested in hearing his speeches or reading his books.
As a result, the Alcott family was very poor.
Fortunately for Bronson, he married a very capable and energetic woman.
Mrs. Abigail Alcott helped to earn money to support the family
and did most of the work involved in looking after the four Alcott girls.
The oldest daughter, Anna, was quiet and serious.
She rarely got into trouble and was a good helper at home.
The second daughter was Louisa May Alcott, who became a writer.
She was adventurous and cared very little for rules.
She was always saying and doing things that got her into trouble.
The third daughter, Elizabeth, was very kind and good-natured.
All the others loved her.
As a young woman, Elizabeth had a severe case of scarlet fever and never fully recovered.
She died at age 23.
The youngest sister, May, was talented, but she was rather spoiled.
Because there was never enough money, the Alcott girls felt pressure to work at an early age.
But this did not stop them from having fun.
Louisa wrote little plays that she and her sisters performed at home.
They all enjoyed the woods and ponds around Concord, Massachusetts,
where they lived most of these years.
When they moved back to Boston in 1848,
Anna took a job looking after other people's children,
and Louisa looked after the house.
Meanwhile, their mother worked outside the home.
While working on laundry or sewing, Louisa was thinking up stories.
At night she would write them down.
When she was eighteen, she began selling poems and stories to magazines.
Within ten years, Louisa was earning a substantial income from writing.
One day her publisher suggested that she write a story for girls.
At first Louisa didn't like the suggestion.
But when she started to write, the ideas came rapidly.
Her book was based on her own family and her own childhood.
""Little Women"" was published in 1868 and was an immediate success.
The March family was very much like the Alcotts.
Mrs. Alcott resembles ""Marmee"".
""Meg"" is like Anna, and ""Jo"" is like Louisa herself.
""Beth"" is based on Elizabeth and ""Amy"" on May Alcott.
Many of the situations in the book happened to the Alcott family.
Nonetheless, many characters and incidents were invented.
""Little Women"" and its sequel opened up a new kind of writing for children.
While these books did have a moral, they were more lively and interesting than earlier children's writing.
""Little Women"" inspired many writers later to write more realistic accounts of childhood.

226,226. Niagara-on-the-Lake,B1,226-niagara-on-the-lake,44,"Niagara-on-the-Lake is a little town at the mouth of the Niagara River.
It is only twelve miles north of Niagara Falls.
It used to be true that very few tourists would bother to travel from the Falls down to Niagara-on-the-Lake.
Nowadays, however, the little town itself is a major tourist attraction.
The town has a remarkable history.
The area played an important role in both the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.
As a result, the little town has two forts, Fort George and Fort Mississauga.
When Fort George was reconstructed for the public in the 1930s,
Niagara-on-the-Lake got its first big tourist attraction.
Because Niagara-on-the-Lake was the first capital of Ontario, it has many significant ""firsts"".
There was the first parliament in the province, the first legal society,
the first library, the first newspaper,
the first museum building, and many more ""firsts"".
Besides its history, the town, which is bordered by Lake Ontario and the Niagara River, has beautiful scenery.
On a summer's day, visitors can watch the sailboats going out the river to the lake.
On the landside, Niagara is part of the fruit belt of Ontario.
Peaches, pears, apples, cherries and strawberries grow here in abundance.
There are also long rows of vines, and winemaking has recently become a major industry.
The mild humid climate allows plants to flourish.
The trees, especially the oaks, grow to remarkable heights.
Flowering trees and shrubs perfume the air in the spring.
Gardens are often spectacular for much of the year.
Because of this, Niagara-on-the-Lake attracts many painters and photographers.
Many of the private homes also have a long history, and great care is taken to keep them looking their best.
The biggest single attraction is the Shaw Festival Theatre.
The Festival was founded in 1962 by a group of Shaw enthusiasts.
Early productions were often held in the historic Court House on the main street, and plays still take place there.
In 1973, however, a new 861 seat Shaw Theatre was built at the south end of town.
Since then, traffic to Niagara-on-the-Lake has been steady all through the long summer season.
In 1996, Niagara-on-the-Lake was voted ""the prettiest town in Canada"".
Partly, it is the scale of things that makes the old town so attractive.
The old town is only about eight blocks long by eight blocks wide.
It has a population of little more than 1,000 people.
Nonetheless, there is a lot for people to do and see.
There are many interesting shops, old hotels, bookstores,
art galleries, museums, a golf course, a marina,
historic churches and cemeteries,
several parks, three theaters and lots of restaurants.
Because it is small, Niagara-on-the-Lake is a good place to walk around or bicycle around.
There are also horse and wagon rides.
Although the main street can be hectic in tourist season,
one doesn't have to go far off the main street to get in touch with an older slower time.
Most of the downtown buildings haven't changed much since the days of Queen Victoria,
and tourists can still imagine that they are back in the days before computers and television.

227,227. Newspapers,B2,227-newspapers,47,"All the great cities in the world now have newspapers.
But newspapers, as we know them today, are not that old.
The very first newspapers began long after the invention of printing.
They started in Europe in the 1600s, and were usually only a couple of pages long.
For a long time, newspapers were not very common.
Governments didn't want public discussion of their policies and decisions.
Often they closed down papers, or taxed them heavily.
The ""Stamp Tax"" on newspapers and pamphlets was one of the causes of the American Revolution.
Newspapers began to grow in size when they discovered advertising as a source of income.
Nowadays, advertising is the main revenue source for most newspapers.
As newspapers became more widely circulated, they could ask for more money for their advertisements.
By the late eighteenth century, newspapers were in common use in Europe.
The 1800s and early 1900s was the golden age of newspapers.
Improvements in transportation, communication and printing processes made it easier to collect news from near and far
and to publish papers more quickly and more cheaply.
The Weekly Dispatch and the Times, both of London, England,
were leading newspapers through much of the 1800s.
The Times was one of the first papers to include illustrations.
It was the first newspaper to use a steam engine to turn the presses.
When the tax on newspapers was reduced in 1836,
the Times was able to increase its size considerably.
In 1840, it began to use the telegraph to collect news stories.
In 1855 the tax on newspapers was finally lifted.
The Times made its greatest reputation during the Crimean War between Britain and Russia.
British armies, fighting in Russia's Crimean Peninsula, were not only unsuccessful in the war,
but were suffering severely from illnesses.
The Times sent out the world's first war correspondent,
William Howard Russell, in 1854.
His reports from the battle lines had a powerful effect on the British public.
A War Fund was organized to help the soldiers.
Russell forced the government to accept the offer of Florence Nightingale to organize nurses to travel to Crimea.
A photographer, Roger Fenton, sent back photos from the war, which were published in the Times.
Meanwhile in America, a more popular approach to newspapers had developed.
The newspaper had spread west with the pioneers, and nearly every little settlement had its own paper.
American newspapers were cheaper and livelier than British ones.
They were aimed at the average person, rather than the governing class.
Examples of the new style of editing and publishing were Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst.
Hearst, especially, employed sensational and emotional writing, which aimed at stirring up the public to action.
Hearst is sometimes accused of starting the Spanish-American War of 1898 with his over-heated editorials.
Nonetheless, his methods were successful in raising circulation and were widely imitated.
The modern newspaper contains more than hard news.
In fact, news may be a fairly small part of it.
Advertisements, gossip, show business,
photos of celebrities, sports, stock market prices, horoscopes,
comic strips, weather reports and much more are found in its pages.
The modern newspaper is a total entertainment package.
A question for the future is whether electronic newspapers will replace paper newspapers.

228,228. Paul Kane Frontier Artist,B2,228-paul-kane-frontier-artist,59,"Since Christopher Columbus first met American Indians in 1492,
many Europeans had been fascinated by Indian life and culture.
As a result, there was a demand in Europe for drawings and paintings of Native Americans.
European artists who had never seen an Indian supplied most of this demand.
But in the nineteenth century, several painters traveled into Indian Territory to make an authentic record of native life.
One of the first artists to do this was the American painter George Catlin.
In 1841, Catlin published a book of his work.
Catlin's work helped inspire another important frontier artist, the Canadian Paul Kane.
Paul Kane was born in Ireland in 1810.
His family moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, when Paul was nine years old.
The young boy was not very interested in school.
At that time, there were still Indians living in wigwams in the Toronto area.
Young Paul liked visiting the Indian village instead of going to school.
Since Paul spent little time in school, he was largely a self-taught artist.
He also became a surprisingly good writer,
considering that he had not spent much time studying spelling or grammar.
After working some years making and decorating furniture, Kane was ready to travel.
He spent the years from 1836 to 1841 living and traveling in the United States.
Then he traveled in Europe from 1841 to 1843, studying the great painters of the past.
He was back in the U.S.A. until 1845, and then he returned to Toronto.
Immediately upon his return,
Kane headed into the wilderness areas around Georgian Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, and Lake Michigan.
His plan was to sketch Indian life before it disappeared forever.
American Indians were dying so rapidly from European diseases,
such as measles and smallpox, that many people believed they would soon vanish as a race.
Their culture was threatened too.
As white settlers demanded more land,
Indians were being herded into small pieces of land called ""reservations"".
Here they could no longer practice their traditional way of life.
Kane wanted to capture Native American life while it still existed.
Kane returned to Toronto at the end of 1845.
He'd received one good piece of advice and that was if he wanted to travel into the wilderness,
he would have to go with experienced people.
He was able to get the support of the Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, Sir George Simpson.
In May 1846, Kane joined the annual canoe fleet of fur traders going west.
Kane would travel all through the wilderness areas of western Canada and northwestern U.S.A.
During this time, he made hundreds of sketches of Indian life.
Although Kane faced incredible hardships during his travels,
he was able to see what he wanted to see.
He was able to take part in one of the last great Buffalo hunts and killed two large bison himself.
Traveling west with the fur traders he visited many forts and trading posts.
He saw and painted a prairie fire.
He shot a grizzly bear at close range and killed several wolves that attacked his horses.
He learned to travel long distances on snowshoes in winter.
Finally, he arrived at the Pacific coast, where he made some fine drawings of the west coast Indians.
European diseases had reached there just before Kane.
1500 Indians had died near Fort Vancouver in the summer of 1848.
One wealthy chief had ruled 1,000 warriors
and had ten wives, four children and eighteen slaves.
Now he had only one wife, one child and two slaves.
Kane had not come too soon.
However, there were tribes still unaffected by western culture and western diseases.
Kane also traveled widely around the Columbia River in northwestern U.S.A.
Everywhere he went, he sketched Indian chiefs and scenes of native life.
On his return trip, he encountered a large war party of 1,500 braves on the warpath against their traditional enemies.
He was able to sketch the leading chief, Big Snake,
who was later killed in single combat during the battle.
When he arrived back in Toronto, Kane gave an exhibit of his sketches and watercolors.
Most of the rest of his life was spent turning these drawings into finished paintings.

229,229. Plains Indians,B2,229-plains-indians,44,"The best known picture of an American Indian is a warrior in buckskin, riding a horse,
wearing a headdress of eagle feathers and carrying a spear, or bow and arrow.
This is a picture of a Plains Indian,
and it appears in many Hollywood westerns and on the American five-cent piece.
There were many tribes of Plains Indians,
for the Northern American prairies or plains stretch from the northern forest of western Canada
down to the States of Oklahoma and Texas in southern U.S.A.
It's interesting that our image of the Plains Indian is only true for the last couple hundred years.
It was not until the 1600s that Plains Indians began to ride horses.
There were no horses in America until Spanish soldiers brought them in the 1500s and 1600s.
Some of these horses escaped and ran wild on the prairies of America.
It was these wild horses that the Plains Indians learned to tame.
Before they had horses, the Indians hunted buffalo on foot.
Buffalo were huge bison, or wild cattle, which traveled in very large herds.
A big herd might have millions of buffalo.
It was difficult to cross the prairie because these animals blocked your way.
The Plains Indians had various ways of killing buffalo.
Before they had horses, Indian hunters would quietly creep up close to the herd;
then they would fire their arrows together.
There was always the danger that the herd would stampede and trample the hunters.
Another method was to drive the buffalo over a steep cliff.
There are a number of places on the plains where this was done.
Once the Plains Indians had horses, they preferred to hunt buffalo on horseback.
When the tribes started to use guns, they could kill many buffalo.
Artist Paul Kane describes a buffalo hunt in the Red River Valley in 1846.
The hunters carried their bullets in their mouths so they could shoot faster.
They could ride right into the herd, shooting at close quarters.
They would drop an article of clothes on the slain buffalo to mark it for themselves.
Then they would continue the hunt.
After the hunt, the Indians would skin the animals, and the women would dry the meat and store it in fat.
A single hunt might kill more than 30,000 buffalo.
The Plains Indians received nearly everything they needed from the buffalo.
Of course, they used buffalo meat for food.
They also used the buffalo skins for clothing, blankets, and the covering of their teepees.
These teepees were cone-shaped tents, which were easy to put up and take down.
The Plains Indians were nomadic, and followed the animals they hunted.
Since these animals were plentiful, Plains Indians usually led a comfortable life.
They developed complex religions and social rituals, as well as specialized societies or clubs.
There were also rituals and customs for hunting and warfare.
Many Plains Indians fought hard against the settlement of the Great Plains.
The American government discouraged the hunting of buffalo,
because without the buffalo the Plains Indians would not be able to fight.
With the buffalo disappearing, the Plains Indians had to give up fighting
and move into government-sponsored reservations.

230,230. Pocahontas and John Smith,B2,230-pocahontas-and-john-smith,52,"In 1606, King James of England approved the establishment of two colonies along the eastern coast of America.
The northern colony in Maine lasted only a year.
The southern one at Jamestown in Virginia became England's first permanent settlement in America.
In 1607, the Virginia Company sent 104 settlers to Virginia.
The settlers lived in tents all summer.
By September, more than 60 were dead because they lacked good food or water.
The leaders of the colony were not energetic and did little to make the settlers find food.
One member of the company, Captain John Smith, was determined that the colony would survive.
Smith pressured the colonists to build huts, a storehouse, and a church.
He made daring trips to Indian villages, demanding that they give the settlers food in return for beads and copper.
He threatened settlers who were trying to leave the colony and go back to England.
On one of his trips to the interior, Indians attacked John Smith.
They killed his two companions but captured him alive.
He was taken first to the local chief.
This chief was impressed by Smith's compass and spared his life.
His captors dragged Smith from village to village.
He finally arrived at the town belonging to Powhatan.
Powhatan was a great chief for all of the tribes in that region.
Powhatan and his advisors talked about what to do with Smith.
Suddenly, Smith was dragged forward, and his head was pushed against a stone.
The warriors raised their clubs to kill Smith.
Then Pocahontas, who was Powhatan's twelve-year-old daughter, begged for his life.
Her words had no effect, so Pocahontas ran to Smith.
She took his hand in her arms and laid her own head against his head.
Smith was released and went back to Jamestown.
Soon after Smith returned, 100 new settlers from England arrived.
It was a very cold winter,
and in January, Jamestown was accidentally set on fire.
The settlers suffered from cold and hunger the rest of the winter.
Every four or five days, Pocahontas and her attendants came.
They brought food for the hungry settlers.
Even so, half of them died.
In the summer, John Smith explored that part of the coast of America.
He made a map that would be very valuable for future sailors and settlers.
On his return, Smith was elected leader of the colony at Jamestown.
However, some settlers did not like having to follow rules.
Some encouraged the Indians to try to kill Smith.
Chief Powhatan agreed.
He also refused to supply food to the colony, hoping to starve them out.
Pocahontas warned Smith about the plot against his life.
Smith had to fight off several attempts to kill him.
Finally, the colony seemed to be growing, and the Indians became peaceful.
But in late 1609, Smith was injured in an explosion and returned to England.
Pocahontas remained a friend to the colony.
She married John Rolfe, one of the settlers.
In 1616, she traveled to England with her husband and son.
There she saw John Smith once again.
She was so surprised to see him that she was unable to speak for several days.
Pocahontas had believed that Smith was dead.
The following year she died and was buried in England.
Pocahontas' love for Smith, and Smith's determination to fight for the colony,
had saved Jamestown and given the English their first colony in America.

231,231. Remember the Alamo,C1,231-remember-the-alamo,49,"The first Europeans in the American Southwest were Spanish explorers and conquerors.
They were followed by religious orders that set up missions to Christianize the Indians.
One of these missions was San Antonio de Valero;
it was founded in 1718 in what is now San Antonio, Texas.
Later, the mission structure became known as The Alamo.
In 1821, Moses Austin had persuaded the Spanish authorities to give him a charter to settle 200,000 acres in Texas.
The elder Austin died shortly after this.
Five weeks later, his son Stephen Austin traveled to San Antonio to have this charter confirmed by the Spanish governor.
In 1822, Austin led 150 settlers into Texas.
When Austin learned afterwards that Mexico was now independent of Spain,
he journeyed to Mexico City to have his charter reconfirmed.
The Mexicans appointed Austin regional administrator for his colony.
Texas grew rapidly. Cotton farming and cattle ranching were profitable and attracted American settlers.
By 1830, there were 16,000 Americans in Texas - four times the Spanish-Mexican population.
Sam Houston had been a successful soldier and politician.
He was a friend and supporter of President Andrew Jackson.
However, personal problems and political difficulties led him to leave the U.S.A. for Texas.
Meanwhile, the struggle for control of Mexico had been won in 1833 by Santa Ana.
However, the independent thinking of the Texans infuriated Santa Ana.
He had Stephen Austin thrown in jail, and sent an army into Texas.
Austin was released from jail in time to organize the defense of Texas.
The Mexican army was besieged inside the Alamo, and after fierce fighting, surrendered.
The Mexicans were allowed to go home.
Sam Houston was now elected the State's supreme commander.
Not long after this, Santa Ana approached Texas with an army of 6,000 men.
Houston decided not to meet Santa Ana in open battle but to wait for an advantage.
He sent frontiersman Jim Bowie to the Alamo.
Bowie's orders were to leave San Antonio and destroy the Alamo.
When Bowie arrived, however, Texas volunteers were preparing the Alamo for a siege.
Bowie and his men pitched in to help. Other volunteers came.
The fiery William Travis arrived with 25 men.
Then, the famous frontiersman, Davy Crockett, came with a dozen Tennessee sharpshooters.
When Santa Ana attacked, there were 183 Americans inside the fort.
Santa Ana brought up cannon to bombard the Alamo.
As the walls began to crumble, 4,000 Mexicans attacked from all four sides.
The Mexicans overcame all resistance because of their large numbers, but they suffered very heavy losses.
All the American defenders were killed.
While the battle was raging, the Texans back at the colony declared their independence from Mexico.
Sam Houston now gathered men to fight the Mexican army.
At first, he retreated while waiting for a suitable opportunity.
When Santa Ana's rapid advance left the bulk of the Mexican army behind, Houston prepared to fight.
Santa Ana's advance troops moved into swampy land by the San Jacinto River.
Houston's men attacked while the Mexicans were having their midday siesta.
Their battle cry was ""Remember the Alamo!""
The battle was soon over.
Many Mexicans were killed, but only a couple of Texans were killed.
Santa Ana was a prisoner.
Santa Ana readily agreed now to recognize Texas as an independent republic.
Ninety years later, in 1845, Texas became the 28th State of the U.S.A.

232,232. Gribbio,B1,232-gribbio,43,"St. Francis of Assisi, who lived in Italy in the early thirteenth century,
was known for his love of animals.
He was the first person who celebrated the birth of Jesus by gathering live animals around a manger.
He often talked to the birds as he traveled along.
Sometimes, the birds would fly down and sit on his head, shoulders, knees and arms.
But the best-known animal story concerns St. Francis and the Wolf of Gribbio.
St. Francis was known for his humility and his unwillingness to hurt anyone.
Once, when one of his followers spoke harshly to some bandits,
St. Francis told the man to run after the bandits and apologize.
In the same way, St. Francis thought of animals as his brothers and sisters.
Once when he was warned about some dangerous wolves,
he replied that he had never harmed Brother Wolf,
and didn't expect the wolf to harm him.
While St. Francis was staying in the hill town of Gribbio,
he heard about a large, fierce wolf.
The townspeople were terrified of this wolf that had eaten both domestic animals and humans.
St. Francis decided to help the people and went out to talk to the wolf.
The people watched in horror as the wolf came running to attack St. Francis.
But the saint made the sign of the cross.
Then he said to the wolf that, in the name of Jesus, it should stop hurting people.
The wolf then lay down at St. Francis' feet.
St. Francis addressed a little sermon to the wolf.
He recounted all the terrible things that the wolf had done.
But he added that he wanted to make peace between the wolf and the townspeople.
The wolf nodded its head in approval.
In return for the wolf's agreement to keep the peace,
St. Francis promised him that he would arrange for the townspeople to feed him.
When he asked the wolf never again to harm any person or animal,
the wolf nodded again.
Then the wolf put out its paw as a sign that it would keep its promise.
The wolf walked beside St. Francis back into Gribbio.
When a crowd assembled, the saint preached to them about how God had allowed the wolf to terrify them because of their sins.
He told them to repent, and God would forgive them.
Then he spoke of the promise that the wolf had made
and what he had promised the wolf in return.
The people agreed to feed the wolf regularly,
and the wolf again indicated that it would not hurt anyone.
Again, it put its paw in St. Francis' hand.
The wolf and the people kept the agreement.
Two years later the wolf died.
The people remembered how it no longer hurt anyone and that not a single dog ever barked at it.
The townspeople of Gribbio lamented its death.
Whenever it went through town, it had reminded them of the virtues and holiness of St. Francis.

233,233. Summertime,B1,233-summertime,49,"In North America, July and August are holiday months.
Most schools and colleges are not in session then.
Families look for activities to keep the children amused.
Although not all workers get a full two months of holidays, most people take a holiday in the summer.
The summer begins with a national holiday.
In Canada, July 1st is Canada Day.
In the U.S.A., July 4th is Independence Day.
A lot of families are soon on the road.
Some travel to cottages by the lake.
Some go sightseeing or camping.
In Canada, especially, the summers are short.
So people try to make the most of them.
In much of Canada, and parts of the northern U.S.A., are woodlands dotted with lakes.
These regions of rocks, rivers, pine trees and wild animals are not usually suitable for farming.
However, they are ideal places to spend a summer holiday.
They are far from the cities.
The woods are quiet and peaceful.
People fish, go boating or swimming,
have barbeques outside, or play outdoor sports.
Some people spend their whole summer at the cottage.
Others go for a week or two.
City people who don't have a cottage like to go to parks and swimming pools in the city.
If they are near a lake or ocean, they may go there for the day.
Many museums, libraries and art galleries have programs for children in the summer.
Swimming is probably the favorite summer sport.
It feels wonderful on a very hot day to jump into the cool water.
Swimming is also excellent exercise.
Besides swimming, baseball and football are also popular in the summer.
Spending an afternoon or evening at a baseball game is a favorite summer pastime.
Summer is also a favorite time to catch up on reading.
Stories of adventures and love novels are favorite light reading.
But summer is especially a time for traveling across the country.
Some people have a camper or trailer that they can live in.
Some stay in campgrounds and sleep in tents.
Others stay at hotels or motels, while others rent cottages or cabins for a week or two.
Most trips are by car.
Many people visit national parks and other wildlife areas.
Of course, trips along the ocean, and the lakes are favorites.
Along the Atlantic Ocean, the coasts of New England and Canada's Maritime Provinces are especially popular.
On the Pacific coast, tourists travel from California all the way up to Alaska.
Boat cruises along the shores of British Columbia and Alaska are especially popular.
Of course, some people find it most relaxing just to stay at home.
Others cannot afford to travel.
If you have an air-conditioned house, with a television, video player, CD player and computer,
then it can be very pleasant to stay at home.
A lot of new movies are released at the theatres in the summer.
Air-conditioned theatres with new movies and lots of pop and popcorn are favorite summer places.
After two months of summer activities, most people are ready to go back to school and work.
But they usually have lots of happy memories to take back with them.

234,234. Telephone systems,B2,234-telephone-systems,42,"When Alexander Graham Bell developed the telephone in the 1870s, it was fairly simple to use.
You talked into the mouthpiece and then held it to your ear to listen.
For a century or so, using the telephone meant either contacting the operator to dial a number, or dialing yourself.
After that, all you had to do was talk or listen.
Nowadays, the telephone has become a very complex instrument;
it rivals the computer as to the number of possible uses.
Answering machines have been around for several decades, but they are now being replaced by voicemail.
Voicemail does away with the need for an answering machine.
Messages are stored on the system.
That means it's possible to forward the message to someone else's phone,
or transfer the call to a more convenient phone of your own.
You can also use ""call pickup""
so that anyone on your group can answer another's phone.
Conference calls have become very common.
This is when one person phones first one person, then another,
and keeps adding people to the telephone conversation.
This can regularly be done with up to six people.
It is very useful for business discussions where different people need to talk about the same thing.
It also speeds up the process of consensus, and allows everybody to be in on the decision or discussion.
The modern phone has many more features.
If you don't want the caller to know what is being said in your office, you can push the ""mute"" button.
If you want to hang up without putting the receiver down, press ""goodbye"".
If you don't want to receive calls, just forward them all into your voicemail.
Newer phones will indicate when you have voicemail messages.
If you have trouble with these features, an automatic voice will tell you your options.
This help-system is built into the telephone.
For example, the help-voice will tell you how to set up a distribution list,
so that you can send the same voice message to a number of people.
It will also tell you how to send a message directly into someone's voicemail.
You can designate your message to go to the top of the recipient's voicemail list.
You can also program it so that the recipient cannot forward it.
Some systems have limits on how much space can be used for individual voicemail.
There are a number of courtesies that voicemail users should follow.
Your greeting on your voicemail should be simple.
If you are unable to take calls for any reason,
you might want to explain that in your recorded greeting.
If you are on vacation, you might want to include that information in your greeting.
Don't use voicemail as a way to avoid answering the telephone.
Some people use voicemail to screen calls;
this can be annoying to someone who can never contact you directly.
Check your messages regularly and reply to them promptly.
Enjoy the telecommunications revolution!

235,235. Texas,B1,235-texas,42,"The state of Texas is famous for having the biggest and best of everything.
Before Alaska became a state, Texas was the largest American state.
It was also famous for its huge cattle ranches.
Cotton is a major crop, but much of the wealth comes from oil and gas.
People think of Texans as being wealthy because there have been lots of cattle and oil millionaires.
In the late nineteenth century, Texas cattlemen used to drive their herds north to Kansas.
There a train to the east shipped the cows.
Eventually, the railroad came to Texas and the great cattle drive stopped.
By then, many Texans owned large ranches and were quite wealthy.
In the twentieth century, oil has made many Texans wealthy.
Oil refining has led to chemical industries and synthetic products.
Most Texans now live in cities.
Many oil companies have their headquarters in Dallas.
Other large manufacturing cities are Houston, Corpus Christi,
Fort Worth and Austin, which is the Capital of Texas.
Several cities, such as San Antonio and El Paso, have a strong Spanish influence.
This dates back to the first Spanish visitors in the sixteenth century.
The old mission at San Antonio is famous as the Alamo,
where an important battle for Texas independence was fought.
Texas is a huge area with mountains, deserts, prairies, rivers and islands.
The rugged beauty of its grasslands and deserts attracts many tourists.
For a state that is mostly dry, Texas has a remarkable variety of wildflowers in the spring.
Its animals and birds differ from other parts of the U.S.A.
Texas has the armored insect eater, the Armadillo;
the swift running bird, the Roadrunner; prairie dogs, jackrabbits,
kangaroo rats, wild pigs, horned lizards, and 100 species of snakes!
As might be expected also, it has many beautiful kinds of cacti and other desert plants.
At its largest, Texas is more than 600 miles wide by 600 miles long.
Such a large area develops a distinct culture of its own.
And Texans are widely recognized by their accent and manner of speaking,
their attitudes and interests and their sense of independence and self-reliance.
Texas is also known for its beautiful women, who regularly win national beauty contests.
Its men have a reputation for being rugged,
for not talking more than they have to and for being straightforward and honest.
Although many people think of cowboys and Indians when they think of Texas, it is a center for high-tech industries.
The American space program has its headquarters in Houston, and Mission Control Center is there.
Texas is also an important manufacturer of computers and other high-tech products.
Oil production is still important in Texas, but it ranks third as a source of revenue behind manufacturing and tourism.
The colorful history of Texas and its wonderful scenery contribute to a thriving tourist industry.
Texas is also an important business and financial area.
Yes, even though times have changed,
Texans proudly maintain that their state still has the biggest and best of everything.

236,236. The Ford Pinto case,C1,236-the-ford-pinto-case,37,"Businessmen often complain that their profits are negatively affected by government regulations.
On the other hand, history has proven that it is necessary to regulate business in at least one area - public safety.
There is ample evidence that consideration for the safety of the public is not always a priority in business decisions.
Back in 1912, the Titanic smashed into an iceberg, killing hundreds of people.
It was going too fast through a large collection of icebergs, while attempting to set a speed record.
Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats to accommodate the passengers.
Usually when such a tragedy occurs, the company is not found guilty.
Instead, safety regulations are enacted for future cases.
In the future, ships were ordered to carry a sufficient supply of lifeboats.
In 1978, the Ford Motor Company was indicted on the charge of homicide.
This was the first time such a charge had been brought against an American corporation.
It related to the deaths of three teenage girls who were burned up when their Ford Pinto was hit from behind.
The prosecution charged that the Ford Company knowingly manufactured a dangerous car.
Behind this story is the pressure on Ford to produce a small car to compete with imported vehicles.
The Pinto was rushed into production in spite of warnings that the gas tank was in a dangerous position.
It would have cost Ford an additional $11 per car to fix the problem.
Ford decided not to.
Later, Ford produced a cost-benefit analysis to justify their position.
Estimating that the faulty design would cause 180 additional deaths,
Ford valued these at $200,000 per person.
This cost was far less than equipping 12.5 million vehicles with $11 protectors.
So Ford felt that they had made the right decision.
Ford executives were acquitted on the charge of homicide.
Nonetheless, Ford had to pay out millions of dollars in out-of-court settlements.
These were paid to families who had lost relatives in Pinto accidents.
This case shows how far a company will go to protect its profits.
For more than eight years, Ford lobbied the government not to tighten safety standards on cars.
As long as the Pinto was profitable, Ford did not want to change the design.
Although Ford made a lot of money on the Pinto, their reputation was tarnished.
The Ford Pinto case is one of many which point to the need for governments to set safety standards.
No business wants to recall its products, or leave them sitting idly in a warehouse,
or expend large sums of money for upgrading and repairs.
No airplane company wants to have its planes in the hangar when they could be in the air making money for the corporation.
As a result, commercial companies are seldom motivated to look closely at product or service safety.
This is especially true today when the ""bottom line"" in business is seen as a justification for every decision.
For this reason, governments have to oversee issues of public safety.
Most businesses are too busy working on profits to have much time or concern for doing so.

237,237. The golden man El Dorado,C1,237-the-golden-man-el-dorado,60,"When Christopher Columbus sailed west from Spain in 1492,
he was trying to reach the Spice Islands (which today are called Indonesia).
Spices were very scarce and valuable in Europe at this time.
No one knew that two vast oceans and the American continents lay between Europe and Asia.
Columbus did not find spices in America, but he did bring home some gold trinkets.
The American Indians wore these as jewellery.
Gold, not spices, was to become the biggest motive for exploration.
Expeditions into the interior of the Americas were very costly and very risky.
Only by promising the authorities huge profits could sailors and soldiers raise money for their expeditions.
They also needed to promise rich rewards in order to get followers and crews.
If a leader returned to Europe without gold and jewels, he might end up in jail.
No wonder the Spanish conquerors were always searching for gold.
At first, the Spaniards stayed around the coasts of the Caribbean Sea,
but stories of gold in the interior tempted them to explore inland.
They asked the Indians where their gold jewellery came from.
The Indians would point further inland.
They said that a wealthy people lived in the high mountains that traded gold and emeralds for pearls, cotton and shells.
The Spanish Emperor had given the rights to exploit present-day Venezuela and Colombia to his German bankers in 1528.
So Germans - Dalfinger, Federmann and Hohermuth - led a series of expeditions into the jungles, grasslands and mountains.
Meanwhile, Spanish conquerors had found immense riches in gold and silver.
Hernando Cortes had captured the Kingdom of the Aztecs in Mexico in 1519.
He had sent immense treasures to Europe.
Soon after this, Francesco Pizarro began to explore the west coast of South America.
In 1531, Pizarro invaded Peru and destroyed the Kingdom of the Incas.
Pizarro melted down the gold and silver treasures of the Incas, and sent gold and silver bricks back to Spain.
The rush to find more gold became very heated.
Rumors came down from the mountains of Colombia about a golden man, El hombre Dorado.
There were stories about a king so rich that he wore gold dust instead of a coat.
Colombia was the Kingdom of the Chibchas.
They were a trading people who traded salt and emeralds for gold, cotton, pearls, and shells.
The actual gold did not come from their kingdom.
It was found in the mountain rivers, and brought to the Chibchas for refining and metalwork.
Several armies converged on Chibcha territory.
The first to arrive was the Spaniard Quesada,
coming up the Magdalene River from the Caribbean.
He found the chief cities of the Chibchas and seized their gold and emeralds.
Shortly afterwards, one of Pizarro's captains arrived from Peru and Ecuador.
Then the German Federmann arrived from Venezuela.
Quesada gave the latecomers some gold and jewels to ease their disappointment.
Quesada's men also found out about the Golden Man.
High in the mountains was a lake created by a meteorite.
The Indians believed that the 'golden god' from the sky now lived at the bottom of the lake.
When a new leader of the tribe was elected, he was covered in grease,
and fine gold dust was blown over his body so that he appeared to be made of gold.
He was taken out to the middle of the lake on a raft.
He would jump into the lake, and stay in the water till the gold dust was washed off.
It was considered an offering to the god.
Gold ornaments were also tossed in the lake.
Then the king and his followers would return to the shore.
This ceremony was stopped several generations before the Europeans arrived.
Many people were unwilling to believe that this was the whole story.
They began to search for a golden city hidden in the jungle.
Many explorers perished in this search.
In their search for gold, the Spanish conquerors destroyed the great Indian civilizations of America.
Towns and villages had been ruined,
thousands of people killed and wonderful pieces of art melted down.
Some Indians believed that gold must be a food that Europeans desperately needed to stay alive.
In many cases, the Europeans destroyed the trading and social systems that had produced their wealth.
When we think about the great achievements of a few conquerors and explorers,
we are also sad about how much death and damage they caused.

238,238. The Grand Canyon,B1,238-the-grand-canyon,43,"The Grand Canyon is one of the most spectacular sights in nature.
It is found in one section of the valley of the Colorado River.
The river begins its course high in the Rocky Mountains of the State of Colorado.
The river travels a total of 1,400 miles through Colorado, Utah and Arizona
and into the Gulf of California.
It forms part of Arizona's border with Nevada and California.
The Colorado River is a very swift and muddy river.
It carries dirt and rocks down from the mountains.
The story is told of an old fur trader who was attacked by Indians high up the river.
His only escape was down the Colorado River in a small boat.
It was a terrifying trip through rapids and around rocks at top speed.
The fur trader was found some days later in very rough shape hundreds of miles down the river.
No one would believe that he had come so far so fast.
The Grand Canyon stretches for about 250 miles in the State of Arizona.
The canyon was carved out by the flow of the river itself.
In places the canyon is more than a mile deep.
It stretches from 4 to 18 miles wide at the top.
The canyon valley contains worn rocks that rise up like a mountain range.
The canyon has been worn down through many layers of rock.
The river has cut its way down through layers of sandstone, limestone and shape to the granite bedrock.
The different layers are of different colors,
and the rocks appear very beautiful, especially at sunrise and sunset.
Because the canyon is so deep, the climate changes as you go down into the valley.
At the top, the climate is typical of a mountain area, with evergreen trees.
Next, you have typical forest trees.
Third, there are plants like cacti that grow in warm deserts.
Finally, there are sub-tropical plants at the valley bottom.
Tourists can ride down the narrow trails to the bottom of the valley on mules.
On one side is the rock wall of the canyon, and on the other side is a steep drop down to the bottom.
Tourists have to trust their guide, and the mule that they are riding, to get them down safely.
The trails zigzag back and forth, and the tourist going down travels much more than a mile.
Some 1,000 square miles of the area became the Grand Canyon National Park in 1919.
Because the Colorado River is very swift and runs through dry country,
several dams have been built along it.
These are designed to harness its power, save its water and provide recreational opportunities.
The best-known dam is Hoover Dam, formerly Boulder Dam, on the Arizona-Nevada border.
This impressive structure is 727 feet high, and 1,282 feet long.
Elevators are used to carry workers up and down inside the dam.
The water, which is backed up by the Hoover Dam, forms Lake Mead.
Lake Mead is used to irrigate nearby land, as well as for boating and fishing.
The dam itself is a major source of electric power for this section of the country.
Visitors to the Grand Canyon are often filled with awe by the size and beauty of the canyon.
People seem very small in comparison to the immense cliffs, valleys and the mighty river.

239,239. The Niagara Parks Commission,B2,239-the-niagara-parks-commission,43,"Niagara Falls, Canada, became a major tourist attraction in the mid-1830s.
By this time, roads, canals and railways were able to bring people from urban centers, like New York and Boston.
However, the chance for big profits attracted dishonest businessmen.
One hotel in the 1860s was popularly known as the ""Cave of the Forty Thieves"".
There were many complaints from tourists about tricks that were used to get their money.
Some businessmen tried to put up fences around the Falls,
so that all visitors would have to pay them to see the Falls.
In time, these complaints reached the ears of important people.
In 1873, Lord Dufferin, the Governor-General of Canada,
proposed that the government buy all the land around the Falls.
On the American side, New York State bought 412 acres around the American Rainbow Falls in 1885.
In the same year, land was bought near the Canadian Horseshoe Falls and named Queen Victoria Park.
A commission was formed to obtain control of all land along the Niagara River.
This was made easier because a narrow strip along the river was already government land.
However, the Commission wanted to preserve all the beautiful scenery along the river and near the Falls for the general public.
The first commissioner of the park was Sir Casimir Gzowski, a distinguished engineer of Polish birth.
Before the Queen Victoria Park Commission began to buy up land besides the Falls,
tourists had to pay for everything.
There were no public washrooms, no drinking fountains, and no safety barriers around the Falls.
As a result, it was not uncommon for tourists crowding close to the Falls,
or hypnotized by the flow of the river, to step too close and fall in.
The commission took care of these problems and also set up parks and picnic areas.
In 1927, the Commission's name was changed to the Niagara Parks Commission.
It now supervises numerous attractions and parks from Niagara-on-the-Lake on Lake Ontario,
down to Fort Erie on Lake Erie.
Each section of the 56-kilometer stretch of Niagara Parks has its own places of interest.
These are joined by the Niagara Parkway, a road that runs the whole length of the river.
Sir Winston Churchill called the parkway, ""The prettiest Sunday afternoon drive in the world"".
The Niagara Parks Commission operates restaurants, parks and gardens,
rides, museums and historic houses,
golf courses, native sites and gift shops.
Near the Falls are restaurants, parks, greenhouses,
the ""Journey Behind the Falls"" and the ""Maid of the Mist"" boat ride.
North of the Falls, at Niagara Gorge, are the Spanish Aero Car Ride and the Great Gorge Adventure.
The Commission also operates a School of Horticulture, with large gardens.
Queenston Heights is a park commemorating one of Canada's heroes, General Isaac Brock.
In nearby Queenston are historic houses connected with two other important Canadians,
Laura Secord and William Lyon MacKenzie.
The Commission also operates two historic forts, dating from the War of 1812,
Fort George and Old Fort Erie.
The Niagara Parks Commission has played a major role in making Niagara Falls and the Niagara River
one of the leading tourist areas in the world.
The Commission shows how governments can work to make visits to natural wonders like Niagara Falls a good experience for the general public.

240,240. The Welland Canal,B2,240-the-welland-canal,44,"Before railways and automobiles became common,
transporting goods over long distances was a difficult chore.
In early North America, roads were often bad or non-existent.
In the winter, snow and cold weather made travel difficult.
Frontier farmers had trouble selling their crops because it was hard to get them to the cities.
Often rivers and lakes were the best ways to travel.
Fur traders carried their furs and other supplies in canoes.
But even large canoes were not big enough to hold a shipment of wheat.
Rapids and waterfalls meant that goods had to be taken out of the canoe and carried to the next body of calm water.
One way to improve water transportation was to build a canal.
In New York State, Governor DeWitt Clinton had constructed the Erie Canal from the Niagara River to the Hudson River,
soon after the War of 1812.
Because relations between the United States and Canada were still not very friendly,
this was another reason to build a canal on the Canadian side.
Canals could be used to move supplies and troops during wartime.
Sometimes the British government would forbid Canadian farmers to sell food to the U.S.A.
Without a canal to move their farm produce, crops were sometimes left to rot.
A St. Catharines, Ontario, merchant named William Hamilton Merritt
thought about all these things in the 1820s.
He also thought that flourmills needed a more reliable source of water to operate.
St. Catharines is on Twelve Mile Creek below the Niagara Escarpment.
This creek runs towards Lake Ontario.
It rises above the Escarpment, which stands from 150 to 300 feet high,
then runs towards Lake Ontario.
If Merritt could join the Twelve Mile Creek to one of the rivers, which ran to Lake Erie,
the canal would provide transportation and waterpower.
The problem was to find a way to move boats up the escarpment.
From 1824 to 1829, Merritt and his friends hired laborers to dig away tons of dirt and rock.
Nearly all the work was done with shovels, pickaxes, horses and wagons.
In places, the ground was soft and landslides occurred.
In other places, the men had to dig through solid granite rock.
Merritt's main problem, however, was raising the money to pay for the construction.
After sinking all the money that he, his family and friends had into the canal, more was needed.
Merritt went to Toronto, New York and finally London, England to get the financial support he needed.
The problem of getting the boats to climb the escarpment was solved by a series of 35 wooden locks.
These carried a ship 327 feet upwards.
The ship would enter a lock with a small amount of water.
More water would come into the lock, lifting the boat another ten or fifteen feet.
Then the ship would move into the next lock, and be lifted up again.
Boats going in the opposite direction were lowered instead of lifted.
The Welland Canal has been rebuilt three times since the first canal opened in 1829.
Now large sea-going and lake vessels cross the Niagara Peninsula from Lake Ontario to Lake Erie.
They carry grain, coal, iron ore, oil and many other bulk products.
The Welland Canal remains one of the most important commercial waterways in the world.

241,241. Walmart Stores,B2,241-walmart-stores,40,"Walmart is now the world's largest retail organization.
Walmart employs around 1.2 million people worldwide.
In 2000, Walmart had sales of more than $191 billion with profits of $6.3 billion.
Profits increased 16% from the previous year.
People have come to expect that Walmart's profits will increase substantially every year.
Each year more stores are opened, and Walmart expands into new countries.
Walmart also enters new areas of business nearly every year.
Few people know that Walmart is also a major real estate company.
Sam Walton opened his Walton's Five and Dime in Bentonville, Arkansas, in 1950.
Twelve years later he opened the first Walmart in Bentonville.
His business philosophy was simple
good prices, great selection and a friendly greeting.
Walton was known for the ""Ten Foot Attitude"".
This means that any employee should greet any customer who is within ten feet of them.
He emphasized that it is important to speak to people before they speak to you.
Walton also believed that good deals from suppliers should be passed along to customers.
The combination of low prices and friendly service is basic to Walmart's success.
That one store in Bentonville has become 4,203 stores in the U.S.A,
plus another 1,000 outside the United States.
Walton died in 1992,
but his business philosophy continues to be preached at Walmarts.
Each store has greeters who meet the customers at the door, and deal with any special needs they have.
Having greeters gives the effect of having more service clerks than Walmart really has.
Compared to some other department stores, Walmart has relatively fewer employees.
Walmart also has the Walmart Foundation, which sponsors numerous good causes.
Among their programs are high school scholarships, fundraising for local hospitals and sick children,
environmental concerns and community ""matching grant"" outreach.
So, what's not to like about Walmart?
The main complaint is that their business style is extremely aggressive.
Walmart's attitudes towards manufacturers and suppliers are:
""You do it our way, or we won't do business with you"".
This puts Walmart at an advantage over smaller retails who don't have the same retailing power.
Walmart has been known to demand that its suppliers provide products at discount for Walmart store openings;
levy fines for shipment errors;
tell manufacturers what products, styles and colors to make, etc.
Walmart expects product delivery in two days, and expects manufacturers to cooperate with its promotional and retailing strategies.
In effect any company that works with Walmart becomes one of their employees
Any company, which so dominates one area of the market, will have a lot of power.
So far, Walmart has been successful in getting what it wants,
and providing customers with what they want.

242,242. Student newspapers,B2,242-student-newspapers,45,"In North America, most colleges and universities, as well as many high schools, have a student newspaper.
These newspapers focus on happenings at the school.
They inform the student population about activities on campus
and often include world news, which is relevant to student interests.
In addition, there are opinion pieces by the student editors,
which reflect their views on the school and the world.
Sometimes these editorials oppose the way that the school is being run.
Occasionally, school officials will try to shut down or censor student papers,
if they find their writing embarrassing or offensive.
But usually these disagreements are resolved by discussion.
At some colleges, the student newspaper is connected to a professional program in journalism.
But, most of the time, the idea behind the paper is to get students to research the facts,
debate the issues, and learn how to get their opinions expressed.
If these students go on to become professional journalists that is fine,
but it is not really expected.
You might wonder whether enough things happen at a college to fill out a weekly paper.
Yes, indeed! Schools and universities reflect the real world.
There are often problems with the budget and cuts to programs.
New buildings go up, or are torn down.
Policies change; tuition goes up;
classrooms become crowded; and personnel come and go.
University morale and funding often reflect government policies and social attitudes.
These tie the college to the larger world.
Editorials often comment on how national and world events affect the university.
At the same time, there are many things going on within the university.
Construction disturbs classes; offices are broken into;
computers are stolen; accidents happen in the parking lot;
students die on the roads during the holidays;
sports teams win or lose; graduation takes place;
students and instructors win awards;
plays are put on; distinguished visitors speak;
rock bands are in concert.
Then there is always the question of student rights and responsibilities.
What kinds of student behavior are unacceptable?
Should the university pay attention to student activities off-campus?
Committees meet, with student representation, to set guidelines for these matters.
Another issue is who sets the agenda for the university.
Corporate sponsors today are buying exclusive rights to distribute their products on campus.
Governments are expecting universities to follow official policies in order to receive funding.
Social groups are demanding that university policies reflect their special interests.
So there is no shortage of topics for student journalists to address.
Of course, they also write about everything that young people are interested in,
music, movies, computers, sports, travel and pop culture.
Student newspapers are an important training group for democracy.
They are also very interesting to read.

243,243. Canadian colleges and universities,B2,243-canadian-colleges-and-universities,40,"Canada has about fifty accredited universities spread across ten provinces.
All, except one, are primarily government-funded.
This means that there is considerable uniformity regarding programs, administration and policy.
Private colleges tend to be smaller and are mostly based on a religious curriculum.
Most universities offer programs in the Humanities, Social Sciences and pure Sciences.
Many have additional faculties such as Education and Physical Education.
Many programs that lead directly to a position in the workplace are given at community colleges.
Community colleges differ from universities because their programs involve job training and practical experience.
For example, they might offer courses in areas such as computer programming,
journalism, photography, social work, dentistry and nursing.
Their programs are considered to be less abstract and academic than university programs.
Many students see university as being more fun than community college.
They don't have to worry immediately about getting a job,
and the social life is often better at university.
However, a university degree may be less likely to lead directly to a job.
Nowadays, university programs, which are work-related,
such as business administration, education, child studies and psychology,
seem especially popular.
Universities, however, were founded mainly as liberal arts institutions.
This means that their original intent was to prepare people to be well-rounded human beings and knowledgeable citizens.
So nearly all universities have programs in literature,
languages, philosophy, culture, music,
history and politics, as well as studies that are more job-related.
A pass B.A. or B.Sc. degree in Canada is normally three full years of study after secondary school.
A bachelor degree with honors includes one more year of study.
A Master's degree is a further one or two years.
A doctorate usually requires four or more years.
This is similar to the United States, except that their bachelor degree is normally three years,
and their master's degree may be up to three years.
To gain entrance to university you usually need to graduate from secondary school with a B average.
Some programs will require an A average.
Tuition costs have gone up in recent years as governments have handed over less money to colleges and universities.
More students now have to work during the school year to pay their expenses.
Attending college and university is known to be one of the most carefree periods in a person's life.
As long as you keep up with your readings and assignments, you should be able to avoid major difficulties.
Facilities for athletics, student radio and newspapers, pubs and lounges
and generally pleasant surroundings make campus life agreeable.
It is a good time to make friends, learn new skills and take calculated risks.
Moreover, colleges and universities are a good practical investment,
as they help to prepare young people for a changing world.

244,244. Coffee and donuts,B1,244-coffee-and-donuts,42,"""Let's go for coffee!""
All over North America friends like to meet at the coffee shop.
Here people sit and talk about the day's business, news and sports,
personal concerns, shop talk, or simply gossip.
Coffee shops have an informal atmosphere that encourages conversation.
You don't have to dress up either!
Students drop in wearing T-shirts and blue jeans, and sit beside businessmen wearing suits and ties.
Many coffee shops are open 24 hours a day, including Sundays and holidays.
That way, people who work at night or who have trouble sleeping can drop in at any time.
Because coffee and donuts are relatively inexpensive,
people feel comfortable sitting for a while, knowing that they are not spending a lot of money.
Although coffee and donuts are the main items sold at coffee shops,
many also serve other beverages and desserts, and sometimes a light lunch.
Many patrons have a favorite kind of coffee or other drink
and will drive past other coffee shops to go to one that serves the flavor they like.
Visitors from other countries are often surprised at how roomy these coffee shops can be.
Some are as large as regular restaurants.
Having a nice bit of space around them encourages people to relax.
Some people arrange regular dates and meet every day, or every week, at the same time.
For example, retired friends may get together every weekday morning at 10 a.m.
Others stop every morning at the drive-in line to get their coffee for work.
Even people who have coffee machines at home or at work
like to go to coffee shops to get a special kind of coffee or a favorite treat.
It might seem that the business owners would not make much money just selling a few items,
but in fact, many coffee shops do extremely well,
especially if they are located in a busy traffic area.
Then business tends to be steady all through the day.
Not only do people come in and sit down, but there is usually a lot of take-out business as well.
People go to coffee shops not only to socialize with family and friends,
but also to discuss business or treat their employees to a snack.
Others go there to read the newspaper or a favorite magazine.
Some people even go there to do work.
This article was written in a coffee shop!
Of course, people who come here usually like coffee and donuts.
Coffee is the favorite hot drink in North America, but most shops also serve tea,
hot chocolate and cappuccino, as well as some other cold beverages.
Donuts are usually round, and are small deep-fried breads with various toppings.
Most donuts have a hole in the middle.
Even these ""holes"", which are punched out of the donut, can be sold separately, as a kind of mini-donut.
Everywhere you go in North America, you will see coffee shops.
So take half an hour to stop in and relax.
You'll enjoy the great North American ""coffee break""!

245,245. Medical Missionary,B2,245-medical-missionary,63,"During the reign of Queen Victoria (1837-1901), British people traveled around the whole world.
They charted the seas, mapped out distant countries and studied plants, animals and people.
They also claimed many lands for England.
This kind of international travel was made easier by improved transportation and communication.
New inventions such as steamships, trains,
telegraphs and telephones made long distances seem smaller.
Of course, people had different reasons for going to distant lands.
Some were businessmen who saw economic opportunities overseas.
Soldiers wanted fame and a chance to enlarge the British Empire.
Big-game hunters wanted to be the first to shoot strange animals and bring back trophies to England.
Scientists intended to study unknown animals and plants.
Missionaries planned to be the first to introduce Christianity to faraway people.
In 1836 a young Scotsman called David Livingstone began to study medicine in Glasgow.
Livingstone intended to become a medical missionary.
This means that he would be a doctor, as well as a preacher and teacher.
Livingstone (1813-1873) came from a poor family.
From an early age, he had worked 14 hours a day in a clothing factory for very little pay.
But he was determined to learn.
He took his books with him to the factory and read as he worked.
Then, after work, he would go to his teacher to learn more.
Livingstone's goal was to teach faraway people about Jesus.
However, unlike some missionaries, he was also interested in science, geography and exploring.
He had planned to go to China in 1839,
but because of the Opium Wars no missionaries were being sent there.
Instead, he asked to go to South Africa.
Europeans had traveled around the coasts of Africa for hundreds of years.
But very few white people had traveled inland.
A missionary named Robert Moffatt who had begun a mission at Kuruman in the interior inspired Livingstone.
Livingstone arrived in Kuruman in 1841.
This was the farthest outpost of white settlement, and no one seemed to want to go further inland.
Livingstone felt that the missionaries should go to the Africans,
rather than waiting for the Africans to come to them.
With a fellow missionary he set out.
When they came to an African tribe, they would talk to the chief and ask permission to preach to his people.
Livingstone would also set up a tent and treat the people who had diseases.
After a while, he would move on to the next tribe.
Once Livingstone learned the Bantu language he would talk to many Africans.
But sometimes he needed interpreters.
There were many diseases, including malaria and sleeping sickness.
Livingstone suffered much of his life from river fever.
He was also so weak that he rode on the back of an ox.
Livingstone wanted to stop the slave trade.
At this time, the slave trade was the most profitable business in Africa.
Livingstone hoped that if other kinds of trade were developed,
then slavery could be abolished.
In order to open up trade, he wanted to find an easy route into the center of Africa.
Livingstone kept going further into the interior.
He was probably the first European to cross the Kalahari Desert before reaching Lake Ngami in present-day Botswana.
Not long after, he traveled further inland.
He explored the sources of the Zambezi
and Kasai rivers and eventually reached the west coast of Africa and Luanda, Angola.
Livingstone was being criticized for neglecting missionary work in order to explore.
Livingstone replied that he was opening up the continent for missionaries.
Meanwhile, he was becoming famous as a great explorer.
The British government commissioned him to explore the Zambezi River.
They hoped that ships could sail up the river into the interior.
Unfortunately, the Zambezi had too many rapids.
However, Livingstone did find a route up the Shire River to Lake Nyassa.
He continued to struggle against the slave trade, which was now being taken over by Arabs.
Livingstone died in Africa in 1873.
He was the first white man to explore Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and surrounding areas.
He was not only a great explorer, but also a fine doctor and a good missionary.
Nowadays, the countries that Livingstone visited are nearly all Christian, just as he had hoped they would be.

246,246. Favorite cookies,B1,246-favorite-cookies,38,"North Americans are known for their ""sweet tooth"".
This means that they like snacks with lots of sugar.
Americans drink a lot of coffee, tea and hot chocolate,
and usually they have something sweet with their drink.
Cookies are one of America's favorite desserts.
The word ""cookie"" comes from a Dutch word meaning ""little cake"".
People from Europe brought their favorite recipes with them when they came to America.
The English brought their custom of having tea in the afternoon.
Usually with their tea they would have cakes or biscuits.
Biscuits are usually hard wafers like, for example, ginger snaps.
In fact, the Italian slang word for Englishman is ""cake eater"".
In the early days, all cookies were homemade.
But, in the late nineteenth century, biscuits began to be manufactured in large quantities by machine.
In 1912, the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) in the U.S.A. introduced Oreo cookies.
This cookie has a rich cream vanilla filling between two crispy chocolate wafers.
This product was designed to meet the demand for an English-style biscuit.
Oreos were good to dunk in a drink, to eat whole, to eat in parts, or to use in cooking.
Oreos have become both America's and the world's favorite commercial cookie.
New varieties of Oreos are added regularly to the original product.
Although commercial biscuits like Oreos are very popular, many people prefer home-baked ones.
In fact, there is a whole line of commercial cookies called ""home-style"",
which try to imitate homemade cookies.
The most popular cookie in America can be either bought in a package or baked at home.
These are chocolate chip cookies.
Ruth and Kenneth Wakefield operated the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts.
One day in 1930, Mrs. Wakefield ran out of baking chocolate for her baking cookies.
She broke up a chocolate bar and added the pieces to her cookie mix.
She expected that the chocolate bits would melt into the dough when she baked them.
But they didn't.
Soon chocolate chip cookies were being made commercially by adding small chunks of chocolate to regular chocolate cookie dough.
Lots of people like to make their own by adding commercial chocolate chips to their dough.
Now chocolate chip cookies are the most popular kind of cookie in North America.
Over seven billion are eaten annually here.
Half of all the cookies baked in American homes are chocolate chip cookies.
Experiments in baking and packaging have led to new kinds of cookies.
Recently, soft cookies have become very popular.
Since they are packaged in foil, they can stay fresh and soft for many months.
It seems likely that the love of cookies will be around for a long time.

247,247. Florence Nightingale,B2,247-florence-nightingale,54,"It could be said that Florence Nightingale was responsible for inventing modern nursing.
Indeed, Nightingale did open up the professions to women generally.
Her example and influence during the mid to late nineteenth century were an important factor in opening doors to women.
Nightingale's own life reflects many of these changes.
She was born in 1820, and was one of two daughters of a wealthy English family.
Her mother was a beautiful society lady
who had once turned down a favored suitor because he was not wealthy enough.
She wanted both her daughters to be socially popular and to marry rich and important men.
Florence's father ensured that she had a good education.
But she was frustrated because girls and women were always under parental supervision.
She felt called to a life of action,
but her family insisted that she divide her time between being with her family and attending social functions.
She was not allowed to do anything on her own.
When she was 16, Nightingale said that God spoke to her and called her to do His work.
But Florence didn't know what work she was being called to do.
Years passed away while she sat with her mother and sister,
or attended dances and concerts or travelled to Europe.
Nightingale became more angry and rebellious.
She offended her family and friends by refusing to marry several prominent men who wanted to marry her.
By the time she was 24, she had decided to be a nurse.
But how did one become a nurse?
At that time, the profession didn't seem promising.
The only respectable nurses were those women in religious orders
that ministered to the patient's spiritual health, but were not trained in medicine.
The majority of nurses were poor, untrained women
who were suspected of being too fond of men or alcohol, or both.
In fact, one hospital preferred to hire unwed mothers as nurses
because they had no reputations to lose.
Nightingale's family was horrified by her plans.
Their opposition delayed her plans but could not stop them.
In 1850 she visited a hospital in Germany for the first time.
In 1853, she was appointed superintendent of a women's nursing home in London.
But, Florence was still waiting for her true calling.
In 1855, the Times of London was printing reports from the Crimean War.
France and England were fighting Russia in the Crimean Peninsula.
After one allied victory, the wounded French soldiers were well taken care of,
but the wounded English soldiers were left to die.
Back in England there was a public outcry.
It was Florence's opportunity.
She was soon on her way to Istanbul, Turkey, with 38 nurses.
Scutari, Turkey, was the hospital where the British wounded were brought.
This so-called hospital was a death pit, where 42 out of every 100 men died.
The army was unwilling to listen to Miss Nightingale or to let her tend the wounded.
She had to wait until conditions became so bad that the regular medical officers were overwhelmed.
As soon as the army turned to her, she immediately went to work.
She had the entire hospital cleaned, a new kitchen set up, and a good water supply obtained.
The death rate dropped to 22 out of every 1,000.
Nightingale became famous overnight.
Although her efforts in the Crimean War injured her health, she continued her work back in London.
She published a 1,000-page report on medical conditions in the British Army,
several books on nursing and her own proposals and suggestions.
She also set up a training school for nurses.
Long before her death in 1910, she had seen nursing become a well-established profession.
Almost single-handedly she had helped to bring about proper treatment of the sick and injured.

248,248. Harriet Tubman,B2,248-harriet-tubman,50,"Before the American Civil War, the economy of the Southern States was based on the use of slave labor.
The social and political leaders of the Old South were the plantation owners.
Many of these owned hundreds of black slaves.
The slaves were mainly used to pick crops like cotton and tobacco.
Harriet Tubman was born in 1820 in the State of Maryland.
As a girl of seven, she was sent into the fields to work with the adult slaves.
The slaves worked from sunrise to sunset picking the crops.
Often they sang songs while they worked.
Slaves were not taught to read or write.
It was feared that reading and writing would help slaves to escape the plantations.
Harriet Tubman was illiterate.
Later in life, when she was in danger of being captured, she picked up a book and pretended to read it.
This fooled the bounty hunters.
When she was 15, Harriet helped another slave to escape.
The overseer was so angry with her that he hit her over the head with an iron weight.
Harriet was knocked unconscious for many days.
All the rest of her life she suffered from headaches and sudden sleeping spells.
Harriet escaped from the plantation to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Since Pennsylvania was not a slave state, Harriet was fairly safe there.
She was able to return secretly to the plantation and bring the rest of her family to freedom.
There were already people working to bring black slaves up from the South to freedom.
These people, both white and black, used the language of the railroad.
Escaped slaves were called passengers, safe houses were called stations,
and the guides were called conductors.
Harriet soon became a conductor in the Underground Railway.
In 1850, the American government passed a second Fugitive Slave Act.
This put more pressure on Northern States to return escaped slaves to the South.
Because of this, the Underground Railway went further north to Canada.
In 1793, Upper Canada (Ontario) had passed a law, bringing a gradual stop to slavery.
In 1834, slavery was abolished in the whole British Empire.
A lot of escaped slaves had come to Canada before 1850,
but now nearly all escaped slaves tried to go there.
Harriet Tubman rented a house in St. Catharines, Ontario.
This provided a shelter for new arrivals.
Harriet made about eleven trips from Canada to the U.S. during these years.
In all, she brought back about 300 people.
Escaped slaves had to travel by night and suffered hardships in bad weather.
They had to hide during the day wherever they could.
Harriet did not allow any passengers to turn back.
That might endanger the whole Underground Railway.
When the slave owners heard about Harriet, they offered a reward for her capture.
But no one caught her, or turned her in.
When the Civil War broke out in 1861,
she acted as a spy for the Northern States.
After the war, she married a black American soldier, Nelson Davis.
In 1869, a book was written about Harriet Tubman.
Black slaves knew Harriet as ""Moses"".
The Bible tells the story of how Moses led the people of Israel out of slavery in Egypt.
He led them north to Palestine.
In the same way, Harriet Tubman delivered many of her people from slavery and led them north to freedom.

249,249. Hernias repaired here!,C1,249-hernias-repaired-here,40,"A hernia occurs when there is a tear or weakness in the muscle layers of the abdomen.
This allows the intestines to push forward into the gap.
Usually the person feels some discomfort, and may notice an egg-shaped swelling.
In a few cases, the muscle layers may clamp down on the protruding intestine,
and cut off its oxygen supply.
This can result in death, if medical help is not readily available.
Hernias are more common in men than women,
and are often related to lifting heavy materials.
Although most hernias are not a serious threat to health,
they usually get worse over time.
The only cure is surgery to repair the cut, tear or weakness.
As with any surgery, time in hospital is usually required for recovery.
This proved to be a problem in Canada during World War II
Many young men were declared unfit for military service because they had hernias.
During the war, there was a shortage of doctors and beds for hernia repair.
A Toronto doctor, Dr. Edward Shouldice, decided to address this problem.
He personally operated on seventy of these young men, using a technique of his own.
This ""Shouldice Technique"" allowed the patients a quicker recovery time than the usual method.
It also had a much lower rate of complications and failures.
After the war, Dr. Shouldice opened his own hernia clinic for the public.
In 1953, a second hospital was started in Thornhill, just north of Toronto,
and today all surgery is done there.
The Shouldice Hospital is located on a beautiful piece of land with a valley on one side and a golf course on the other.
The large grounds have wonderful gardens and flowering trees.
There are nature paths for patients to walk on.
The building itself is not a regular hospital,
but more like a hotel or residence, where patients can play the piano,
shoot pool, play shuffleboard, or practice their putting.
The hospital now has 89 beds, and an average of 30 hernia operations are performed daily.
Since all the surgeons are specialists, their level of skill is very high,
and less than 1% of operations need to be corrected.
(The worldwide rate of failure is around 20%.)
For patients, the good news is that everything at the hospital is directed to repairing their hernia,
and aiding their recovery as quickly as possible.
The staff encourages its patients to walk and exercise within four or five hours of surgery.
Patients usually stay on for several more days, until they are fully recovered and ready to go home.
Shouldice's best advertisements are his satisfied customers.
Hernia patients come not only from Canada and the United States,
but also from many countries of the world to receive the best possible treatment.
Shouldice remains the most famous hospital in the world devoted entirely to the repair and treatment of hernias.

250,250. Julie Andrews,B1,250-julie-andrews,34,"Julie Andrews, born Julia Elizabeth Wells, was born on October 1st, 1935.
She lived in a small town called Walton-on-the-Thames in England, which is south of London.
Her father Ted Wells was a teacher, and mother Barbara was a pianist and piano teacher.
She also played piano for her sister's dancing school.
Julie learned ballet and tap as a toddler from her Aunt Joan Morris.
By the time Julie was three, she could read and write.
When Julie was four, her parents divorced,
and Barbara married Ted Andrews (a performer during the war and an excellent tenor).
He soon began giving Julie singing lessons.
At seven years of age, Julie had an unbelievable range of four octaves.
She soon changed her last name to ""Andrews"", the last name of her stepfather.
As she grew older, Julie became one of England's most popular performers.
In early childhood, Julie loved to play with her two younger half-brothers, but soon went on to stardom.
At age twelve, Julie was cast in a London play and stopped the show with her remarkable talent.
She starred in many different BBC productions during the forties.
Later, she starred in many Broadway plays such as The Boyfriend, My Fair Lady, and Camelot.
It was the latter play that Walt Disney made a special trip to New York to see,
and he decided then and there that Julie was perfect for the role of Mary Poppins in the film of the same name.
Mary Poppins was the high-spirited, magical nanny of Jane and Michael Banks, two small British children.
Julie also starred in many other films, such as The Americanization of Emily,
Hawaii, Thoroughly Modern Millie, and my personal favorite, The Sound of Music.
In this production she plays Maria, the lively governess of Austrian Naval Captain Georg von Trapp's seven children:
Liesl, Fredric, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta and Gretl.
Another of Julie's talents is writing.
Two of her best-known books are The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles, and Mandy.
Julie also has five children.
A daughter, Emma Kate Walton, from her marriage to Tony Walton;
four children from her second marriage to Blake Edwards,
two of whom were from Blake's previous marriage, Jennifer and Geoffrey;
and two who were adopted from Vietnam, Amy and Joanna.
In 1998, tragedy struck Julie.
She lost her extraordinary talent for singing due to surgery on her throat in order to remove a benign tumor.
A year later, she made an attempt to sing again; however, her voice will never be the same.
Julie has recently been on Britain's Royal honor List and is now a Dame.

251,251. Potato chips and corn chips,B2,251-potato-chips-and-corn-chips,47,"The story goes that the potato chip was invented in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1853.
Multi-millionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt complained to the chef that his fried potatoes were sliced too thickly.
Chef George Crum responded by slicing the potatoes paper thin and frying them in hot oil.
The potato chip became an instant success.
Many companies have made large profits on chips.
The most successful brands are associated with the Frito-Lay Company.
Herman W. Lay of Nashville, Tennessee, was selling potato chips from the back of his car in the early 1930s.
He soon became a successful distributor for a brand of potato chips, which were made in Atlanta, Georgia.
When that company ran into financial problems,
Lay arranged to buy them out.
It now became H. W. Lay and Company.
Meanwhile in Texas, Elmer Doolin was trying to sell chips made from corn dough.
This was an old Mexican recipe, which Doolin had found in San Antonio, Texas.
At first, these Fritos corn chips were made in Mr. Doolin's mother's kitchen.
It took a few years before they sold very well.
Mr. Doolin moved the company to Dallas and began to expand his market.
In 1945, he granted the H. W. Lay Co. the rights to make Fritos corn chip for the American southeast.
In 1961, the two companies merged to become Frito-Lay Inc.
In 1965, Frito-Lay merged with Pepsi to become PepsiCo. Inc.,
one of the largest snack food and beverage companies in the world.
In 2000, Frito-Lay sold 58% of all the snack chips in the U.S.A.
In Canada and the United States, Frito-Lay products had sales of $9.9 billion.
The most popular brand was Lay's potato chips,
followed by Doritos, Ruffles, Tostitos, Cheetos, and Fritos.
Internationally, Frito-Lay has 28% of the market worldwide.
That amounts to $5.9 billion annually.
Why are potato chips and corn chips so popular?
Well, they are versatile.
You can eat them by themselves or with a sandwich for lunch.
They can replace other forms of potatoes and corn.
They can also come in various flavors.
For example, potato chip flavors include ketchup,
salt and vinegar, barbeque, dill pickle and cheddar.
Potato chips can be thick or thin, ridged or flat, spicy or bland.
Chips can be made from many things besides potatoes.
There is corn dough and tortilla dough, of course.
But chips can also be made from sweet potatoes, parsnips, taro root, peppers and other vegetables.
One caution about potato chips is that they are not a good source of nutrition.
Parents who send their children to school with a bag of potato chips for lunch
need to remember that these are just a snack.
Because snack chips usually contain a lot of fat, they can also lead to weight gain.
It is better not to eat snack chips too often, and not to eat them instead of healthier foods.
In Canada nearly $2 billion is spent on snack foods every year
and half of this is spent on chips.
People are always looking for new flavors to try.
Spicy chips are gaining in popularity.
The snack chip industry just keeps on growing.

252,252. The Stratford Festival,B2,252-the-stratford-festival,43,"The Shakespearean festival in Stratford, Ontario, is one of the greatest theatrical festivals in the world.
This is the story of how this small town, which is far from any theatrical centers, became so important for drama.
For most of its history, Stratford was the county town for the local farming region.
It was also a railway center. But it was hardly known for the arts.
An Irishman who opened an inn there founded Stratford in 1832.
He called his roadhouse ""Shakespeare's Inn"", after England's great dramatist.
Soon the little town became known as Stratford, after the town in England where Shakespeare was born.
The local river was likewise called the Avon after the English river.
The little town grew gradually and became the local center for government and law.
Stratford people seemed to enjoy the association with Shakespeare.
Many streets were given Shakespearean names such as Arden Park,
Portia Boulevard, Romeo Street and Viola Court.
Local schools received names such as Hamlet Public School or Falstaff School.
There was still no attempt at Shakespearean theatre in Stratford, Ontario.
In 1913, the Canadian Pacific Railway threatened to take over the town.
They proposed a railway line running through the center of Stratford,
which would have taken over much of the town's parkland.
The townspeople voted down this proposal.
Instead, they expanded the parkland along the Avon River.
These parks were enhanced with gardens and, in 1918, a pair of swans was added.
These swans were an imitation of the swans on English rivers.
In 1950, it appeared that the railway would be closing some of its workshops in Stratford.
The town was looking for ideas that might lead to new employment opportunities.
This was when one citizen, Tom Patterson, suggested that the town sponsor a drama festival.
Patterson was able to get Irish director, Tyrone Guthrie, to come to Stratford in 1952.
Guthrie agreed to head up the 1953 season.
Everyone in Stratford pitched in to raise the necessary money and prepare the stage.
Since there was no time to put up a building, the plays were staged under a huge tent.
Two plays were put on during a six-week season, and with great success.
In 1957, a permanent theatre was built.
The Stratford season in 2001 runs for more than six months, from late April to early November.
There are fourteen plays in production at three different theatres.
Altogether there are 668 performances,
with a total attendance of 580,000 people.
About 40% of the audience comes from the United States.
Tom Patterson's plan to ease unemployment in Stratford has worked well.
The festival has helped to create nearly 6,000 jobs
and generate wages and salaries of $110 million annually.
In total, the festival brings about $170 million of revenue into the Stratford area.
Of course, to the audiences who come back every year
the main attraction is seeing some of the best Shakespearean theatre in the world.
The Stratford Festival Company is Canada's leading acting company,
and many of its actors have become internationally known.

253,253. The two cultures,B2,253-the-two-cultures,36,"In 1956, English writer and scientist C.P. Snow wrote an essay on ""The Two Cultures"".
By this, he meant that in the West there's a scientific culture and a literary culture.
Scientists do not talk very much to literary men and vice versa.
Neither group seems to know, or want to know, very much about the other.
Snow argues that the scientific people and the literary people are moving further and further apart.
Few scientists or engineers read literature;
very few writers or intellectuals know or care anything about science.
This, Snow thinks, is a major problem in the world today.
Literary culture seems to be anti-science and anti-technology.
This affects Western reluctance to train more scientists and engineers.
The standard of living in the West, and throughout the world, depends on having scientists and engineers.
Nonetheless, relatively little effort is given to encouraging and developing these areas of education.
Westerners, who are part of the literary culture, do not encourage or understand the scientific revolution.
As a result, they are insensitive to the desire of Third World peoples to improve their lives through technology.
Snow talks about how the standard of living in England has improved since 1800.
Snow's grandfather did not go far in school, but he did learn to read and write.
Living in 1900, he realized that he was better off than his grandfather who lived in the early 1800s.
Snow's great-great-grandfather was a farm laborer who didn't know how to read or write.
Snow feels that a similar transformation could happen even in very poor countries.
It could happen in a short time if the West supplied capital and engineers.
Snow believes that this is the industrial revolution that has transformed the West.
This is what has allowed the farm laborers to go on to school and to learn employable skills.
In 1800, only a small portion of society could expect to live well.
Now nearly everyone has access to education and training.
The same industrial revolution can happen in Third World countries.
It is the only way to improve the lot of the poor.
Snow agrees that most scientists and engineers do not read novels or cultivate the arts.
However, he doesn't consider this to be as dangerous as when literary people ignore science and technology.
Science and technology are too important to our standard of living to be ignored;
our education systems have to be changed to reflect our need of them.
Snow's article was quite controversial.
Not everyone agreed with him that science and technology are being ignored by our educational system.
But Snow certainly has a point when he says that scientific people and literary people view the world differently.
These two different mindsets often lead to conflict in the workplace.
Snow may be right that it is too easy for literary-minded students to ignore science,
and scientifically minded students to ignore literature.

254,254. The war that both sides won,C1,254-the-war-that-both-sides-won,48,"Today, the 3000 mile boundary between Canada and the United States is known as ""the longest undefended boundary in the world"".
But for three years in a row: 1812, 1813 and 1814, U.S. armies invaded Canada.
When both sides failed to win a clear victory,
and the costs of the war kept growing,
the two countries decided that peace was the best policy.
On June 18, 1812, the United States declared war on Great Britain.
The United States had proclaimed their independence from Britain in 1776, 36 years earlier.
There were still bad feelings between the two countries.
Great Britain was not treating the United States as an equal independent country.
British ships were stopping American ships from trading with Europe.
British sailors went aboard American ships looking for deserters from the British Navy.
If an American sailor could not prove that he was an American, he was taken to work for the British.
At the same time, the population of the United States was expanding.
Americans wanted to move west into lands held by various American Indian tribes.
Some Americans felt that Britain was encouraging the Indians to fight them and was supplying guns to the Indians.
In 1812, Canada was made up of a small number of British colonies just north of the American border.
Americans felt it would be easy to take over Canada;
then Canadian land would provide homes for their growing population.
Since Americans outnumbered Canadians ten to one
the U.S. government thought that no one in Canada would dare oppose them.
Moreover, Britain was fighting a terrible war in Europe against Napoleon, the Emperor of France,
and could not spare any troops to help defend Canada.
But, in 1812, Canada had one advantage over the U.S.A., good leadership.
British General Isaac Brock had served in Canada for ten years.
He knew how to inspire both his own soldiers and the ordinary people of Canada to fight for their country.
He was a bold and energetic leader who moved quickly to attack American positions before they could attack him.
Brock found a valuable ally in the American Indian Chief Tecumseh.
Tecumseh had been trying to unite the scattered groups of Indians to fight together against American expansion.
He convinced the Indians that their best chance for success was to join the British and Canadians against the Americans.
Although both Brock and Tecumseh were killed in battles,
their example continued to inspire the defenders of Canada to fight against the American invasions.
Before the end of 1814, all American forces had been driven out of Canada.
By 1814, Britain had defeated the French Emperor Napoleon.
Now it was the turn of the United States to be invaded.
A large British force attacked the heart of the United States,
and burned the government buildings at Washington.
Another British force attacked the U.S.A. near the mouth of the Mississippi River,
but it was defeated at the Battle of New Orleans.
Both sides were tired of fighting by this time,
and a peace treaty was signed on December 24, 1814.
This agreement restored everything to the way it had been when the war began.
Although this really meant that no one had won the war,
both sides claimed victory.
The Americans felt that they had gained full recognition of their independence.
Britain would no longer board their ships, or encourage the Indians to fight them.
Canadians felt that they had shown Americans
that they wanted to develop their own country in their own way, separate from the United States.
But the biggest result of the war was the decision by both countries never to fight each other again.

255,255. North American death and burial,B2,255-north-american-death-and-burial,59,"Most people in North America die either in hospital or at home.
When someone dies, arrangements are made with a funeral home to get the body and prepare it for burial.
Funeral homes are private businesses.
They usually handle most or all aspects of a funeral, except for providing the burial plot.
That usually has to be purchased separately.
Funeral homes may operate in many kinds of buildings.
Old roomy private homes and new modern one-level buildings are common types.
When the funeral director receives the body, his staff embalms it
so it will not decay quickly and will look lifelike at the funeral service.
For one or two days before the burial,
friends, relatives and acquaintances are invited to visit the funeral home
and pay their respects to the dead person.
The deceased person is usually dressed in their best clothes, and lying on their back in a coffin.
A coffin is a large wooden or metal chest designed to hold the body.
Members of the dead person's immediate family usually act as hosts for the funeral home visitation.
They greet the mourners and talk to them about the deceased.
Usually, there are happy photographs of the dead person near the coffin.
Gifts of flowers also surround the coffin.
Usually the mourners are asked to sign a guest book.
The funeral service may take place at a church, if the deceased person wanted that.
Frequently, however, the service is held at a chapel at the funeral home.
Attending a funeral is considered a sign of respect, and people will often travel a long distance to attend.
Usually friends and relatives will take a day off work for the occasion.
Notices are put in the newspaper for several days before, so that people will know when to come.
A minister or priest usually conducts the funeral service.
There will be hymns, prayers, and perhaps a sermon, like a regular church service.
Sometimes, the minister will speak at length about the dead person.
Sometimes, a member of the family does this.
Opportunity is allowed for other people to talk about their memories of the dead person.
At the end of the service, the coffin is wheeled out to a waiting car, called a hearse,
which drives the dead person to the burial place.
The mourners go to their cars and follow the hearse to the cemetery.
At the cemetery, a hole has already been dug to receive the coffin.
Usually there's a short ceremony at the grave.
Sometimes, flowers are put on top of the coffin as it is lowered into the grave.
A handful of soil is tossed on the coffin, indicating burial.
Usually the mourners leave before the cemetery workers cover the coffin with earth.
Then the mourners may go back to a church hall or restaurant for a meal.
A funeral can be quite costly.
Even an inexpensive coffin can be several thousand dollars.
Sometimes, the deceased will be placed in an expensive rental coffin for the visitation and funeral,
but buried in a less expensive coffin.
Even so, a full funeral rarely costs less than $5,000, and is usually quite a lot more.
This does not include the price of the burial plot or the stone grave marker.
Sometimes poor people are buried at government expense.
It is traditional in North America to bury the whole body in the ground.
However, cremation is becoming more popular.
The advantage of cremation is that it is less expensive, uses less land,
and it appeals to people who don't want an elaborate funeral.
Some people may wonder why so much attention is paid to a dead person.
But funerals are really for the living.
They are a way of saying goodbye to the dead person
and receiving mutual support and encouragement from friends and family.
Some funeral homes help to organize grief counselling or support groups to grieving family members.
Usually the funeral service is performed in the Christian tradition
and refers to the hope of resurrection or rebirth from the dead that Christians believe in.
It is now becoming common for people to plan their own funeral service before they die.
And usually attempts are made to make the service appropriate to the person who died.
This makes it more satisfying and memorable for family and friends.

256,256. Anastasia and the Russian Revolution,C1,256-anastasia-and-the-russian-revolution,58,"The twentieth century brought many changes to traditional cultures around the world.
Some of the most radical changes occurred in the Russian Empire,
which had one of the oldest monarchies in Europe.
In 1917-18 the rule of the Tsars was replaced by the world's first communist government led by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.
No one was more affected by these changes than Anastasia, the Tsar's youngest daughter.
Between 1895 and 1901, Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra,
became the parents of four beautiful and healthy daughters,
Olga, Tatiana, Marie and Anastasia.
However, since a girl could not inherit the throne of Russia,
it was important for Alexandra to give birth to a son.
Finally, in 1904, the Tsar and Tsarina had a son, Aleksei.
This event, which should have made the whole family very happy, proved to be a source of great sorrow.
Aleksei was soon found to have an incurable disease.
This disease, hemophilia, meant that Aleksei
regularly suffered from uncontrollable internal and external bleeding which left him very weak.
This caused anxiety for all the family, especially his mother and father.
The Tsar and Tsarina loved their children.
The girls, who didn't have to worry about becoming rulers, led a fairly carefree existence.
Anastasia and her sisters lived in a palace with hundreds of servants.
They attended many society parties with their parents.
The most elaborate parties were grand balls,
where everyone dressed in their finest clothes and danced all through the night.
The absolute rule of the Tsar was not popular with everybody.
The majority of the population was poor peasant farmers
who could barely keep themselves and their families alive.
If they moved into the city to get jobs in the factories,
they had to work long hours for very low wages, and live in slum conditions.
Popular opposition forced the Tsar in 1905 to give up some of his power to an elected parliament.
None of the girls married.
They all lived a happy life together.
They moved from palace to palace, attended by their private tutors,
visiting the beach, and sailing on the royal yacht.
Anastasia was the clown of the family.
She didn't like schoolwork, but she enjoyed painting and photography.
Many of her photos of the royal family in happy times survive.
Soon the Tsar's problems worsened.
The Empress Alexandra worried about her son and became ill.
War with Germany broke out in 1914,
and the Russians suffered many defeats and losses.
In March 1917, there was a popular revolution, and the Tsar was deposed.
From that time on, the royal family were prisoners.
At first, they were treated kindly,
but in November, the Bolsheviks or communists gained control of the revolution.
Lenin and his followers hated the Tsar.
The royal family had been living in Tobolsk in Siberia.
Because of fears that they might escape, they were brought back to Ekaterinburg in the Ural region.
Here, after midnight on June 19, 1918,
the entire royal family was shot by the Bolsheviks.
To some, this news was too dreadful to be believed.
The thought that the Tsar's lively and beautiful daughters had been killed was too hard to bear.
Within a couple of years, a woman who went by the name of Anna Anderson appeared in western Europe.
She claimed to be Anastasia.
Some believed her story and some did not.
With the fall of the Soviet Union, it was possible to investigate the murder of the royal family.
It was also possible to prove that Anna Anderson was not the real Anastasia.
After a long search, the bodies of Anastasia and Aleksei were found.
They had died with the rest of the family.
A great mystery was finally solved.

257,257. Australian origins,C1,257-australian-origins,54,"In many countries, leading families proudly trace their ancestors back to some significant group of people.
In the U.S.A., prominent families may boast that their family came over on the Mayflower in 1620.
In England, ladies and gentlemen are happy to announce that their ancestors
came to Britain with William the Conqueror in 1066.
In Australia, however, many leading families are reluctant to talk about their origins.
In fact, many years ago, one Australian city burned its early records,
so that no one would know who their ancestors were.
The reason for that is that Australia began its history as a British penal colony.
In eighteenth century England, there was a large gap between the rich and the poor.
To make matters worse, many farmers had been forced off their land by powerful landowners.
These homeless people wandered to the cities, where employment was often hard to find.
Frequent wars gave temporary employment to young men as soldiers and sailors,
but when the war was over, they were no better off than before.
As a result, theft was extremely common.
To protect themselves, the upper class made theft punishable by hanging.
The problem with this was that juries were often reluctant to hang someone for stealing something small,
and might declare the person ""not guilty"".
For example, if a man or woman stole a loaf of bread to feed their children, the jury might just let them go.
To prevent this, the courts came up with a new category of punishment, exile or ""transportation"".
If the judge or jury was reluctant to sentence the accused to death,
they would ship them far away from England across the seas.
However, if the person was found back in England again, he or she would be hanged.
At first, England sent its convicts to America's Thirteen Colonies.
However, when the United States declared its independence in 1776,
this was no longer possible. England considered sending criminals to West Africa,
but the land and climate were considered unsuitable.
So finally Great Britain decided to use the huge, almost uninhabited, country of Australia.
At this time, not a single European was living anywhere on the continent.
In the fall of 1786, a fleet of English ships began to take convicts on board.
This process continued till the sailing date of May 13, 1787.
Many British jails had been cleared of both male and female prisoners.
Since the convicts were technically under a sentence of death,
there was little concern for making them comfortable.
At first, the convicts were chained below decks,
but later some were released when well out to sea.
One man had been sentenced for theft of a winter coat;
another for stealing cucumbers from a garden;
a third for carrying off a sheep.
Among the women, one was guilty of stealing a large cheese;
another of taking several yards of cloth.
These ships known as ""The First Fleet""
carried 1,442 convicts, sailors, marines and officers.
The fleet finally arrived at Botany Bay on January 10, 1788.
Later that month, they moved down to Sydney Harbour.
No preparations whatsoever had been made.
The forests came right up to the shore.
Soon, the fleet members were cutting down trees and trying to put up tents.
It was June 1790 before further supplies arrived from England.
Meanwhile, many convicts suffered from sickness, aggravated by the lack of good food.
In conclusion, Australians need not be ashamed of their origins.
In time, great things were achieved, in spite of the almost complete lack of help from the English government.
Many ex-convicts became respectable settlers who began prosperous farms and businesses.
The members of the First Fleet, whether convicts or not,
deserve to be honored as the founders of Australia.

258,258. Casa Loma,B2,258-casa-loma,54,"Many people visit Europe and see the old castles left from the days of knighthood.
Very few return home with plans to build their own castle.
Toronto businessman Henry Pellatt actually built such a castle - Casa Loma.
Pellatt was born in Kingston, Ontario in 1859,
but the family soon moved to Toronto.
His father opened Toronto's first stock brokerage firm in 1866.
Pellatt Sr. became part of Toronto's financial elite.
And Henry Pellatt eventually joined his father in business.
The young Pellatt was especially attracted by the military and the British armed forces.
When Henry was 18, he joined the Queen's Own Rifles, a militia unit.
He was soon one of the soldiers sent to suppress a railway strike.
At 21, he was made an officer,
and gradually moved up through the ranks, eventually becoming a brigadier general.
Meanwhile, Henry was learning the stock brokerage business.
He soon showed considerable ability at forming new companies.
Electricity was a recent invention,
and Pellatt hoped to be among the foremost developers.
In 1883, he founded the Toronto Electric Light Company,
and later was an owner of the Toronto Electric Railway.
He also made money as a land speculator in the Canadian West.
Unlike many businessmen of the time, however,
Pellatt believed in community service.
He sponsored many charitable organizations and supported various good causes.
In spite of his business dealings, Pellatt found time to tour England and Europe regularly.
He brought back ideas for a ""castle on the hill"".
Pellatt's castle, however, would not be a damp, drafty castle of the Middle Ages.
It would have the latest technology.
Construction of ""Casa Loma"" began in 1910 and was completed in 1914.
Outwardly, it looked like a mediaeval castle, but inside it was comfortable and luxurious.
There were 98 rooms, three bowling alleys,
30 bathrooms, 25 fireplaces
and 5,000 electric lights.
It had an electric elevator and an indoor swimming pool.
There was a library of 100,000 books,
a temperature-controlled wine cellar,
a shooting gallery, and a large art collection.
Pellatt ordered only the most expensive materials and employed the best craftsmen.
The cost of all of this was $3.5 million, a huge sum in those days.
Pellatt and his wife liked to entertain.
They often opened up Casa Loma for special events.
Sometimes, he would invite all 1,000 men from the Queen's Own Rifles over for the weekend.
The Pellatts also held parties for the staff.
Pellatt had hoped that Casa Loma would be the center of an extensive subdivision.
He hoped that wealthy people would build grand homes nearby,
and so he bought up the land near his castle.
Unfortunately for Pellatt,
most of the people coming to Toronto were poor immigrants who couldn't afford large houses.
Pellatt was unable to sell his land holdings, and his income declined.
In 1924, Pellatt turned Casa Loma over to the City of Toronto because he could not pay his property tax.
All the contents of Casa Loma went on auction soon after.
His $1.5 million collection of art and artifacts sold for only $250,000.
Now Casa Loma is a leading Toronto tourist attraction.
""The castle in the middle of the city"" has 400,000 visitors each year.
It is the closest thing in North America to a real European castle.

259,259. Conquering Lake Ontario,B2,259-conquering-lake-ontario,48,"In 490 B.C. the Greek runner Phidippides ran the 24 miles from Marathon to Athens to announce the Athenian victory.
His endurance was so much admired that runners ever since have attempted to run similar long ""Marathon"" distances.
In the twentieth century, however, long distance swimming has also attracted attention and admiration.
To swim the English Channel or Juan de Fuca Strait between Vancouver Island and the mainland
have become challenges for both male and female swimmers.
In September 1954, some Canadian businessman from Toronto offered veteran Californian champion Florence Chadwick
$10,000 if she could swim Lake Ontario.
They felt sure that such a feat would attract large crowds.
Chadwick had swum the English Channel in both directions.
However, no one - neither man nor woman - had crossed Lake Ontario.
It was a 32-mile swim through cold water and difficult currents.
Two other women also decided to take up the challenge.
One, Winnie Roach Leuszler, had also swum the English Channel.
The other was a 16 year old girl named Marilyn Bell.
The swimmers traveled to the mouth of the Niagara River on the south side of Lake Ontario.
They would swim from Youngstown, in the U.S.A., back to Toronto.
Bad weather delayed the swim for several days.
During the night of September 8th the weather cleared,
and the swimmers entered the water before midnight.
Guided by her coach's flashlight, Marilyn swam through the dark water and soon passed Chadwick,
who was lifted from the water after swimming 12 miles.
Leuszler made it further, but she too eventually had to give up.
Marilyn not only had to overcome her fears of the dark,
but she was attacked during the night by blood-sucking lamprey eels.
She was able to knock these off with her fist.
As dawn approached, the winds and waves increased, and Marilyn's weariness mounted.
Her coach, Gus Ryder, passed her some corn syrup on a stick,
and later gave her liniment for her tired legs.
He wrote messages on a blackboard to encourage her to keep going.
Sometimes, he tricked her into thinking that she was nearer to the shore than she was.
Marilyn fell asleep in the water twice and had to be awakened.
The second time, a friend of hers jumped into the water beside her, and swam with her for a distance.
Because Marilyn's strength was declining, she was being pushed off course by the currents.
Although the direct route was 32 miles, Marilyn swam a total of 45 miles.
The last few miles were extremely difficult.
Marilyn's family and the lifeguards felt that she should be taken out of the water.
But her coach threatened to quit as her coach if the swimmer gave up.
It was getting dark again, and the swimmer was barely conscious as she approached the shore.
Thousands of people lined the shore hoping to touch her or get a picture of her.
Marilyn's supporters had to push the crowds back so they wouldn't stop her from touching the shore.
Finally, after 21 hours in the water, Marilyn reached land.
The exhausted girl was rushed to an ambulance.
She had lost about 20 pounds of her 120 pounds weight in the crossing.
Finally she was able to sleep.
Huge crowds came out to see her the next day,
and two days later there was a parade in her honor through the streets of Toronto.
Everyone admired the courage and endurance of the 16-year-old girl,
who became the first person to swim across Lake Ontario.

260,260. Currier and Ives,B2,260-currier-and-ives,51,"Before the widespread use of photography, there was a large market for artistic depictions of scenes and events.
A process for making prints called lithography became popular in North America during the early nineteenth century.
One young artist who mastered this technique was Nathaniel Currier (1813 to 1888).
Currier opened his own shop in 1834.
Currier's success came when he issued prints of newsworthy events.
His ""Ruins of the Merchant's Exchange"" followed a great fire in New York, December 1834.
One of Currier's prints of a disastrous fire on a steamboat was published in the New York Sun in 1840.
There was also a large market for decorative prints.
People who couldn't afford oil paintings would buy color prints to put on their walls.
Some of these prints were copies of paintings.
Sometimes, Currier mentioned his source and sometimes not.
In 1852, James Merritt Ives (1824-1895) joined Currier's firm.
In 1857, he became Currier's partner.
After that, the firm was known as Currier and Ives.
Altogether the firm produced about 7,000 different subjects.
Small prints sold for about 25 cents,
and large color prints for about $3.
Travelling salesmen went from house to house selling them.
Currier and Ives sometimes hired the original painters to make the print.
More often, someone from their own studio either composed an original subject or copied an existing painting or drawing.
Contemporary news remained popular.
Currier and Ives prints included ""The First Appearance of Jenny Lind in America"" (1850),
""The Fall of Richmond, Virginia"" (1865),
and ""The Great Fire at Chicago"" (1871).
A common subject was a patriotic scene from American history.
Interesting occupations such as whaling,
bird hunting, trapping, fur trading and deep-sea fishing were portrayed.
Pioneer and Indian topics were in demand.
However, the most popular of all scenes were winter and holiday prints of ordinary people enjoying life.
Farm scenes, buggy rides, sleigh rides,
market scenes, blacksmith's shops,
and town scenes sold well.
favorite prints included ""American Forest Scene: Maple Sugaring"" (1860),
""Home to Thanksgiving"" (1863),
""Winter in the Country"" (1862),
""Life in the Country: The Morning Ride"" (1859)
and ""American Winter Sports"" (1856).
These scenes are still popular.
Even today you can buy Christmas cards with Currier and Ives winter scenes.
This collection of prints gives a remarkable picture of America between 1934 and 1907.
Although the prints are sometimes more romantic than reality,
they give a lot of information about everyday life.
They depict styles of clothing, trains and boats,
buildings and bridges and popular activities.
They also tell us what sorts of scenes people at that time liked,
and what their artistic tastes were.
Eventually, advances in photography made this kind of printmaking obsolete.
In 1906, the firm of Currier and Ives closed its doors.
For a while, these prints were not considered very valuable.
Nowadays, however, there are many collectors,
and Currier and Ives prints once again can be found decorating North American homes.

261,261. Death Valley California,B2,261-death-valley-california,34,"The steep mountains of southeastern California dip suddenly into a deep valley.
Rain is kept out of the valley by the high mountains, which form its western slopes.
Although mountains surround the valley, Death Valley itself is very low.
In fact, its lowest point is 282 feet below sea level,
the lowest point of land in North or South America.
Death Valley is about 140 miles long, but only a few miles wide.
It got its name in 1849 during the California Gold Rush.
Gold seekers attempted to cross Death Valley on the way to California's gold fields,
and some died of thirst there.
There's hardly any water in the Valley.
The average rainfall is only a couple of inches a year.
It is also one of the hottest places in North America in the summer.
Temperatures of 134 fahrenheit have been recorded.
As a result of this heat and dryness, Death Valley is a desert.
These conditions give rise to the Valley's most important products - mineral salts and salt deposits.
One of these products is borax, which has many industrial uses.
Borax was removed from the desert using 20 mule teams hitched in a long string.
Later, a railway was built to help carry out these minerals.
In spite of its desert conditions, Death Valley has considerable animal and plant life.
Of course, its animals and plants are those typical in desert conditions.
Only on the salt flats do plants refuse to grow.
With even a small rainfall in the spring, the desert will come alive with wild flowers.
Very few places in the world have such a contrast in heights and depths.
The mountains near the Valley are among the highest in Continental U.S.A.,
while the Valley itself is the lowest elevation.
Mount Whitney at 14,495 feet is less than 100 miles from Death Valley.
The climate in the Valley from October to May is generally pleasant.
Since Death Valley is now a national park, many tourists visit during this season.
Now roads and hotels provide comfortable access.
Death Valley is located close to the Nevada border.
Its desert conditions are common throughout the area of the American west just east of the coastal mountains.
In most cases, heavy rain falls along the coast, but very little in the interior.
Because there is no farming and water is hard to obtain,
Death Valley and similar desert areas have very few permanent residents.

262,262. Dr Norman Bethune,B2,262-dr-norman-bethune,55,"Some people find their vocation early in life;
others do not discover their life's work until they are older.
Norman Bethune tried many things before he fully recognized his true work.
Bethune was born in Gravenhurst, Ontario in 1890.
He was the son of a Presbyterian clergyman.
The family moved frequently, and many of the places they lived were close to lakes, rivers and woods.
As a young man, Norman loved the outdoors.
He became a good swimmer and skater.
He also showed that he had a strong independent streak.
He hated rules, but also had a strong sense of justice.
The young man studied science at the University of Toronto from 1909 to 1911.
After that, he worked for Frontier College.
This was a volunteer organization where instructors did the same jobs as local workers during the day,
and taught them English in the evening.
He then returned to Toronto to study medicine.
Early in World War I, he joined the Army Medical Corps.
He reached France in February 1915,
but was wounded in April and eventually returned to Canada.
He went back to the war in 1917.
At the end of the war, he continued to study medicine in London, England.
While he was in England, he married a Scottish woman, Frances Campbell Penney.
Although Bethune loved her very much, their marriage ended in divorce in 1927.
The couple moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1924 where Bethune opened a medical practice.
In the middle of his growing success, he contracted tuberculosis.
This was a low point in Bethune's life.
Thinking that he was going to die, he considered suicide.
One day, however, he read of a new treatment for tuberculosis
and insisted that his doctors perform the operation on him.
As a result, Bethune recovered. The year was 1927.
For some years after, Bethune devoted himself to the treatment of tuberculosis patients.
However, he began to notice a pattern.
Rich patients who could afford proper medical care usually recovered.
Poor patients usually died.
Bethune became a supporter of government-funded medical care.
Bethune admired the government-funded health system in communist Russia.
He was angry when Canada would not support his idea about Medicare.
Bethune wanted to change the world, and communism seemed like the most promising method.
In 1936, Bethune went to Spain to help the Republicans fight the Fascists.
He was appalled to see the Fascists' allies, Germany and Italy, dropping bombs on women and children.
He developed a hatred for Fascism.
He also decided that doctors should go to the front, rather than wait for the wounded to be brought to them.
In Spain, he developed a blood transfusion service, which saved many lives.
Returning to North America, Bethune heard about the Japanese attack on China in 1937.
Early in 1938, he sailed for China.
Bethune had joined the Communist Party.
Now he went to join the army of Mao Tse-sung in Northern China.
Mao's army was suffering badly from Japanese attacks.
They had hardly any doctors or medical supplies.
Difficulties only made Bethune work harder.
He soon organized a hospital, trained medical workers, and wrote textbooks.
He insisted on operating right at the front to give the wounded a better chance of survival.
He went for days without sleep and gave his own blood to help the wounded.
In November 1939, he died from blood poisoning.
But his work lived on.
In 1973, the Canadian government bought his house that he was born in and turned it into a museum.

263,263. Ebenezer Scrooge,B1,263-ebenezer-scrooge,61,"In the story ""A Christmas Carol"", Scrooge is an English businessman who thinks about nothing but money.
He has no friends, and spends no time with his family.
He lives alone, eats alone, and works alone, except for his underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit.
Scrooge never spends his money, but hoards it all, and prides himself on his frugality.
Scrooge hates Christmas. It's all nonsense to him.
People spend money on food, and gifts, and parties.
Often they can't afford what they spend.
Worse than that, they take a whole day off work and so lose a chance to make more money.
Scrooge is angry that he has to give his clerk the day off with pay.
He feels that he's being robbed.
Christmas is also a time when people are asked to give money to help the poor.
Scrooge is angry when two men come to his door asking for donations.
Scrooge argues that he pays taxes, which support prisons and workhouses.
It is not his business to worry about the problems of other people.
Scrooge represents businessmen who see the ""bottom line"" as all that matters.
Scrooge's partner Marley had died seven years earlier.
He was like Scrooge in all respects.
That evening, which is Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by Marley's ghost.
Marley drags steel chains round about him, which contain keys, cash-boxes, ledgers, purses and deeds.
These are the things that Marley cared about when he was alive.
Marley is condemned in death to wander the world and tells Scrooge that the same fate is likely to happen to him.
However, three spirits will visit Scrooge, and if Scrooge listens to them, he may escape his fate.
The first spirit comes and takes Scrooge back to the early scenes of his own life.
He sees himself being left behind at school while the other boys went home for the holidays.
Then his little sister arrives to tell him he could go home too.
Another scene was of a cheerful Christmas party, when Scrooge was a young man.
A third scene showed him with the girl he was planning to marry.
She left him because he no longer cared about anything but money.
The second spirit shows Scrooge what people are doing that very Christmas.
He shows Scrooge the preparations that people, even poor people, are making to celebrate Christmas.
They visit Bob Cratchit's tiny home.
There they see the family cooking their little Christmas dinner.
Bob's son, Tiny Tim, has been weakened by disease, and has to use a crutch to walk.
The family is delighted with its meal, small as it is.
They see other scenes of poor people, miners and sailors, celebrating Christmas.
Finally, they visit Scrooge's nephew, and view his Christmas party and its games.
The third spirit was the spirit of Christmas Yet to Come, the Future.
This spirit does not talk but points to scenes connected with Scrooge.
They overhear some businessmen joking about someone who has recently died,
Scrooge sees that he no longer occupies his usual place of business.
The spirit then shows him two women who have stolen the bedclothes, curtains, and clothes of the dead man
and taken them to a pawnbroker.
The spirit takes Scrooge to the room where the dead man died.
The only people who are happy about the death are a young couple who owed him money.
The spirit then shows Scrooge the Cratchit's house, where they're mourning the death of Tiny Tim.
Finally, the spirit takes him to a churchyard, where they stand among the graves.
Then the spirit points to the name of the dead man on the tombstone, ""Ebenezer Scrooge"".
Scrooge is going to die, and no one will care.
Scrooge finds himself in his own bed on Christmas morning.
He is resolved now to avoid the fate that the spirits had shown him.
He is delighted that he is getting a second chance.
Scrooge decides to surprise all his acquaintances,
and he begins by buying a huge goose and sending it to the Cratchits.
On his walk, he meets the two men collecting for the poor, and offers them a large sum of money.
He goes on to join his nephew at a Christmas party.
The next day when Bob Cratchit comes into work, Scrooge gives him a raise in his salary.
He also takes care of Tiny Tim, so that Tim recovers his health.
Charles Dickens' story was written at a time when governments did very little to help the poor.
Wages were very low, and many businessmen were unwilling to look after their workers properly.
Dickens points out that people like Scrooge not only make other people unhappy, but also are usually unhappy themselves.
It is possible to be a very rich businessman, and a poor human being at the same time.

264,264. Etiquette,B2,264-etiquette,45,"""Etiquette"" is a French word. The original meaning was ""little tickets"".
These tickets were given to people who were attending a public ceremony.
Printed on the ticket were instructions about how to behave on this occasion.
So etiquette came to mean the way to behave on public occasions.
Etiquette today includes how to introduce people;
how to eat properly; how to dress for different occasions;
how to speak to different people; and what to do on special occasions.
Almost every part of social life can have its particular etiquette.
Sometimes, etiquette changes or seems to change.
There was much behavior attached to courtship, such as a man holding the door open for a woman.
Nowadays, some people find this outdated.
But politeness is always a good idea.
It is nice to hold the door open for the next person, whoever they are.
In fact, it sometimes seems like contemporary life encourages bad manners.
Etiquette is no longer taught to young people.
Moreover, in a youth culture, young people take their examples from other young people.
As a result, good manners aren't considered important.
The point of etiquette is to help people to get along with each other.
If people behave in an accepted manner,
there is less chance of misunderstanding.
It is important for people to think about treating other people well.
If everyone does what they feel like doing, it doesn't seem like they respect other people.
Etiquette can help things to go a lot smoother.
Manners vary from culture to culture, but the intention is the same:
to treat people with consideration.
This is a way to reduce conflict.
Sometimes, we can understand where these customs come from.
Originally, shaking hands with your right hand probably meant that you weren't carrying a weapon.
Taking off your hat may originally have been taking off your helmet.
This meant that you weren't going to fight.
Nowadays, there are new areas of social life.
For example, a lot of conversation now takes place on the telephone.
Perhaps because there is no traditional telephone etiquette, some people feel free to be rude.
Try to treat the person on the phone just the way you would treat them if you were actually talking to them.
Most people feel it is rude to interrupt a conversation.
But many people seem to think that it is okay to interrupt someone talking on the phone.
Children especially need to be taught not to interrupt.
The Internet also needs its own etiquette or ""netiquette"".
Because you cannot see whom you are talking to, and they may be thousands of miles away, it is easy to misunderstand.
Also people cannot hear the tone of your voice over the Internet.
For this reason, some people use ""smilies"" - little faces, to show how they are feeling.
If they make a joke they can use a smiling face, or print *grin* after their remark.
This tips off the recipient that their remark is not to be taken seriously.
Using simple words like ""please"" and ""thank you"" can make everyday life a lot smoother and happier.
Like a lot of other things, we do not realize the importance of etiquette until it starts to disappear.

265,265. Gambling,C1,265-gambling,38,"Many governments have turned to legalized gambling as a way to increase revenues.
Raising taxes has become very unpopular, and gambling can be seen as a ""cash cow"".
Large casinos are often considered good for areas with high unemployment.
Most new casinos include a variety of slot machines, table games, such as blackjack, and roulette wheels.
Opponents of gambling point to problems associated with it.
Crime rates go up, especially with respect to theft and prostitution.
People become addicted to gambling and play until they are broke.
Stress is put on families when one member gambles, and the grocery and rent money are spent.
On the other hand, many people view gambling as an exciting form of entertainment.
They look forward to the opportunity to play the lottery or go to the casino.
Often they feel that they are getting good value, in terms of entertainment, for what they spend.
The truth is probably that some people can control the urge to gamble, while some cannot.
People who find gambling really exciting feel that they have to go back for that ""high"",
even if it means spending all their money.
Many people doubt that governments should promote gambling, since it is certain to produce addicts.
There has also been some question whether gambling is good for the local economy.
If a casino is built in an area of high unemployment, will local people really benefit?
The answer seems to be both yes and no.
People may benefit if the gamblers come in large numbers from outside the area and spend their money there.
That is, if the casino is a notable tourist attraction.
On the other hand, if not many people come from outside the area, there are few benefits.
In this case, most of the gamblers are local people who are spending the little money they have.
Gambling is especially attractive to older and retired people.
Since older people don't have much chance of making a lot of new money,
the thought of winning the jackpot is very attractive to them.
Casinos regularly run buses from retirement homes so that seniors can come and gamble.
Some would see this as taking advantage of lonely people.
There are stories in the newspaper about couples leaving their children locked in the car for six or eight hours while they gamble.
One man hoped to improve his finances by gambling, but he lost heavily.
His wife found out and went gambling herself, hoping to win some of the money back.
Before long, they had to sell their house to pay their gambling debts.
Gambling has usually been associated with organized crime.
Even today, when government agencies supervise gambling, it would appear that there is still a crime connection.
This may be because many of the best gamblers and gambling administrators learned their trade outside of the law.
Besides this, gambling establishments attract various forms of crime to the area.
Since law and government have an important educational function, one doesn't like to see them involved in gambling.
Governments should be more than profit-maximizers.
They should be concerned chiefly with the public good.

266,266. Gilbert and Sullivan,B2,266-gilbert-and-sullivan,54,"Gilbert and Sullivan are the authors of many lively and humorous operettas.
These works are the most popular of their kind, and are regularly performed today.
But the two authors are known almost as well for their arguments and disagreements.
The famous partners were very different people with very different interests.
William S. Gilbert wrote the words that Sullivan set to music.
Gilbert had a special talent for humorous verse.
He loved puns, and had a very quick wit.
Personally though, he was very businesslike.
He had wanted to enter the military and always had the look of a soldier about him.
He was fond of giving orders and disliked criticism of anything he did.
Arthur S. Sullivan, on the other hand, was a sensitive, emotional person,
whose main interest was music.
Sullivan came from a poor family, but his musical talents and good looks had helped him to succeed.
Sullivan wanted to write serious classical music.
But, as a poor man, he needed a source of income.
Sullivan also needed someone to direct him.
On his own, he had trouble deciding what to do.
Gilbert and Sullivan never became really good friends
and, at the end of their lives, they had little contact with each other.
But the writer and musician needed each other.
Gilbert needed a composer who could enliven his writings for the stage.
Sullivan needed someone to write a text for his music.
Sullivan, who tended to be lazy, needed someone to push him.
A theatrical manager named Richard D'Oyly Carte arranged their first collaboration.
Gilbert visited Sullivan and read him his satire on the legal system, ""Trial by Jury"".
Sullivan loved the piece and quickly wrote the music.
""Trial by Jury"" was produced in 1875 and became the first triumph for the partners.
D'Oyly Carte decided to form an acting company, which would stage future works by Gilbert and Sullivan.
A string of successes follows:
""The Sorcerer"" in 1877;
""H. M. S. Pinafore"" in May 1878;
""The Pirates of Penzance"" in December 1878;
""Patience"" in 1881;
""Iolanthe"" in 1882;
""The Mikado"" in 1885;
""The Yeomen of the Guard"" in 1888;
and ""The Gondoliers"" in 1889.
In spite of these successes, the two partners were not happy.
Sullivan did not like the way Gilbert dominated their relationship.
Sullivan had to write music for Gilbert's scripts.
Why couldn't Gilbert write words for Sullivan's music?
Gilbert, on the other hand, thought that Sullivan got the most of the credit for the success of their operettas and that he was overlooked.
Gilbert was the driving force in the relationship.
He was always writing new scripts and taking them to Sullivan.
It was Gilbert who rehearsed the actors and supervised the productions.
Sullivan had little to do with the actual performance.
He usually did conduct the orchestra on opening night.
The amazing thing is how these two different people produced such wonderful work.
Each separately had difficulty writing something that the public wanted.
Together they were unbeatable.
Gilbert's sharp and often cutting remarks were made acceptable by Sullivan's beautiful music.
Gilbert's satire might have made people angry, but Sullivan's music calmed them down.
Even when the English people were the targets of Gilbert's criticisms,
the audience went out of the theatre humming these criticisms to Sullivan's music.

267,267. Hawaii,B1,267-hawaii,46,"In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, far from any land, there are the Hawaiian Islands.
These islands are the tops of a chain of volcanic mountains.
Two volcanoes on the Island of Hawaii are still active.
There are five larger islands.
Kauai is to the west; Oahu, Molokai and Maui are in the middle; and Hawaii is to the east.
There are three smaller islands.
Hawaii is the largest island of the group, but Oahu has the largest population.
The capital city, Honolulu, is on Oahu.
Since the Hawaiian Islands are so far from any land,
one might wonder how people arrived there.
The answer is that the first Hawaiians were very good sailors.
They travelled thousands of miles from other islands in the Pacific in canoes.
To keep these canoes stable in the ocean, they attached an ""outrigger"", or pontoon, to the main canoe.
Sometimes, they fastened two canoes together and put a wooden platform on top.
Then they could carry lots of people and supplies.
The first Hawaiians were Polynesians,
and probably came from the Marguesas and Tahiti in the South Pacific.
They were a tall good-looking people.
Their kings made rules about how their people should live,
and priests and advisors called ""kahunas"" enforced these.
Today the phrase ""the big kahuna"" means someone who is, or thinks he is, very important.
Although Hawaii lies within the tropics, it has a very mild climate.
Sea breezes keep the weather from getting too hot, even in the summer.
Many edible plants grow in abundance there.
So it was not difficult for the Hawaiians to live very comfortably without working hard.
Captain Cook was the first European to reach Hawaii in 1778.
Soon European and American ships visited there regularly.
The sailors also brought diseases formerly unknown.
By 1853, the population had dropped to 73,000 from about 300,000 when Cook visited in 1778.
Besides Europeans, people from China, Japan and the Philippines came to live there.
Soon large plantations of sugar cane and pineapples developed.
As more and more land came under western control, the native monarchy was undermined.
American plantation owners were able to arrange for United States' control of the islands.
Today, the largest industry is tourism.
Since the climate is good all year round, visitors can come at any time.
When you arrive, a young Hawaiian woman will greet you.
She will put a beautiful flower necklace called a ""lei"" around your neck.
Hula dancers entertain tourists.
Hula dancers wear skirts made of long leaves.
Each dancer tells a story by moving their arms and hands in a certain way.
For meals, the Hawaiians like to dig a pit in the ground, place wood in the pit, and then set the wood on fire.
Food wrapped in leaves is then placed on the wood, and the pit is covered with leaves and mats.
A feast cooked this way is called a ""luau"".
These traditions nowadays are usually performed for tourists, or on special holidays.
Hawaii is the 50th state of the United States,
and its people enjoy all the advantages of the modern world.

268,268. Henry Ford,B1,268-henry-ford,47,"Some inventions are based on simple ideas or principles.
Barometers are based on the idea that air has weight and pushes down on objects.
A barometer measures this air pressure.
Evangelista Terricelli invented barometers in Italy in 1643.
Other inventions have taken longer to develop.
The automobile has thousands of parts and it took a long time to make a really useful car.
Henry Ford was one of the first people to make a reliable automobile.
In 1765, James Watt invented the steam engine.
Within a few years, a Frenchman, Nicolas Cugnot, had built a steam-powered vehicle.
These steam carriages were used in England in the 1800s. But they were big and slow.
They looked like a train without the tracks.
Most people preferred to travel by train.
In Germany during the 1870s and 1880s,
Nikolaus Otto and Gottlieb Daimler
developed the internal combustion engine.
This ran by burning gasoline.
Another German, Karl Benz, built a gasoline-powered car.
Around the world, there were many inventors trying to build a car that would be better than the one before.
Some people thought that electric cars would become common.
In the 1890s, several inventors working in the United States developed a gasoline-powered car that was practical for daily use.
Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863.
As a boy, he loved to take clocks and watches apart and reassemble them.
Eventually, he went to work for the Detroit Edison Company.
In his spare time, he worked on a ""horseless carriage"", as the early cars were called.
In 1896, he completed a car that ran smoothly.
He later sold it and made another one.
Since early cars were made by hand, they were usually quite expensive.
Not only that, but when they broke down, there were no repair shops to take them to.
One had to know how to repair a car oneself.
Henry Ford tried to make cars which would be affordable, and which would not break down very easily.
His Ford Motor Company was formed in 1903 in Detroit, Michigan.
Since many parts had to be brought together to make a car, Ford developed the assembly line.
On the line, each worker would do one specific job.
When the car reached the end of the assembly line, it was finished.
In this way, many cars could be made in a single day.
The result was that Ford was able to bring the price of cars down.
Ford's ""Model T"" car was advertised as being ""as frisky as a jack rabbit and more durable than a mule"".
Since it cost hundreds, rather than thousands, of dollars,
many ordinary families were now able to buy a car.
Once many people had cars, their habits began to change.
People didn't have to live next to the factories or offices that they worked in.
Going for Sunday drives or travelling to tourist sites became a common thing.
In 1905, a car drove across the United States and back again.
In 1912, a car went across Canada from coast to coast.
Soon there was public pressure for good roads so that cars could travel anywhere in North America.
Henry Ford was not the only inventor of the modern car.
However, he was able to make a car that everyone could use and afford.

269,269. John Chapman American Pioneer,B1,269-john-chapman-american-pioneer,58,"When the first Europeans came to North America, they found dense forests coming down right to the shore.
So thick were the forests that it was said
that a squirrel could travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River without once touching the ground.
Clearing these trees to make room for fields and buildings was a very difficult task for the early settlers.
Another difficulty was finding enough food in this new land.
Many European crops could not grow in this climate.
Carrying and storing seeds over a long period was also risky.
Native Indians were often helpful in teaching the settlers how to find food.
But sometimes there were no Indians nearby, or they were hostile.
John Chapman is famous today because he helped the early settlers grow one important product,
Apples! Apples could be eaten fresh in the fall, or stored through the winter.
They could be made into fresh apple juice or alcoholic cider.
They could be dried, or made into applesauce.
Apples also could be made into vinegar, which is very useful for keeping vegetables from spoiling.
John Chapman was born in Massachusetts in 1774, the year before the American Revolution began.
John's father joined George Washington's army to fight for American independence from Great Britain.
While the war was going on, John's mother died.
In 1870, John's father married again, and soon John had lots of younger brothers and sisters.
John probably worked on his father's farm as he was growing up.
Then he worked on neighboring farms.
It may be at this time that John began to learn about apples.
After the Revolutionary War, the population of the U.S.A. was expanding.
Many Americans wanted to go west over the mountains to find land in Indian Territory.
In the fall of 1797, young John Chapman headed west to Pennsylvania.
On his way, he gathered leftover apple seeds from the cider mills that he passed.
As usual, John walked barefoot, but as he travelled snow began to fall.
He tore strips off his coat and tied them around his feet.
Then he made snowshoes out of tree branches.
When he arrived in the west, he began to clear land and plant apple seeds.
This began a pattern that would last Chapman's whole life.
He would travel ahead of the settlers, clear land,
and then sell his baby apple trees to the settlers when they arrived.
When the area became too settled, Chapman would move further west, and start again.
Many settlers regarded John Chapman as a strange character.
He never bought new clothes, but wore whatever old clothes came his way.
But he was always welcome at a settler's cabin.
John was good at clearing land, telling stories, and growing apples.
He liked children, and children liked him.
He was a religious man and would read to the settlers about God and living together peacefully.
At this time, there was conflict between the settlers and Indians about land.
John managed to be friendly with both groups.
But John did warn the settlers if the Indians were planning to attack them.
Every fall, John went east to gather more apple seeds.
He would then go further west and find some empty land to plant his seeds.
During the warm weather, he tended all his fields of baby apple trees.
Once they were properly grown, he sold the seedlings to settlers.
When he had earned enough money, he bought land to grow more apple trees.
In his own lifetime, he became known as Johnny Appleseed.
Legends grew up about him.
It was said that his bare feet could melt snow, and that he could leap across rivers.
Johnny Appleseed never built himself a real home.
He was a wanderer all his life, travelling west to Indiana and Iowa and back east again.
He enjoyed sleeping outdoors, lying on his back,
looking up at the stars and thinking about God and his world.
He died in Indiana in 1845,
and no one knows exactly where he's buried.
But all through that region are hundreds of apple trees.
These apple trees are the most fitting memorial to John Chapman: the legendary Johnny Appleseed.

270,270. Las Vegas Nevada,B1,270-las-vegas-nevada,42,"Nevada is a large state of deserts and mountains.
Since most of the land is not suitable for farming, the population grew very slowly.
In the 1950s, there were only 267,000 people in the entire state.
Now, there are nearly a million people living in the Las Vegas area alone.
Las Vegas has become a major tourist center.
It used to be quite a little desert town of the old west.
But in the 1950s and 1960s, hotels and gambling casinos were opened.
In order to bring tourists to town, these hotels hired well-known entertainers.
Soon Las Vegas became known as a major entertainment center.
In order to promote the growth of Nevada, some activities were allowed which were against the law in other states.
These included gambling and prostitution.
It was also easier to get married in Nevada than in some other states.
Over time, many other attractions were developed.
Much of the activity in Las Vegas goes on at some 30 major hotels.
Many of these hotels provide a complete range of services and entertainment.
Some of them boast 4,000 or 5,000 rooms.
It is common for these large hotels to be organized around a particular theme,
such as the Middle Ages, the Arabian Nights, the movies, the circus, Paris, Egypt or the Far East.
The hotel, its restaurants, shops, lounges and entertainment reflect this theme.
For example, the Paris Las Vegas Hotel has a 50-storey replica of the Eiffel Tower.
The Luxor Hotel has a huge image of an Egyptian Sphinx and a replica of the tomb of King Tut.
Nearly all of the major hotels also contain a casino, sometimes several casinos.
Gambling is a major reason why people come to Las Vegas.
There are slot machines, blackjack tables, and roulette wheels and much more.
Even though Las Vegas is in the desert, there is an extravagant use of water.
Large swimming pools, water slides, artificial waterfalls and huge fountains are common.
Health spas, beauty salons, fashion boutiques, specialty restaurants and malls abound.
Tennis and golf are also popular.
The lavish shows at Las Vegas are world famous.
Tall dancing showgirls, like the famous Rockettes, wear beautiful but rather skimpy costumes.
Some entertainers, like singer Wayne Newton, rarely leave Las Vegas.
The pay there is good, and the audiences are appreciative.
Near Las Vegas are other tourist sites such as the giant Hoover Dam.
Behind the Hoover Dam is the large artificial lake, Lake Mead.
Further up the river is the Grand Canyon.
All these things are a short trip from the city.
Las Vegas is called the city that never sleeps.
At nearly any time of the day or night, there are casinos and shows that are open.
A monorail connects many of the leading hotels.
Many people view Las Vegas as a total entertainment package.
One word of caution, set yourself a limit on how much you will spend at the casinos.
Gambling can be addictive.

271,271. Shopping at the mall,B1,271-shopping-at-the-mall,38,"At one time in North America, most people shopped downtown on Main Street.
Most businesses were at the center of town.
When people started using automobiles, however, they moved away from downtown.
In time, most people lived in the suburbs.
Eventually, stores and small shopping plazas were built in suburban areas.
Still, most of the big stores were downtown.
But as more and more cars were on the roads, driving and parking downtown became a problem.
There wasn't room for a lot of cars to park downtown.
People also didn't want to fight downtown traffic just to go shopping.
So in the 1950s and 1960s,
there was the beginning of large suburban shopping malls and plazas.
Plazas were a row of stores attached to one another.
Malls were usually a double row of stores with a roof connecting both rows.
This means that shoppers did all their shopping inside.
Large department stores and grocery stores were usually part of the mall, but there were many smaller stores as well.
When you came to the mall and went inside, many people would get a shopping cart.
You can walk along the aisles, putting your purchases in the cart.
When you're finished shopping, you can push your shopping buggy out to the car.
Many malls also have buggies or strollers for pushing small children along.
There can be a lot of walking in a trip to the mall.
In fact, some people go to the mall just to exercise.
A half dozen laps around the mall every morning amount to a pretty good workout.
However, there are always places to sit down when you get tired.
Most malls have a food court.
This is an open area with a lot of tables and chairs.
Usually there are a dozen or more small restaurants circled around the food court.
The department stores often have full-size restaurants.
Malls have large parking lots. Unlike downtown, you don't pay to park at the mall.
On a busy day, finding a space close to the store can be a challenge.
Many people go to the malls when the weather is bad.
During wintry weather, the malls are busy.
Likewise, in really hot summer weather, people go to the malls to get cool.
The climate there is always the same.
People don't go to malls just to shop. They also go to meet people.
Usually, you bump into friends and neighbors there.
Old people, as well as teenagers, go there to see friends.
Usually the malls sponsor special events.
With lots to see and do, malls are a popular place to ""hang out"".

272,272. Stephen Foster - American songwriter,B2,272-stephen-foster---american-songwriter,54,"Before radio and television, movies and recordings, entertainment was often a family or community matter.
Someone in the family could play a musical instrument, or a neighborhood musician would play for small gatherings.
In addition, there would be travelling groups of musicians, actors and clowns who would go from town to town.
In nineteenth century United States, one of the most popular forms of entertainment was the minstrel show.
Black slavery was still permitted in the southern states until 1865.
Even after that date, the lives of many blacks working on large farms or plantations did not change much.
They did hard physical labor in the fields, had little control over their lives, and very little time to relax with their friends.
Foster, who was born in 1826, made this situation the background for many of his songs.
White musicians would try to imagine the feelings of black men and women working on the plantations.
They would write songs in the dialect or speech patterns that they thought black slaves used.
In these songs, the black people would be talking about their hardships, falling in love, playing music and dancing,
and finally growing old and dying.
White performers would blacken their faces and sing these songs to white audiences.
They would play musical instruments, like the banjo - a small four-stringed guitar, which black people played often.
As a small boy, Stephen Foster had sometimes been taken to a black church by his family's black servant, Olivia Pise.
Here he first heard the melodies that inspired his own songs.
Only a couple of Foster's songs are based directly on ""Negro spirituals"",
but many of his songs have the natural simplicity and emotional power of folk songs.
The youngest member of a large family, Foster showed his musical talent at an early age.
He played the flute, violin, and piano.
Growing up in an energetic business family, Stephen was expected to become a businessman.
And, for a while, he worked as a bookkeeper.
All his spare time, however, was spent writing songs.
Foster attended minstrel shows and tried to get the performers to sing his songs.
Sometimes the performers would steal his songs and publish them under their own names.
Copyright laws were weak and rarely enforced,
so some music publishers would just go ahead and publish a song without paying the songwriter.
Since Foster hoped to make a living as a songwriter, this was a problem.
Foster's first hit song was ""Oh! Susanna"" published in 1848.
It became popular with the thousands of men from all over the United States
who were heading west to the Californian gold-rush of 1849.
Unfortunately, as an unknown songwriter, Foster received no money from his early songs.
He seemed to have given them outright to the music publishers, just to establish his reputation.
Foster's name, however, was soon widely known,
and in 1849 he was able to afford to give up bookkeeping,
and marry the daughter of a Pittsburgh physician.
During the next five years, he earned a moderately good income from songwriting.
In 1851, a daughter Marion was born.
Foster wrote many of his best-known songs at this time: ""Old Folks at Home"" in 1851;
""My Old Kentucky Home"" in 1853,
and ""Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair"" in 1854.
Difficulties in Foster's marriage began fairly soon.
These may have been partly due to his strange work habits.
He spent days locked in his room working on his songs.
Then he would rush out with his materials to the local music store,
presumably to test out the songs on his friends.
He also became more and more addicted to alcohol.
Eventually, his wife and daughter left him.
Foster died alone in a rooming house in 1864.
Immigrants to the United States brought their traditional folk songs with them.
However, there were very few typically American songs.
Foster provided many songs that expressed the life of nineteenth century U.S.A.
His songs were easy to sing, and were popular with nearly everyone.
In a sense, Foster helped to create roots for American popular music.

273,273. Sunday morning at church,B2,273-sunday-morning-at-church,46,"Every Sunday is a holiday, or half-holiday, in North America.
Some stores may be open, but banks, offices, and government services are usually closed.
Sunday closing has a Christian origin.
Christians believe that Jesus Christ rose from the dead on a Sunday morning.
So Sunday is known as the ""Lord's Day"".
About 30% or 35% of North Americans attend church regularly on Sunday mornings.
About the same percentage attend church occasionally.
At Christmas and Easter the churches are very full, as people celebrate these two important holy days.
Nearly everybody goes to church at least three times.
They are baptized or dedicated as a child.
Most people are married in a church, and many people are buried after a church service.
Church services are usually held on Sunday mornings, often at 11 o'clock am,
although there may also be evening services provided.
Most services last an hour.
Their purpose is to worship God and to help people focus on religious and moral beliefs.
The service is led by a pastor, minister or priest
who usually also looks after the people and the business of the church.
It is the pastor who delivers the sermon - a twenty-minute talk on a religious or moral matter.
Usually members take part in the service.
They may lead the singing, read from the Bible,
offer prayers for the congregation, take up the collection, or act as ushers.
Most churches also have a choir, a group of singers who lead in singing the hymns.
There are many cultural traditions connected to going to church.
People normally wear their best clothing, and try to be on their best behavior.
Talking or making noise in church is usually considered bad.
This is why children often have a separate ""children's church"" or Sunday school, where they can be more like children.
The Sunday service is the main weekly event at many churches.
But nowadays there are a growing number of large ""super-churches"" which organize all kinds of activities for their members.
These churches usually have large buildings and a large staff to plan and lead various activities.
These might include prayer group, counseling and social work,
youth programs, social action, fund-raising events, etc.
Many large churches have gymnasiums for regular sports activities.
At the same time, ""house churches"" are also becoming very popular.
These are small groups of people who meet at private homes.
Sometimes a group will meet in a house until they have the money to buy a church.
But many people say they prefer to meet in small groups.
That way, they get to know one another better.
Then they feel comfortable sharing their problems and successes, and praying for each other.
Some say that large churches can interfere with getting close to God and other Christians.
There are many different ""brands"" of Christianity.
The largest single denomination in North America is Roman Catholicism.
One large Christian ""brands"" are Episcopalian, Methodist, Baptist,
Pentecostal, Lutheran and Presbyterian.
All have slightly different traditions and beliefs.
Although in the past, these groups have often been in conflict with one another,
today they usually cooperate in working together for their members and the community.

274,274. Thanksgiving day,B2,274-thanksgiving-day,52,"Thanksgiving Day has a special meaning for Americans.
Many holidays were brought along from Europe by the early settlers, and didn't change very much.
But Thanksgiving takes on a special shape in North America.
That is because of the Thanksgiving celebrated by the early pilgrim settlers in Massachusetts in 1621.
These early settlers were from England and they were known as Puritans.
This is because they wanted to purify the state religion of England.
They felt that the churches were more concerned with politics and customs than God and worship.
They were also called Pilgrims, because they were willing to travel to other countries
in order to worship God the way they wanted to.
When the English government put some of the Pilgrims in jail, the rest left England and went to the Netherlands.
In the Netherlands, they could have their own churches.
However, it was hard to earn a living there, and at first they didn't know the language.
In time, the English king learned where they were and tried to have them arrested.
So they thought of another plan.
Pilgrim leaders like William Brewster attempted to raise money to start a colony in North America.
They would have to borrow money and pay it back later.
Thirty members of the Pilgrim church in the Netherlands voted to sail to America with their families.
They returned to England and set sail on two ships, the Speedwell and the Mayflower.
When the Speedwell appeared unable to cross the ocean, both ships returned to England.
All who still wanted to sail crowded into the Mayflower and set sail on September 6, 1620.
Many of the passengers became sick during the long voyage, and some died.
They encountered fierce storms because they were sailing late in the season.
After 66 days, they sighted the sandy shoreline of Cape Cod, in present-day Massachusetts.
There was disagreement between the Pilgrims and others on board ship about what to do.
So first they had to agree to a common form of government and elect a governor.
Since winter was coming, they decided to stay on the ship till spring.
About half of the remaining settlers died during the first winter.
When the Mayflower sailed back to England, only about fifty settlers were left.
Nearly half of these were children.
There were Indians in Massachusetts, but at first they were not friendly.
They shot arrows at the settlers.
But one day a friendly Indian named Samoset came to visit them.
He spoke English and could tell them many things.
He brought another Indian named Squanto, who showed the Pilgrims how to plant corn.
Eventually, their chief Massosoit came, and he promised to keep peaceful relations with the settlers.
All spring and summer of 1621, the Pilgrims worked hard in the fields.
They also finished building houses and barns.
In the fall, they were delighted to see that the corn and vegetables had grown well.
They decided to have a thanksgiving feast and invited their Indian friends.
On the day of the feast, Chief Massosoit came with ninety Indians.
There were turkeys, deer meat and fish to eat.
The feast lasted three days.
When the food ran low, the Indians went out to shoot more birds and animals.
The Pilgrims and Indians competed in races, wrestling, shooting and other games.
The Pilgrims addressed prayers and thanks to God for providing food, shelter, freedom of religion and friendly Indians in this new land.
Ever since 1621, Thanksgiving celebrations include memories of that special occasion.
Today, turkeys, cranberries, corn and squash are usually part of the Thanksgiving meal.
In the United States, Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday.
It's celebrated every year on the fourth Thursday in November.
In Canada, where the harvest is earlier, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October.
The celebration always includes giving thanks for the good things that people have received, especially for food and families.
Along with this goes the Thanksgiving meal, when so many good things are eaten.

275,275. The Calgary Stampede,B2,275-the-calgary-stampede,43,"The ""Wild West"", as we know it from Hollywood westerns, did not last a long time.
Its height was from about 1865 to 1885, or only twenty years.
By 1885, there were railways across the plains,
fences had been built around farms and ranches and lawmen were on the lookout for any troublemakers.
Not only that, but by 1885 nearly all the buffalo had been killed, and most of the Indians were on reservations.
Still the ""Wild West"" had captured the imagination of the reading public.
A former buffalo hunter and Indian scout, Buffalo Bill Cody, decided to take advantage of his fame as a cowboy.
In 1883, he organized ""Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show"", and toured North America and Europe.
Alberta, Canada had been the last part of the old west to be settled.
But by 1912, ranching was being replaced by farming.
The city of Calgary was itself becoming a commercial and industrial center.
Old-timers looked back fondly to the old days of cowboys and Indians.
In 1908, the Miller Brothers' Wild West Show visited Calgary.
One of the cowboys, Guy Weadick, talked to local businessmen about putting on a rodeo and the Wild West Show.
Eventually, four Calgary businessmen put up $25,000 each to finance the event.
Weadick was a good organizer.
He advertised all over the U.S. and the Canadian west for cowboys and rodeo-riders to come.
And with $25,000 in prize money, people came from as far away as Mexico.
Weadick was able to persuade the Canadian government to let large numbers of Indians leave their reservations to attend.
In fact, the Indians were a big part of the program.
The main rodeo events were bronco riding, bareback riding,
women's bronco riding, steer roping and bulldogging.
These events were based on things that working cowboys actually did.
But to make them harder, special bucking horses were brought in.
One horse named Cyclone had never been ridden long by anyone.
He had thrown 127 riders in a row.
Most of the rodeo cowboys came from the United States, from Wyoming, Oregon,
Oklahoma, Colorado and Arizona.
But there were also Canadian cowboys and some Canadian Indians competing.
Queen Victoria's son, the Duke of Connaught, was the grand marshal.
Many cowboys rode well, but no one could stay on Cyclone.
On the sixth and final day, the grounds were muddy from rain, and the horses kept slipping.
Cyclone escaped from his handlers and ran around the track.
For this last bronco-riding contest, Cyclone's rider would be Tom Three Persons.
Three Persons was a Blood Indian from Southern Alberta.
When Three Persons got on Cyclone, the horse would rear up, then plunge its head down to throw the rider.
Cyclone acted as though it would topple over backwards, but Three Persons hung on.
Then it hurled itself forward with its head almost touching the ground.
After a wild ride of several minutes, Cyclone began to tire.
The judges declared Tom Three Persons the winner of the bucking bronco event.
Three Persons was the only Canadian to win a major event at that first Calgary Stampede in 1912.
Today, the Calgary Stampede continues to be the largest rodeo and Wild West show in North America.
It has many new events and attractions and still attracts the best rodeo riders from all over North America.

276,276. The Florida Everglades,B2,276-the-florida-everglades,54,"Southern Florida stretches south, dividing the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico.
Stretching further south is the Florida Keys.
These coral islands are the southernmost part of the United States.
Since much of southern Florida is close to sea level, it's very swampy.
The famous Everglades are wetlands where tall grass and bunches of trees grow.
Part of these swamps has been drained for agricultural land.
The soil is rich and market gardening is an important activity.
The Everglades that remain are too wet to be used for farming.
The Everglades are a ""river of grass"".
The deeper water areas stay wet all year, but the shallower pools dry up in the dry season.
Some of the water has been drained off for agricultural purposes, making the Everglades drier.
Nonetheless, the best way to travel in this region is by airboats.
These high boats can go through water and sail over clumps of grass.
Besides the wet grasslands, southern Florida has smaller areas of tropical forest.
These areas of hardwood trees are called hammocks,
and they are rich in animal and plant life.
Along much of the coast are mangrove trees,
which provide important nesting grounds for wild birds.
The Florida Keys stretch 200 miles from Miami southwest.
These islands are tropical in climate.
Fishing and tourism are important industries.
Because of its sub-tropical nature,
the animal and plant life of southern Florida differs from other parts of the United States.
Characteristic animals are alligators and crocodiles.
Alligators prefer fresh water and usually live inland, while crocodiles live in salt water along the coast.
Both animals are considered dangerous.
Alligator wrestling is considered a sport for the brave or foolhardy.
Probably Florida is the most famous for its birds.
At one time, many species were almost extinct.
Their long feathers were used on women's hats.
Now the law protects them.
Florida has at least six species of herons, several egrets, wood storks, white ibises and cormorants.
Characteristic Florida birds are the purple gallinule, the anhinga,
the limpkin, flamingoes and roseate spoonbills.
Many of these birds are notable for their size, coloring and interesting habits.
Notable animals include the key deer, a miniature form of the white-tailed deer.
There are also panthers or cougars, bobcats, marsh rabbits,
mangrove squirrels, round-tailed muskrats and the manatee.
Naturally, the Everglades are home to many reptiles.
Snakes are common, both water snakes and land species.
There are four poisonous varieties.
Both land and sea turtles abound and lizards are fairly common.
Fishing is a major industry.
Sports fishermen go to sea in search of trophies, such as marlin, sailfish and tarpon.
Smaller fish are caught commercially.
Fresh water sport fish include bass and gar.
After many decades of work to protect the animals and plants of the Everglades,
the region finally became a National Park in 1947.
It is the third largest park in the U.S.A. and covers 1.5 million acres.
Within the park live 300 kinds of birds,
30 kinds of mammals,
65 kinds of reptiles and amphibians,
and nearly 1,000 species of flowering plants.
Of course, it is a major tourist attraction.

277,277. The Great Walls of China,B2,277-the-great-walls-of-china,42,"The Great Wall of China is famous in North America, and many tourists would like to travel there.
However, most North Americans don't know very much about Chinese history.
That is changing now, as China is becoming an important subject for study in the West.
The settled communities of China were targets for nomadic raids since earliest times.
For much of its early history, China was not fully unified.
However, Shih Huang, who died in 210 B.C., united the whole country.
Then he set about defending China from the northern nomads.
It seems likely there had been defensive walls in the north before.
However, Shih Huang had a wall constructed across the entire north of China.
This defensive wall extended for almost 2,000 miles and had 25,000 towers.
Such walls were very expensive to build.
They also required huge numbers of men to construct them, and later to defend them.
Even so, the Great Wall did not stop nomadic invasions altogether.
Not long after Shih Huang's death, a tribe called the Huns crossed the wall.
The Emperor Hu Ti, who expanded Chinese power beyond the Wall, defeated them.
Centuries later, the Mongols to the north of China were united under Genghis Khan.
The Mongols attacked China, and Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis,
became the first non-Chinese emperor of China in 1279.
Eventually, the Chinese rebelled and overthrew their Mongol rulers.
Nonetheless, the Mongols remained a threat.
In 1449, they destroyed a Chinese army and captured the Emperor.
A new Great Wall was begun to keep the Mongols out.
This is the wall which tourists visit today and which is pictured on Chinese stamps.
Construction continued for 200 years.
While some parts were built of packed earth, much of the wall was built of stone, brick and rubble.
This is why it took so long.
Stones had to be quarried, and bricks baked and carried to the site.
Laborers, peasants, soldiers and criminals were forced to work on the wall.
Large and small forts and watchtowers carefully guarded the wall.
Nearly a million soldiers were stationed along it.
The Chinese defenders lit fires when the enemy was sighted.
Plumes of smoke and cannon shots told that the enemy was advancing and how many there were.
By 1644, the new wall was almost completed.
That same year, however, an internal uprising overthrew the Emperor.
This revolt was partly caused by the high taxes demanded to pay for the wall.
The Emperor's men invited the nomadic Manchu tribe to come through the gates in the wall to help put down the revolt.
The Manchus came; but they stayed, and ruled China for several hundred years.
Since the Manchus ruled both north and south of the wall, they did not care about maintaining it.
Many parts fell into disrepair, and some completely disappeared.
Today the parts that remain are a major tourist attraction.
The Great Wall of China is one of the wonders of the world.
Even if it really didn't succeed in its purpose of keeping the northern nomads out of China.

278,278. The Internet,C1,278-the-internet,49,"The first working computers in the 1950s and 1960s were large mainframe machines.
In some ways, they were like large calculating machines.
The U.S. government, the military and businesses and institutions used them for specific tasks.
For example, they might be used to handle the payroll.
As more uses were found for computers,
the need to transfer data from one computer to another became a concern.
In 1969, the U.S. government sponsored a program
to explore ways for computers to transfer data over telephone lines.
The first Internet was created with four computers linked together.
Of course, computer use increased beyond anyone's expectations.
Standards were developed that describe how data was to be transferred between computers.
A common language for commands and communications emerged.
Operating programs such as MS-DOS, UNIX, Macintosh and Windows came into existence.
The Internet quickly expanded beyond government and military uses.
The PC became the standard form of computer.
Private agencies acted as hosts for Internet usage.
Around 1982, there were 213 hosts;
by 1986, there were 2,300.
Today, there are millions.
The role of computers expanded so quickly that the U.S.S.R.,
which had discouraged computer use,
found itself left behind by the U.S.A.
Part of the reason for the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989
was that they had fallen too far behind the United States
in high tech areas to ever catch up.
One of the most popular uses of the computer is electronic mail, or e-mail.
You can send a letter by computer over the Internet to anywhere in the world in seconds or less.
And it doesn't cost anything extra.
Now data can be transferred great distances almost instantaneously.
Another major Internet use is the World Wide Web.
In the early days, all web pages were text only.
In the 1990s, it became possible to make web pages interactive and multi-media.
Interactive means that readers could click on items on the web page and get more information.
They could also communicate directly with the web-page owner.
Multi-media means that web pages were no longer text only.
They could also have graphics, film (video) and audio.
This has helped to turn computers into popular entertainment.
Nowadays, people spend hours every day surfing the net.
However, there are some problems. For some people, computers are addictive.
Many businesses are trying to control employees using the net during working hours.
Since the Internet includes just about every kind of information, not all of it is good.
You can find directions on how to become a criminal or a terrorist.
There are scam artists who want to cheat you out of money.
There are also aggressive, pornography salesmen,
not to mention people who want to kill your computer with viruses.
Since the Internet is not closely regulated, it's up to individual users to follow computer etiquette.
Parents need to supervise their children's use of the net.
Although the Internet has some disadvantages,
many people see the net as one of the greatest inventions of modern times.

279,279. The Planetarium,B2,279-the-planetarium,39,"All around the world stargazing is a popular activity.
The night sky lit up with stars is one of the most impressive scenes in nature.
Besides its natural beauty, people study the night sky for many reasons.
Some believe that they can read the future in the stars.
Others think that the stars influence the weather,
while some people worship the stars and the planets.
There is a problem with stargazing.
If the night is cloudy, people on the ground cannot see the stars,
also bad weather makes being outside at night uncomfortable.
Besides, not everybody wants to stay up late at night.
A planetarium is an ideal solution to all these problems.
A planetarium is usually a large dome-covered building.
It has seating like a theatre. The program here is a star show.
A special projector throws a picture of the night sky on the ceiling of the planetarium theatre.
Like a movie projector, the planetarium projector can show a constantly changing program.
It can show how the stars look right now,
how they looked thousands of years ago, and how they will look in the future.
Planetariums can be both entertaining and educational.
School children can go to learn about the nine planets of the solar system,
or about the various groupings of stars.
Planetariums can teach you how to find the stars and planets yourself when you're out at night.
There can also be dramatic showings about changes to the universe over time.
This is also a way to view special phenomena,
like Halley's Comet, which only appears once in a lifetime.
Planetariums can also show how ancient people viewed the skies.
Shepherds, living out under the sky, imagined that groups of stars represented wonderful people and huge animals.
Stories were told about these constellations.
Sometimes, the story explained how the people or animals became stars.
For example, why Orion, the mighty hunter, is chasing Taurus the Bull.
Planetariums can project these figures on their screen.
They can also speed up changes in the heavens.
It takes about 28 days for the moon to travel through all its phases.
Changes in the moon, or in the sun, can be shown easily.
Planetariums can also show the sky the way it appears in another part of the world.
Or the way it appeared on a famous historical occasion.
Special heavenly phenomena, such as a meteor shower, can also be demonstrated.
Things that appear only rarely in the real sky can be shown every night.
A planetarium is usually concerned to put in special programs to keep its audience coming back.
Since the heavens are always moving and changing, there is no shortage of ideas for programmers.

280,280. Alexander Graham Bell,B2,280-alexander-graham-bell,47,"The Victorian period was a time of many new inventions.
Earlier discoveries, such as the steam engine, the screw propeller,
the power of electricity, and the possibility of sending messages along a wire, were now applied to everyday life.
Inventors such as Thomas Edison and Nicholas Tesla explored new methods for harnessing electric power.
Some of the greatest discoveries were made by Alexander Graham Bell.
Bell was born in Scotland in 1847.
Both his father and grandmother taught speech methods and worked with deaf and dumb children.
Alexander was also interested in this work, especially as his mother was almost deaf.
Alexander's two brothers died of tuberculosis, and he himself contracted the disease,
so his parents decided to leave Scotland for a drier, healthier climate.
They moved to Brantford, Ontario, Canada, and lived in a roomy, comfortable house overlooking the Grand River.
Today, the Bell Homestead is an historical museum that attracts visitors from all over the world.
At that time, Canada did not have a lot of business opportunities,
so Alexander found a job teaching speech in Boston, U.S.A.
But he returned to Brantford every summer.
In Boston, Bell married one of his deaf students.
His father-in-law suggested that there were good business opportunities in inventing communication devices.
Bell soon developed a method for sending more than one telegraph message at the same time.
While working on improving the telegraph, Bell and his assistant, Thomas Watson,
found a way to send the human voice over wires.
On August 10, 1876,
Bell sent the first telephone message over wires strung between Brantford and Paris, Ontario - eight miles away.
The telephone caused an international sensation, with government leaders asking to have one.
But Bell didn't stop there.
He worked on the recording properties of wax cylinders and other approaches to flat phonograph records.
He also developed the photophone, which later led to the development of the motion picture sound track.
Bell worked on these inventions at his laboratory in Washington, D.C.,
but he didn't like the hot humid summer weather there.
So Bell began looking for a new place to spend his summers.
He decided to build a summer home in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.
The Island reminded Bell of his native Scotland.
Now he had space during the summer to do experiments outside.
He soon began to experiment with flying machines.
Bell designed and tested huge kites, hoping to come up with a frame for a flying machine.
Along with some enthusiastic friends, Bell also experimented with airplanes.
On February 23, 1909, one of these planes flew through the air for half a mile.
This was the first airplane flight in the British Empire.
Alexander Graham Bell Museum in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, displays many of these inventions.
Bell was also interested in making a faster boat.
Since much of a boat stays under water, the water resistance slows the boat down.
Bell thought that if you could raise the boat out of the water it would go much faster.
Working on Cape Breton Island, Bell and his friends developed the hydrofoil,
a boat that would skim the surface of the water at high speeds.
Hydrofoils are in use in many places today.
Every time people use the telephone, listen to a recording,
watch a movie or television, or ride on a hydrofoil,
they owe a debt to that great inventor, Alexander Graham Bell.

281,281. The story of Anne Frank,B2,281-the-story-of-anne-frank,53,"War, persecution, and economic depression affect not only adults, but also old people, children, babies, the sick and the handicapped.
Since history is written mostly about politicians, soldiers, intellectuals and criminals,
we don't read very often about how events affect ordinary people.
Now and then a special book will shed light on what it was like to live in the midst of terrible events.
Such a book is ""The Diary of Anne Frank"".
Anne Frank was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in 1929.
Her father Otto Frank was a businessman who moved the family to the Netherlands in 1934.
In Amsterdam, Otto started a company selling pectin to make jams and jellies.
Later he began a second company that sold herbs for seasoning meat.
Otto Frank had decided to leave Germany because of the policies and personality of the new German Chancellor Adolph Hitler.
Hitler had a personal hatred not only for Jewish people but also for everything Jewish.
He felt that one way to strengthen Germany and solve its problems was to kill or drive out all the Jews.
Hitler also felt that other groups, such as blacks, gypsies, the handicapped, homosexuals
and the chronically unemployed should be eliminated.
Then only strong healthy ""true Germans"" would be left.
Since Hitler had a plan to solve Germany's economic problems, he received a lot of popular support.
Very few Germans realized that he was mentally and emotionally unbalanced
and would kill anyone who got in his way.
The Frank family was Jewish, and they felt that they would be safe in the Netherlands.
However, in May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands and soon took over the government.
In 1941, laws were passed to keep Jews separate from other Dutch citizens.
The following year, Dutch Jews began to be shipped to concentration camps in Germany and Poland.
Just before this began, Anne Frank, Otto's younger daughter, received a diary for her 13th birthday.
Less than a month later, the whole family went into hiding.
Otto Frank had made friends with the Dutch people who worked with him in his business operations.
Now these friends were ready to help him,
even though hiding Jews from the authorities was treated as a serious crime.
Behind Otto Frank's business offices, there was another house that was not visible from the street.
Here the Franks moved many of their things.
Only a few trusted people knew they were living there.
The Franks moved into these small rooms on July 6, 1942,
and they lived there with another Jewish family, the Van Pels,
until the police captured them on August 4, 1944.
So, for more than two years, the two families never went outside.
All their food and supplies had to be brought to them.
During this period, Anne Frank told her diary all of her thoughts and fears.
Like any teenage girl, she hoped that good things would happen to her,
that she would become a writer or a movie star.
She complained that her parents treated her like a child.
She insisted that she was grown up.
She also talked about how difficult it was to live in a small area with seven other people and not to be able to go outside.
She wrote about the war and hoped the Netherlands would soon be liberated from the Germans.
Anne sometimes envied her older sister, Margot, who was so much more mature, and who never got into trouble.
She and Margot wrote letters to each other to pass the time.
Anne even had a romance with Peter van Pels, who was seventeen.
Then all their fears came true.
All the eight Jews hiding in the house were arrested and eventually sent to Auschwitz death camp in Poland.
Although the war was ending, it did not end soon enough for the Frank family.
Only Otto Frank survived the war.
One of their helpers, Miep Gies, saved Anne's diary and kept it.
After the war, Otto Frank decided to publish it.
Since 1947 more than 20 million copies have been sold in 55 languages.
Anne's diary shows the terrible cost of hatred, persecution and war better than any history book.

282,282. Charlotte Church,B1,282-charlotte-church,59,"Many years ago, a German opera impresario was asked why so many of his leading ladies were physically unattractive.
He replied, ""The ones who look like horses, sing like nightingales, and vice versa"".
Certainly, a good voice doesn't always go with an attractive appearance.
But in our day of media images, good looks seem very important.
Charlotte Church recorded her first album when she was 12 years old.
It was called, ""Voice of an Angel"".
Everyone agreed that the little girl has a very big voice.
And they were delighted that Charlotte not only sounded like an angel, she also looked like one.
Her sweet schoolgirl appearance and winning smile are part of her success.
Charlotte Church was born in Cardiff, Wales in February, 1986.
Music and singing are very important in Welsh culture,
and all of Charlotte's family were musical.
Although Wales is part of Great Britain,
the Welsh people are very proud of their own language, history and heritage.
Now that Wales has its own parliament in Cardiff,
Welsh culture is promoted even more strongly.
Charlotte sings some of her songs in the Welsh language.
Charlotte began singing along with the radio as an infant, and by the age of three she could sing a number of popular songs.
She began singing lessons when she was nine.
Charlotte first appeared on television early in 1997.
This led to a number of other TV and concert appearances.
In 1998, she signed a contract with Sony to record five albums.
Since Charlotte's first album appeared, she has spent a lot of time doing promotional tours.
Since she's a schoolgirl, her two tutors travel along with her.
""Voice of an Angel"" was recorded in five days in Cardiff, Wales.
All the songs were ones that Charlotte already knew and liked.
These included ""Pie Jesus"", ""The Lord's Prayer"", ""Jerusalem"", and ""Danny Boy"".
The album came out on November 9, 1998,
and within a couple of weeks was number four on the popular music charts.
She recorded her second album, ""Charlotte Church"", in 1999.
Travelling involves doing ""showcases"" for people in the music industry and the media.
This is to encourage people to promote your music.
Charlotte also appeared on various U.S. talk shows, including David Letterman and Jay Leno.
She finds that she gets asked the same questions over and over again.
Besides media celebrities, Charlotte has met many leading public figures.
Since she is a Roman Catholic, Charlotte was especially excited to meet the Pope.
This was after she'd been invited to sing at a Christmas concert at the Vatican.
She was also asked to sing at Prince Charles' fiftieth birthday party in 1998.
She saw the Prince again in 1999, when she sang at the official opening
of the Welsh National Assembly.
Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip talked to her too.
Later that year, she sang for Bill and Hilary Clinton at the Ford Theatre in Washington.
Something that people like about Charlotte Church is that she hasn't been spoiled by fame.
Many show business kids are loud, brash, noisy and rude.
But when she is away from the stage, the young singer leads a normal life with her family and friends.
Even when she is on TV, she comes across as an ordinary teenager, but a very nice one.
Charlotte's voice always gets comments.
It seems like such a big voice for a little girl.
Very few teenagers have a powerful operatic voice like hers.
Some people have found it hard to believe that it is actually Charlotte singing.
For the most part, she enjoys her success.
She likes to travel and meet new people.
Los Angeles is her favorite city, and she likes the United States and Canada.
But she is always glad to get home to Wales and be with her friends.
At the moment, she goes to an all-girl school, so she doesn't see boys very often.
But, at age fifteen, an interest in boys is likely to become a factor in her life.
Charlotte now has recorded three albums, and we can expect a fourth in 2001.
She also has written an account of her life for all her fans.
It is entitled, ""Voice of an Angel: My Life (So Far)"".

283,283. Christmas holidays,B2,283-christmas-holidays,55,"In many ways, Christmas is the most important holiday in North America.
It is the most important commercial festival.
Most retail stores do half their annual business in the six weeks or so before Christmas.
Christmas is an important holiday from work and school.
Many workers take the whole week off between Christmas and New Year's Day.
It is the biggest time of the year for parties, gift-giving, home decorations and visiting.
Many homeowners compete to see who can have the best display of lights.
It is also an important time for the entertainment industry.
Many Christmas movies, TV shows, recordings, concerts and plays are produced every year for the Christmas season.
It is also the time of year when the largest number of people attend church,
because Christmas is a religious festival too.
It celebrates the birth of Jesus.
How all these different things came together to become Christmas is a long story.
Why, for example, is Jesus' birthday celebrated on December 25th?
No one knows the exact day that Jesus was born.
But, Jesus was born during the Roman Empire,
and for the Romans, December 25th was a very important day.
The Romans had many gods and many religions.
Two religions, both of which had one main god, were the worship of the Invincible Sun and Mithras.
These gods were both honored on December 25th.
Because December 25th was just after the shortest day of the year,
it was a natural time to worship the sun.
December was also a time to celebrate the end of the agriculture year.
The Romans held one of their main festivals, the Saturnalia, beginning on December 17th.
That lasted for a week.
The Romans also began the custom of celebrating New Year's Day on January 1.
So the last half of December and the beginning of January was a wonderful time for partying and games.
The early Christians didn't know what day Jesus was born.
At first, they celebrated his birthday on January 6th.
However, as most people in the Roman Empire were becoming Christians,
it was decided to move the date to December 25th.
The celebration lasted twelve days until January 6th, and took the place of all other festivals.
That way, people who were used to celebrating on December 25th would feel more comfortable.
As different peoples became Christian, they brought their own customs to be part of Christmas.
The people of northern Europe used evergreen trees and mistletoe as symbols of spring and eternal life.
The evergreen tree became the Christmas tree.
The mistletoe is hung from the ceiling at Christmas for couples to kiss under.
It was also in northern Europe where the idea of Santa Claus, or Father Christmas, began.
In Roman times, there was a man who became known as Saint Nicholas.
He is said to have given gifts to the poor and provided dowries for poor girls who wouldn't otherwise be able to marry.
The idea of the gift-giving Saint became joined with the northern idea of Spirit of Christmas festivities.
It was a poem written in 1831 by the American writer, Clement Moore,
which popularized Santa Claus throughout the world: ""Twas the night before Christmas..."".
told the story of how Santa visits every house in the world on Christmas Eve and brings toys for good girls and boys.
Since that time, parents have secretly bought toys for their children at Christmas.
When the children awake on Christmas Day, they find toys by the chimney, or under the Christmas tree.
They are told that Santa Claus and his reindeer brought them.
Adults also give gifts to each other at Christmas time.
No wonder that the stores sell so many things then!
It is often said that Christmas is becoming too commercialized.
In the rush to get everything ready: to buy the gifts, decorate the house and tree,
give parties, visit family and friends, and attend special Christmas events.
The original reason for celebrating is sometimes forgotten.
Only when people go to church, or sing Christmas carols, or attend musical performances about Jesus' birth,
do they remember that Christmas is the birthday of Christ.

284,284. Garage sales and yard sales,B2,284-garage-sales-and-yard-sales,43,"Every Saturday morning in our part of the world, except in winter,
many people drive around the city looking for yard sales.
Yard sales, or garage sales, often take place in the driveway of someone's home, or perhaps the front lawn.
The homeowners take out all the stuff they don't want and arrange it in front of their house.
Usually, they put a price tag on items.
People driving by will stop to see if there's anything they want.
Many people spend every Saturday morning shopping at yard sales.
If they find that they have bought too many things, then they have a yard sale of their own.
Some of the shoppers are dealers who buy things for resale.
Sometimes they resell them at their own yard sales.
But some dealers are professionals who run antique stores, used bookshops,
flea markets or used furniture and appliance stores.
Usually the dealers will try to get to the yard sale before anyone else.
That way they have the best selection.
Often they'll try to buy items for less than what the price tag says.
The cheaper they can buy the item, the more profit they can make when they resell it.
Their motto is, ""Buy low. Sell high"".
Sometimes a merchant will boast that he paid $1 for a glass or china cup at a yard sale, and sold it for $100 at his store, or on the Internet.
By having catalogs that show the value of ""collectibles"", dealers can sometimes make large profits.
Now, however, many of the people having yard sales will try to check the value of the things they are selling first.
So it is getting harder to get a real bargain.
One reason for yard sales is that North Americans often live in big houses, which fill up with things.
People may use the basement, the attic, the spare room and the garage to store things that they aren't using.
If they store things in their garage, all they have to do is open the garage door and have a garage sale.
When children grow up and move away, the parents will often sell the children's old clothes, toys and furniture.
Another reason for yard sales is that there are a lot of things that people might like, but don't want to pay full price for.
For example, if someone likes to read novels, they may be happy to pay $1 for a book at a yard sale,
rather than $20 or $30 at a retail store.
What sorts of things are sold at yard sales?
Just about anything you might find in a house or yard.
There are ornaments, china, home decorations, sports equipment, bicycles, games, dolls, toys, tables and chairs,
lamps, appliances, books, records, paintings, clothes, record players, and much much more.
Some items are things that were popular a few years ago but now have gone out of fashion.
This might include many toys, books and games that relate to an old television show that is no longer being shown.
While a lot of older people go to yard sales, so do a lot of students.
Students and young people may need cheap furniture for their apartment or a bicycle to get to school or work.
They may not be able to pay full price.
If you are lucky, you can find almost anything at a yard sale.
The trick is to get there early.
Most yard sales are advertised to start at 9 am,
but dealers may arrive as early as 7:30 am.
By 10 am the busiest part is already over, although most yard sales go on into the afternoon.
Yard sales tend to prove the common saying that ""one person's trash is another person's treasure"".

285,285. Helen Keller,B2,285-helen-keller,62,"What would it be like to be unable to see anything, hear anything, or say anything?
Life for young Helen Keller was like that.
She had an illness before she was two years old that had left her deaf, dumb and blind.
After that, it was difficult for her to communicate with anyone.
She could only learn by feeling with her hands.
This was very frustrating for Helen, her mother and her father.
Helen Keller grew up in Alabama, U.S.A., during 1880s and 1890s.
At that time, people who had lost the use of their eyes, ears and mouth
often ended up in charitable institutions.
Such a place would provide them with basic food and shelter until they died.
Or they could go out on the street with a beggar's bowl and ask strangers for money.
Since Helen's parents were not poor, she did not have to do either of these things.
But her parents knew they would have to do something to help her.
One day, when she was six years old,
Helen became frustrated that her mother was spending so much time with the new baby.
Unable to express her anger, Helen tipped over the baby's crib, nearly injuring the baby.
Her parents were horrified and decided to take the last chance open to them.
They would try to find someone to teach Helen to communicate.
A new school in Boston claimed to be able to teach children like Helen.
The Kellers wrote a letter to the school in Boston asking for help.
In March 1887 a teacher, twenty year old Anne Sullivan
arrived at the Keller's home in Tuscumbia, Alabama.
Anne Sullivan herself had a very difficult life.
Her mother had died when she was eight.
Two years later, their father had abandoned Anne and her little brother Jimmy.
Anne was nearly blind and her brother had a diseased hip.
No one wanted the two handicapped children, so they were sent to a charitable institution.
Jimmy died there.
At age 14, Anne, who was not quite blind, was sent to a school for the blind in Boston.
Since she had not had any schooling before, she had to start in Grade One.
Then she had an operation that gave back some of her eyesight.
Since Anne knew what it was like to be blind, she was a sympathetic teacher.
Before Anne could teach Helen anything, she had to get her attention.
Because Helen was so hard to communicate with,
she was often left alone to do as she pleased.
A few days after she arrived,
Anne insisted that Helen learn to sit down at the table and eat breakfast properly.
Anne told the Kellers to leave, and she spent all morning in the breakfast room with Helen.
Finally, after a difficult struggle she got the little girl to sit at the table and use a knife and fork.
Since the Keller family did not like to be strict with Helen,
Anne decided that she needed to be alone with her for a while.
There was a little cottage away from the big house.
The teacher and pupil moved there for some weeks.
It was here that Anne taught Helen the manual alphabet.
This was a system of sign language.
But since Helen couldn't see, Anne had to make the signs in her hands so she could feel them.
For a long time, Helen had no idea what the words she was learning meant.
She learned words like ""box"" and ""cat"", but hadn't learned that they referred to those objects.
One day, Anne dragged Helen to a water pump and made the signs for ""water""
while she pumped water over Helen's hands.
Helen at last made the connection between the signs and the thing.
""Water"" was that cool, wet liquid stuff.
Once Helen realized that the manual alphabet could be used to name things,
she ran around naming everything.
Before too long, she began to make sentences using the manual alphabet.
She also learned to read and write using the ""Square Hand Alphabet""
which was made up of raised square letters.
Before long, she was also using Braille and beginning to read books.
Helen eventually learned to speak a little, although this was hard for her because she couldn't hear herself.
She went on to school and then to Radcliffe College.
She wrote articles and books, gave lectures, and worked tirelessly to help the blind.
The little girl who couldn't communicate with anyone became, in time, a wonderful communicator.

286,11-Sep,C1,911,34,"September 11, 2001, or 9/11, is a day that many people will never forget.
It was a Tuesday morning when four planes were hijacked by terrorists,
leading to devastating attacks in the U.S.
Two planes hit the World Trade Center in New York City,
another hit the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.,
and the fourth, after a heroic effort by passengers, crashed in a field in Pennsylvania.
This tragic event claimed nearly 3,000 lives
and marked a huge shift in how the world sees security, terrorism, and international relations.
For many Americans, 9/11 is a day of shock, sadness, and reflection.
It's not just about the towers falling, but also about the stories of bravery.
Firefighters, police officers, and regular people stepped up in ways that were truly inspiring.
In the aftermath, the country came together, and there was a feeling of unity that cut across all backgrounds.
However, the ripple effects of 9/11 were huge.
It changed travel forever.
If you've flown recently, you're familiar with the long security lines, shoe removal, and strict liquid rules.
It also led to major political shifts.
The U.S. launched a global War on Terror, leading to military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In addition to that, there was the creation of the Department of Homeland Security,
which basically overhauled how America handles security.
But it's not all about laws and wars.
9/11 also brought up big questions about personal freedom, privacy,
and the role of government in keeping us safe.
The USA PATRIOT Act, for example, gave the government more power to track and monitor potential threats,
which raised eyebrows about how much is too much when it comes to surveillance.
On a cultural level, the event left its mark, too.
It shaped movies, books, and conversations about the world we live in.
Sadly, it also sparked a rise in fear and mistrust toward certain communities,
especially Muslims and people from the Middle East.
This led to incidents of discrimination and hate crimes,
which is a darker part of the post 9/11 story.
9/11 was a day that altered the course of history,
and while it brought about difficult times,
it also showed us how people can come together in the face of adversity.
It's a day to remember, reflect and hope for a better, more united future.

287,286. Trial by jury,C1,286-trial-by-jury,54,"If you are a citizen of Canada or the United States, it is very likely that you will be summoned at some time for jury duty.
A letter will come in the mail, telling you to report to a certain place at a given time.
There are legal penalties for not attending, because jury duty is considered every citizen's responsibility.
Often a large number of people, perhaps several hundred, will be summoned at one time.
When you arrive, you will join a line-up of others who are registering for duty.
Eventually, you will get to a table and talk to an official.
If you have a special reason for not being a juror, such as ill health, you may be excused at this point.
Those not immediately exempted will become a part of a ""jury panel"".
Out of this panel, a number of juries of twelve people will be chosen.
These will decide a variety of criminal cases over the next few weeks.
What follows is the experience of one woman in a ""jury pool"".
She went ahead with others into a large courtroom where they spent the whole day.
At the front of the courtroom were the judge, and the lawyers for the prosecution and for the defence.
One of the lawyers explained what the case was going to be about.
The names of the jury panel were in a box at the front.
When someone's name was called, they went up to the front of the courtroom.
The person called up would then have a chance to explain why they couldn't serve as a juror,
if there was some reason preventing them.
For example, one woman was dismissed because she knew the accused.
The first jury to be chosen was for a burglary case.
A panel member went forward and faced the accused.
Then the lawyers in the trial decided whether the juror was satisfactory to them.
At lunchtime, the panel was dismissed for an hour.
The second jury was to try someone on a charge of murder.
Usually the panel was told approximately how long the trial might be.
Since jurors are not usually paid, many would like to avoid being involved in a long trial.
The woman was called forward and had to look the man accused of murder in the eye.
This made her quite nervous.
Judging by her expression, the two lawyers would decide whether they wanted her on the jury or not.
The defence lawyer would try to choose someone who seemed sympathetic to the man accused.
The prosecutor would prefer someone who was not sympathetic.
The woman excused herself by saying she had a very young child to look after and no relatives to help.
She was allowed to go home at the end of the day.
Some people wonder whether it is fair for lawyers to dismiss jurors who may not be sympathetic in their cases.
For example, defence lawyers may try to choose young people if they think these will be less severe to their clients.
In the case above, the lawyer seemed to prefer women to men.
This means that a lot of people are dismissed from being jurors without a good reason.
One principle of the jury system, however, is to protect the rights of the accused particularly well.
One might say that the jury system is biased in favor of the defendant.
This is why defence lawyers have an opportunity to dismiss people who they think will not be favorable to their clients.
Furthermore, having twelve jurors gives the defence a good opportunity for a successful defence.
If the defence attorney can raise a reasonable doubt about the guilt of his client in even one juror,
then the accused has a chance of being released.
This happened in the O.J. Simpson murder trial.
There, even though there was strong evidence that Simpson committed the crime,
the defence was able to insinuate some doubts among the jurors.
Moreover, the defence lawyers may be able to appeal to the emotions of the jurors,
particularly if they can think of a way to gain sympathy for their client.
For this reason, defence lawyers are more likely to choose trial by jury over trial by judge alone.
A judge is less likely to be swayed by emotion than a jury.
And a defence attorney may also prefer a criminal trial to a civil suit.
In the latter case, the client does not have to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
but will be found liable if the preponderance of evidence is against him or her.
This is why O.J. Simpson was acquitted on criminal charges, but then found liable for damages in a civil suit.

288,287. Business ethics,C1,287-business-ethics,45,"What do business and ethics have to do with each other?
Business is about making profits.
Ethics is about right and wrong.
How are they connected?
Well, business ethics is the study of right and wrong as applied to business actions.
Some businessmen would say that there is no need for business ethics.
If we don't break the laws of the country, we have nothing to worry about.
However, we can do many bad things without breaking laws.
In some countries, it would be legal for a businessman to pollute the land, sea and air,
to confine his workers to barracks and to hire children to work in factories.
But, these things may not be right.
On the other hand, it may be illegal for a businessman to do some good things.
For example, his society may expect him to treat people unequally and discriminate against some ethnic or religious groups.
In order to know what is right or wrong, we need a moral rule.
This rule does not come from business itself, but from ethics.
So we need a statement of what we believe to be right.
The American Declaration of Independence in 1776 states an ethical principle:
""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal"".
The Declaration further tells us that all men have a right to ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"".
Principles such as these can be used in American politics and law to decide whether an action is right or wrong.
Many companies have their own ethical guidelines.
IBM, for example, outlines its corporate ethics under headings such as, ""Tips, Gifts and Entertainment"",
""Accurate Reporting"", ""Fair Competition"", and ""Not boasting"".
So each employee knows what to do or not to do in various situations.
Ethical choices are made on three levels.
Individuals, by companies and by societies, make them.
An individual might choose whether or not to accept a bribe.
A company might decide whether or not to bribe government officials.
A government or society might decide whether or not to outlaw bribery.
Similar principles of right and wrong might be used at all three levels.
For example, it might be decided that bribery is simply wrong in all situations.
On the other hand, it might be decided to view the situation case by case.
In other words, there is a strong ethical stand and a more tentative ethical stand.
The strong ethical stand applies when you have a basic moral principle and apply it to all situations.
For example, you might believe that it was always wrong to let workers handle hazardous substances without any protection.
The weaker stand would consider whether it is legal to do so.
If it is legal to let workers handle dangerous materials,
and this conforms to social expectations,
then the weak ethical stand would say, ""No problem"".
As long as the law is not broken, and no one strenuously objects, then everything is okay.
However, in ethics there is a principle called the ""moral minimum"".
This principle means that you should never harm another person knowingly.
The only exception would be to protect some other people, or yourself.
So business ethics would say that the businessman who exposes his workers to hazardous chemicals is wrong.
He is not practicing the moral minimum.

289,288. Colonial Williamsburg,C1,288-colonial-williamsburg,50,"Travelers in the desert or the jungle sometimes see the remains of old cities.
These cities were once large and prosperous, but something has changed.
Perhaps the climate got drier or wetter;
perhaps the trade routes, which had brought merchants to the city, now went elsewhere;
perhaps enemies destroyed them; or perhaps disease or famine drove the people away.
Other cities, which were once important, have become less so in time.
Jamestown, Virginia, the first English colony in America is now only an historic site.
It began as the capital of Virginia.
But when fire destroyed the government buildings in 1699,
the capital was moved to nearby Williamsburg.
Williamsburg was an important town for many years.
The British Governors lived there, and two of them worked on the plans for the town and its buildings.
The College of William and Mary was established there in the 1690s - the second oldest college in America.
As the capital, Williamsburg contained many public buildings,
including a courthouse, a jail, a powder magazine,
the governor's palace, and the government building.
Of course, there were many private houses as well.
From 1699 until 1780, Williamsburg was the capital of Virginia.
Many people came there for government and legal business.
It was also a social center with dances, fairs, horse races and auctions.
The Governor and his wife provided expensive dinners and entertainment for their guests.
Most of the important people in Virginia owned tobacco plantations.
In 1612, John Rolfe had first raised tobacco to sell to England.
Soon tobacco farming was Virginia's most important business.
Most planters were able to build large houses and buy slaves to do their work.
One plantation owner is said to have owned 300,000 acres of land
and 1,000 black slaves, as well as having large amounts of money.
The planters were the leaders of this colonial society,
and they resented British interference in their local government.
When England imposed taxes on the American colonists in 1765,
it was a Virginian, Patrick Henry, who spoke against them.
His words, ""Give me liberty, or give me death"" helped to inspire the American Revolution.
As complaints about British rule increased, it was Virginians who led the rebels.
George Washington became commander of the revolutionary army,
and Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence in 1776.
In 1780, the capital of Virginia was moved to Richmond.
Williamsburg was now simply a small college town of local importance.
Not much changed in Williamsburg for many years.
In the twentieth century, the Reverend Dr. Goodwin, who was the priest at the Williamsburg Church,
had the idea of restoring Williamsburg to the way it appeared in colonial days.
Goodwin approached John D. Rockefeller Jr. with his idea,
and Rockefeller agreed to finance this project.
Beginning in 1926, the old buildings of Williamsburg were restored to their original form.
First were the college buildings, then the Raleigh Tavern,
the government building, the governor's palace and so on.
Buildings that had been destroyed over time were reconstructed from plans and descriptions.
Soon the restored buildings were opened to the public.
Guides, dressed in eighteenth century costumes, show visitors through the buildings and gardens.
Visitors can also travel to nearby tobacco plantations.
Now tourists who pay admission to visit this wonderful historic town finance much of the work of restoration and conservation.

I wanted to reach out to ask a couple of questions regarding small business banking.
I know there are several forms I need to fill out,

So, for the most basic business account,
there is a mandatory deposit of at least $10,000.
The process is pretty straight forward.
An account manager will look over the forms you fill out today,
we will cross-check that you have the funds,
and then you will receive an approval or denial.
When everything is filled out correctly the first time,
we can usually come to a result within 48 hours.
Oh, that seems easy enough.
Does the basic account include access to the banking app?
I run a small business,
so I would like people to have the option to pay through a bank transfer.
Can you explain that process?
Sure, no problem.
It is possible to receive payments via a bank transfer to your business account,
and we also have card scanners that you can use if you have a physical store.
If your business is an e-commerce shop,
I recommend a gold-level account,
which is helpful for taxes and bookkeeping.

My name is Bill Brooks.
Today I'll help you to learn how to use our office software and work to your best ability.
For your first day, you will get in groups of three people.
In each group, you will have a training assistant who specializes in workflow and office software.
Have a look at the poster by the door to find your group and sign in for attendance.
This will take a few minutes since there are so many of you.
Also, if you haven't turned in a copy of your work ID,
please make a copy and turn it into the secretary as soon as possible.
The copier is located in room 211.

Let's not waste time.
I want to explain to you about picking classes for this semester at Welcome Spanish.
You all know, the campus is only open on Wednesdays and Fridays
and all of our classes are two hours long.
If you're a first time student,
we only allow you to take two classes per semester.
We don't want students to get overwhelmed and we feel this is a good starting point.
If you are a returning student,
you can take as many classes as you feel is right for you.
Please be aware that some classes need to be taken in order.
In example, you can't take Spanish 2, if you have not taken Spanish 1.
The same concept applies to Spanish 3; you must have completed Spanish 2.
Does anyone have any questions?

These changes will have lots of implications down the line.

No, the meetings have been moved to the second floor.

I know you are headed to Pittsburgh on Wednesday for the farming trade show.

To be honest, we are focusing on getting the sales team there,
to learn about the products they are selling.
I'm not sure it would benefit someone in accounting, like yourself.
Why do you want to go?
I am actually interested in moving departments.
I thought it would be a good opportunity to learn about the products

The reason for this is that you and your spouse have chosen not to file your taxes jointly this year,

Anyway, we can discuss this next time we meet.

I am from the Bill's Grocers head office,

I was wondering if you would like to participate in a short survey?
Sure! I am a fan of the new layout.
I especially love the larger aisles.
I previously would have trouble getting around other customers,

How about the updated stock and additional services we are offering?
I don't often use imported items,

I want to begin by going over the outcomes of the customer survey we conducted in April.
As you know, last year, we launched our new microwave, the Micro2000.
The features for this microwave were unparalleled,
as it has super defrost, low noise and eco-friendly.
Based on the feedback we got,
the feature consumers love most is that it can be set up within ten minutes.
Unfortunately, it also has a very high failure rate.
This is because people often miss a step of setting the microwave up,
so it malfunctions.
Next month, we will launch the Micro3000, and will make it even better!
Together, we can make our product even better, and fix our failures.

I wanted to talk about the work you recently completed for our blog.
It seems that the posts haven't been up to the standard we had hoped.
I agree.
Unfortunately, I am so busy and have had to hurry my posts lately,
so I haven't been able to spend much time looking up the background information I need for each article.
Do you think we have been assigning you too many posts?
I think that is it.
Since the recent redundancies, my workload has nearly tripled.
I am sorry, I know that must be hard.
My workload has grown as well.
Would it be helpful to give you a longer deadline for the posts?
I guess, but that is only a short-term solution.
It is going to be impossible to sustain the number of posts if we don't have a full staff.
Fine.
I will talk to all of the managers this afternoon
and we can start working towards a plan that is sustainable for all the staff.
Keeping our standards should be of utmost importance.

But, um, one of my neighbors had lessons at Heart Music Academy,

Another option is DrumeoProf online school.
They have online courses designed for all skill levels and topics at a fraction of the cost.
The second option is a lot more affordable.
Thanks for your advice.
I will look into both options.
By the way, I downloaded a list of equipment I might need.

Sure.
We cover basic office supplies, like pens and pencils,

All in all, we had a great four months.
We want to take these numbers into our next quarter.
Our next goal is to allow customers to place orders on our website.
This way, customers can make appointments and purchase items without coming into the store.
I think this is going to create higher sales and new customers.

We have never had the biggest value,

Well, we are already the second biggest firm in the country,

we would likely move up to overtake the first spot.

For reference, I am a 56 year old, non-smoking male.
We have several different plans available to a man your age.
We have three options for the lowest level of coverage, each with a different deductible.
The deductibles range from $500 to $1500.
So, what does that mean for my monthly cost?
The lower the deductible, the more expensive your monthly payments will be.
Do you have those numbers at hand?
Sure.
For a $500 deductible your total will be $350 a month.
For a $1500 deductible, you will pay $175 per month.
Payments for a $1000 deductible are somewhere in the middle of those two amounts.
Oh, I can afford those payments.

This is June Brown, your financial advisor, calling about your investment portfolio review.
I was looking over the account details you provided,
and I noticed that some information is missing.
Specifically, I don't have the latest updates on the income and valuations from your real estate investments.
These details are the missing pieces of the puzzle for a complete analysis of your financial situation.
Could you please email me the recent appraisals and income statements from your rental properties?
I won't be able to finalize the review of your investment portfolio without them...

This is Gina from the HR department.
I wanted to go over some details about your recent travel reimbursement request.
I understand you were attending the Tech Innovations Conference in Berlin last month.
Thank you for submitting the receipts for your flights, lodging, and meals.
However, there seems to be an issue with one of the hotel charges.
Our company policy covers only up to $150 per night,
and it looks like your hotel exceeded that.
Let's meet in person to clarify things.
Could you drop by my office tomorrow afternoon, around 3 pm?
That way, we can settle everything quickly.
Thanks.

it's vital that all arrangements fall into place seamlessly.
We can't afford to leave any stone unturned as we prepare.
Our event coordinator will now present an overview of the schedule,
followed by some brief insights into Ms. Mendel's compositions.
This should assist us in effectively planning the concerts and ensuring a successful series.

What's the price for that?
The tickets are $25 each.

Have your prices gone up lately?
My brother took the same tour a few weeks ago and mentioned it was $20 per person.
He probably purchased tickets during our Seasonal Promotion.
We occasionally offer special discounts at different times of the year,
which can lower the regular price.

and I just got word from our events coordinator that we are expecting more attendees than initially planned.
Consequently, we will need a different set up.
We won't need the additional small tents or portable speakers we originally ordered,
but we do need to increase the number of folding chairs.
We're looking at needing a total of 150 now.
Also, our finance team would like to handle these adjustments with a different company credit card,
so please call me back for the new payment details.
My contact information is on the original order form.
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
Thank you.

It's the Compact 270, booked under the name Rebecca Robinson.

No issues at all.
The car ran smoothly, and I had no problems.
But I couldn't get it washed before dropping it off,

That's alright.
Just so you know, there's a cleaning fee and a refueling charge.
I'll add those to your total.

For the most part, yes.
But we had fewer visitors than we planned for, which was a bit disappointing.
I felt the same.
I think we could have drawn a bigger crowd if we had done more advertising for the event.
I mentioned that to our manager, Mr. Lee, a few weeks back.
I thought he might approve additional marketing.
Do you know why he didn't?
I believe he couldn't set aside more funds for promotion
because our budget was already tied up in other commitments.
I guess we couldn't stretch it any further without robbing Peter to pay Paul.

I think all that repetitive lifting is what's causing the pain and swelling in my knee.

Got it.
I'll prescribe some anti-inflammatory meds to help with that.
You should also talk to your boss to see if there's a way to adjust your tasks,
maybe alternate with lighter duties, or build in some breaks.
That way, you can ease up on the strain and prevent aggravating it further.

This move comes after local business owners voiced their concerns.
Store owners from the Riverside District worry that the new bike lanes might make it hard for their customers to reach them
and could mess up delivery schedules.
Tom Harris, who heads urban planning for the city, spoke about it on Tuesday.
He promised that the city is taking these worries seriously,
and work on GreenWay will stop for now until a good solution is found.
Harris also said that people can check for updates and share their thoughts on the city's website,
so everyone stays informed and involved.

990,Cam19 - Test 1 - Part 1,B2,cam19---test-1---part-1,67,"Okay. What would you like to know?
Well, I'm new to this area,
so perhaps you could tell me something about the park first, please.
Of course.
Altogether the park covers 170 acres,
that's 69 hectares.
There are three main types of habitat:
wetland, grassland and woodland.
The woods are well established and varied,
with an oak plantation, and other areas of mixed species.
Right.
The wetland is quite varied, too.
The original farmland was dug up around 40 years ago to extract gravel.
Once this work was completed,
the gravel pits filled with water, forming the two large lakes.
There are also several smaller ones, ponds and a stream that flows through the park.
Okay, so I suppose with these different habitats there's quite a variety of wildlife.
There certainly is.
A lot of different species of birds and insects,
and also animals like deer and rabbits.
And I understand you organise educational visits for school parties.
That's right.
We can organise a wide range of activities and adapt them to suit all ages.
Can you give me some examples of the activities?
Well, one focus is on science,
where we help children to discover and study plants, trees and insects.
They also collect and analyse data about the things they see.
Another focus is on geography.
The park is a great environment to learn and practise reading a map
and using a compass to navigate around the park.
Do you do anything connected with history?
Yes, we do.
For instance, the children can explore how the use of the land has changed over time.
Then there's leisure and tourism.
That focuses on your visitors, I would imagine.
Yes, mostly.
The children find out about them,
their requirements, the problems they may cause and how we manage these.
And another subject we cover is music:
here the children experiment with natural materials to create sounds
and explore rhythm and tempo.
That must be fun!
Most children really enjoy it.
And of course, all the activities are educational, too.
Learning outside the classroom encourages children to be creative,
and to explore and discover for themselves.
I would imagine they get a sense of freedom that might not be a normal part of their lives.
That's right.
And very often the children discover that they can do things they didn't know they could do,
and they develop new skills.
This gives them greater self-confidence.
It sounds great.
So, what about the practical side of it?
How much does it cost for a full-day visit?
We would expect to bring between 30 and 40 children.
If there are over 30,
it costs ¬£4.95 for each child who attends on the day.
We invoice you afterwards,
so you don't pay for children who can't come because of sickness, for example.
There's no charge for leaders and other adults - as many as you want to bring.
That sounds very fair.
Well, thanks for all the information.
I'll need to discuss it with my colleagues,
and I hope to get back to you soon to make a booking.
We'll look forward to hearing from you.
Goodbye.

And everyone enjoyed the demonstration of French cookery,
which was nearly as successful.
Numbers for our film show were limited because of the venue
so we're looking for somewhere bigger next year.
We're looking forward to welcoming our French visitors here next week,
and I know that many of you here will be hosting individuals or families.
The coach from France will arrive at 5 pm on Friday.
Don't try to do too much that first evening as they'll be tired,
so have dinner in the house or garden rather than eating out.
The weather looks as if it'll be okay
so you might like to plan a barbecue.
Then the next morning's market day in town,
and that's always a good place to stroll round.
On Saturday evening, we'll all meet up at the football club,
where once again we'll have Toby Sharp and his band
performing English and Scottish country songs.
Toby will already be well known to many of you
as last year he organised our special quiz night and presented the prizes.
Now on Sunday, we'll be taking our visitors to Farley House.
You may not all be familiar with it, so here's a map to help you.
You can see the car park at the bottom of the map.
There's an excellent farm shop in the grounds where our visitors can buy local produce,
it's in the old stables, which is the first building you come to.
They're built round a courtyard, and the shop's in the far corner on the left.
There's also a small caf√© on the right as you go in.
I know that one or two of our visitors may not be all that mobile.
The main entrance to the house has a lot of steps
so you might want to use the disabled entry.
This is on the far side of the house from the car park.
Children will probably be most interested in the adventure playground.
That's at the northern end of the larger lake,
in a bend on the path that leads to the lake.
There's lots for children to do there.
There are a number of lovely gardens near the house.
The kitchen gardens are rectangular and surrounded by a wall.
They're to the north-east of the house, quite near the smaller lake.
They're still in use and have a great collection of fruit and vegetables.
The Temple of the Four Winds is a bit more of a walk,
but it's worth it.
Take the path from the car park
and go past the western sides of the stables and the house.
Then when the path forks, take the right-hand path.
Go up there with the woods on your left and the temple is right at the end.
There are great views over the whole area.

992,Cam19 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam19---test-1---part-3,75,"I haven't seen you for a bit, Marie.
No. I've been busy with my project.
You're making a vegan alternative to eggs, aren't you?
Something that doesn't use animal products?
Yes. I'm using chickpeas.
I had two main aims when I first started looking for an alternative to eggs,
but actually I've found chickpeas have got more advantages.
But how about your project on reusing waste food?
You were looking at bread, weren't you?
Yes. It's been hard work, but I've enjoyed it.
The basic process was quite straightforward:
breaking the stale bread down to a paste then reforming it.
But you were using 3-D printing, weren't you, to make the paste into biscuits?
Yeah, I'd used that before,
but in this project, I had time to play around with different patterns for the biscuits
and finding how I could add fruit and vegetables to make them a more appetising colour,
and I was really pleased with what I managed to produce.
It must've been a great feeling to make something appetising out of bits of old bread that would've been thrown away otherwise.
It was.
And I'm hoping that some of the restaurants in town will be interested in the biscuits.
I'm going to send them some samples.
I came across something on the internet yesterday that might interest you.
It was a company that's developed touch-sensitive sensors for food labels.
It's a special sort of label on the food package.
When the label's smooth, the food is fresh
and then when you can feel bumps on the label,
that means the food's gone bad.
It started off as a project to help visually impaired people know whether food was fit to eat or not.
Interesting.
So just solid food?
No, things like milk and juice as well.
But actually, I thought it might be really good for drug storage in hospitals and pharmacies.
Right.
And coming back to food,
maybe it'd be possible to use it for other things besides freshness.
Like how many kilograms a joint of meat is, for example.
Yes, there's all sorts of possibilities.
I was reading an article about food trends
predicting how eating habits might change in the next few years.
Oh... things like more focus on local products?
That seems so obvious, but the shops are still full of imported foods.
Yes, they need to be more proactive to address that.
And somehow motivate consumers to change, yes.
One thing everyone's aware of is the need for a reduction in unnecessary packaging
but just about everything you buy in supermarkets is still covered in plastic.
The government needs to do something about it.
Absolutely. It's got to change.
Do you think there'll be more interest in gluten- and lactose-free food?
For people with allergies or food intolerances?
I don't know.
Lots of people I know have been buying that type of food for years now.
Yes, even if they haven't been diagnosed with an allergy.
That's right.
One thing I've noticed is the number of branded products related to celebrity chefs.
People watch them cooking on TV
and then buy things like spice mixes or frozen foods with the chef's name on...
I bought something like that once, but I won't again.
Yeah I bought a ready-made spice mix for chicken
which was supposed to be used by a chef I'd seen on television,
and it didn't actually taste of anything.
Did the article mention 'ghost kitchens' used to produce takeaway food?
No. What are they?
Well, they might have the name of a restaurant,
but actually they're a cooking facility just for delivery meals.
The public don't ever go there.
But people aren't aware of that.
It's all kept very quiet.
So people don't realise the food's not actually from the restaurant?
Right.
Did you know more and more people are using all sorts of different mushrooms now,
to treat different health concerns?
Things like heart problems?
Hmm. They might be taking a big risk there.
Yes, it's hard to know which varieties are safe to eat.
Anyway...

993,Cam19 - Test 1 - Part 4,C1,cam19---test-1---part-4,62,"For my presentation today, I'm going to talk about the Ceide Fields in the northwest of Ireland,
one of the largest Neolithic sites in the world.
I recently visited this site
and observed the work that is currently being done by a team of archaeologists there.
The site was first discovered in the 1930s
by a local teacher, Patrick Caulfield.
He noticed that when local people were digging in the bog,
they were constantly hitting against what seemed to be rows of stones.
He realised that these must be walls
and that they must be thousands of years old for them to predate the bog which subsequently grew over them.
He wrote to the National Museum in Dublin to ask them to investigate,
but no one took him seriously.
It wasn't until 40 years later,
when Patrick Caulfield's son Seamus, who had become an archaeologist by then, began to explore further.
He inserted iron probes into the bog to map the formation of the stones,
a traditional method which local people had always used for finding fuel buried in the bog for thousands of years.
Carbon dating later proved that the site was over 5,000 years old
and was the largest Neolithic site in Ireland.
Thanks to the bog which covers the area,
the remains of the settlement at Ceide Fields, which is over 5,000 years old,
are extremely well-preserved.
A bog is 90% water;
its soil is so saturated that when the grasses and heathers that grow on its surface die,
they don't fully decay but accumulate in layers.
Objects remain so well preserved in these conditions
because of the acidity of the peat and the deficiency of oxygen.
At least 175 days of rain a year are required for this to happen;
this part of Ireland gets an average of 225 days.
The Neolithic farmers at Ceide would have enjoyed several centuries of relative peace and stability.
Neolithic farmers generally lived in larger communities than their predecessors,
with a number of houses built around a community building.
As they lived in permanent settlements,
Neolithic farmers were able to build bigger houses.
These weren't round as people often assume,
but rectangular with a small hole in the roof that allowed smoke to escape.
This is one of many innovations
and indicates that the Neolithic farmers were the first people to cook indoors.
Another new technology that Neolithic settlers brought to Ireland was pottery.
Fragments of Neolithic pots have been found in Ceide and elsewhere in Ireland.
The pots were used for many things;
as well as for storing food,
pots were filled with a small amount of fat
and when this was set alight, they served as lamps.
It's thought that the Ceide Fields were mainly used as paddocks for animals to graze in.
Evidence from the Ceide Fields suggests that each plot of land was of a suitable size to sustain an extended family.
They may have used a system of rotational grazing
in order to prevent over-grazing
and to allow for plant recovery and regrowth.
This must've been a year-round activity
as no structures have been found which would have been used to shelter animals in the winter.
However, archaeologists believe that this way of life at Ceide ceased abruptly.
Why was this?
Well, several factors may have contributed to the changing circumstances.
The soil would have become less productive and led to the abandonment of farming.
The crop rotation system was partly responsible for this
as it would have been very intensive and was not sustainable.
But there were also climatic pressures too.
The farmers at Ceide would have enjoyed a relatively dry period,
but this began to change
and the conditions became wetter as there was a lot more rain.
It was these conditions that encouraged the bog to form over the area which survives today.
So now I'd like to show you...

994,Cam19 - Test 2 - Part 1,B1,cam19---test-2---part-1,93,"Hi Coleman, how are you?
Good, thanks.
I wanted to have a chat with you
because our friend Josh told me that you've joined a guitar group
and it sounds interesting.
I'd really like to learn myself.
Why don't you come along?
I'm sure there's room for another person.
Really?
So... who runs the classes?
He's called a 'coordinator',
his name's Gary Mathieson.
Let me note that down.
Gary....
How do you spell his surname?
It's Mathieson.
Right, thanks.
He's retired, actually, but he's a really nice guy
and he used to play in a lot of bands.
Thanks.
So how long have you been going?
About a month now.
And could you play anything before you started?
I knew a few chords, but that's all.
I'm sure everyone will be better than me.
That's what I thought, too.
When I first spoke to Gary on the phone,
he said it was a class for beginners,
but I was still worried that everyone would be better than me,
but we were all equally hopeless!
Oh, that's reassuring.
So where do you meet?
Well, when I joined the group, they were meeting in Gary's home,
but as the group got bigger, he decided to book a room at the college in town.
I prefer going there.
I know that place.
I used to go to tap dancing classes there when I was at secondary school.
I haven't been since, though and I can't remember what road it's in...
Is it Lock Street?
It's just beyond there at the bottom of New Street near the city roundabout.
Yes, of course.
The guitar club is on the first floor in Room T347.
Right.
And when do you meet?
Is it at the weekend?
We meet on Thursdays.
It used to be 10.30 and that suited me well,
but now we meet at 11.
The class that's in there before us asked if they could have the room for another 30 minutes.
Oh, I see.
Well, I'd love to come, but I don't have a guitar.
Well, you can always buy a second-hand one.
There's a website called 'The perfect instrument' that sells all kinds of guitars, violins and so on.
I'm sure you'll find something there.
So what's a typical lesson like with Gary?
Well, he always starts by getting us to tune our guitars.
That takes about five minutes.
Uhuh...
Some people have an app they use, but others do it by ear.
Gary goes round and helps them.
And while he's doing that, he tells us what he's going to do during the lesson.
Right.
First, we usually spend about ten minutes doing some strumming.
So is that using...
Oh... what are they called...
Plectrums?
No, we just use our thumbs.
Oh... much easier.
Gary reminds us where to put our fingers for each chord and then we play them together.
Sometimes we all just start laughing because we're so bad at keeping time,
so Gary starts clapping to help us.
Do you learn to play any songs?
Yes, we do at least one song with words and chords.
I mean that's harder than you think.
Oh, I'm sure it is!
That part of the lesson takes about 15 minutes.
He often brings a recording of the song and plays it to us first.
Then he hands out the song and if there's a new chord in it,
we practise that before we play it together, but really slowly.
Do you do any finger picking?
That's the last ten minutes of the lesson,
when we pick out the individual notes from a tune he's made up.
It's always quite simple.
That must be hard, though.
It is.
But people like it because they can really concentrate
and if we're all playing well, it sounds quite impressive.
The only trouble is that he sometimes gets us to play one at a time, you know, alone.
Oh... that's scary.
Um... it is, but I've got used to it now.
At the end he spends about five minutes telling us what to practise for the following week.
Well, thanks Coleman.
I'll go and have a look at that website, I think.

995,Cam19 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam19---test-2---part-2,62,"I never really planned to be a lifeboat volunteer when I came to live in Northsea.
I'd been working in London as a website designer,
but although that was interesting, I didn't like city life.
I'd been really keen on boats as a teenager,
and I thought if I went to live by the sea.
I might be able to pursue that interest a bit more in my free time.
Then I found that the Lifeboat Institution was looking for volunteers,
so I decided to apply.
The Lifeboat Institution building here in Northsea's hard to miss,
it's one of the largest in the country.
It was built 15 years ago with funds provided by a generous member of the public who'd lived here all her life.
As the Lifeboat Institution is a charity that relies on that kind of donation,
rather than funding provided by the government,
that was a huge help to us.
When I applied, I had to have a health assessment.
The doctors were particularly interested in my vision.
I used to be short-sighted,
so I'd had to wear glasses,
but I'd had laser eye surgery two years earlier so that was okay.
They gave me tests for colour blindness
and they thought I might have a problem there,
but it turned out I was okay.
When the coastguard gets an alert,
all the volunteers are contacted and rush to the lifeboat station.
Our target's to get there in five minutes,
then we try to get the boat off the dock and out to sea in another six to eight minutes.
Our team's proud that we usually achieve that.
The average time across the country's 8.5 minutes.
I've recently qualified as what's called a 'helmsman',
which means I have the ultimate responsibility for the lifeboat.
I have to check that the equipment we use is in working order,
the crew have special life jackets that can support up to four people in the water.
And it's ultimately my decision whether it's safe to launch the boat.
But it's very rare not to launch it, even in the worst weather.
As well as going out on the lifeboat, my work involves other things too.
A lot of people underestimate how quickly conditions can change at sea,
so I speak to youth groups and sailing clubs in the area
about the sorts of problems that sailors and swimmers can have if the weather suddenly gets bad.
We also have a lot of volunteers who organise activities to raise money for us,
and we couldn't manage without them.
The training we get is a continuous process,
focusing on technical competence and safe handling techniques,
and it's given me the confidence to deal with extreme situations without panicking.
I was glad I'd done a first aid course before I started,
as that's a big help with the casualty care activities we do.
We've done a lot on how to deal with ropes and tie knots,
that's an essential skill.
After a year, I did a one-week residential course, led by specialists.
They had a wave-tank where they could create extreme weather conditions,
so we could get experience of what to do if the boat turned over in a storm at night, for example.
Since I started, I've had to deal with a range of emergency situations.
But the work's hugely motivating.
It's not just about saving lives.
I've learned a lot about the technology involved.
My background in IT's been useful here,
and I can use my expertise to help other volunteers.
They're a great group, we're like a family really,
which helps when you're dragging yourself out of bed on a cold stormy night.
But actually, it's the colder months that can be the most rewarding time.
That's when the incidents tend to be more serious,
and you realise that you can make a huge difference to the outcome.
So if any of you listeners are interested....

996,Cam19 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam19---test-2---part-3,84,"Hi Don.
Did you get the copy of the article on recycling footwear that I emailed you?
Yeah it's here...
I've had a look at it.
So do you think it's a good topic for our presentation?
Well, before I started reading it, I thought recycling footwear...
well, although it's quite interesting, perhaps there isn't enough to say about it,
cos we put shoes in recycling bins, they go to charity shops and that's about it.
But there's much more to it than that.
I realise that now and I'm keen to research the topic more.
That's great.
One of the things I didn't realise until I read the article was just how many pairs of trainers get recycled!
Well, a lot of young people wear them all the time now.
They've become more popular than ordinary shoes.
I know.
I guess they are very hard-wearing,
but don't they look a bit casual for school uniform?
I don't think they're right for that.
Actually, I think some of them look quite smart on pupils...
Better than a scruffy old pair of shoes.
So do you keep shoes a long time?
Yes.
Though I do tend to wear my old pairs for doing dirty jobs like cleaning my bike.
I must admit,
I've recycled some perfectly good shoes, that haven't gone out of fashion and still fit,
just because they don't look great on me anymore.
That's awful, isn't it?
I think it's common because there's so much choice.
The article did say that recent sales of footwear have increased enormously.
That didn't surprise me.
No.
But then it said that the amount of recycled footwear has fallen:
it's 6% now compared to a previous level of 11%.
That doesn't seem to make sense.
That's because not everything goes through the recycling process.
Some footwear just isn't good enough to re-sell, for one reason or another, and gets rejected.
So let's find some examples in the article of footwear that was rejected for recycling.
Okay.
I think there are some in the interview with the recycling manager.
Yeah... here it is.
Let's start with the ladies' high-heeled shoes.
What did he say about those?
He said they were probably expensive.
The material was suede and they were beige in colour.
It looked like someone had only worn them once, but in a very wet field
so the heels were too stained with mud and grass to re-sell them.
Okay...
And the leather ankle boots.
What was wrong with them?
Apparently, the heels were worn
but that wasn't the problem.
One of the shoes was a much lighter shade than the other one.
It'd obviously been left in the sun.
I suppose even second-hand shoes should look the same!
Sure.
Then there were the red baby shoes.
Oh yes...
we're told to tie shoes together when we put them in a recycling bin,
but people often don't bother.
You'd think it would have been easy to find the other, but it wasn't.
That was a shame because they were obviously new.
The trainers were interesting.
He said they looked like they'd been worn by a marathon runner.
Yeah... weren't they split?
Not exactly.
One of the soles was so worn under the foot that you could put your finger through it.
Well, we could certainly use some of those examples in our presentation to explain why 90% of shoes that people take to recycling centres or bins get thrown into landfill.
What did you think about the project his team set up to avoid this by making new shoes out of the good parts of old shoes?
It sounded like a good idea.
They get so many shoes, they should be able to match parts.
I wasn't surprised that it failed, though.
I mean who wants to buy second-hand shoes really?
Think of all the germs you could catch!
Well, people didn't refuse them for that reason, did they?
It was because the pairs of shoes weren't identical.
They still managed to ship them overseas, though.
That's another area we need to discuss.
You know I used to consider this topic just from my own perspective,
by thinking about my own recycling behaviour without looking at the bigger picture.
So much happens once shoes leave the recycling area.
It's not as simple as you first think,
and we can show that by taking a very different approach to it.
Absolutely.
So let's discuss...
",https://dailydictation.com/upload/ielts-listening/cam-19-test-2-part-3-2024-06-21-00-22-45/0-cam-19-test-2-part-3_v3.mp3,4,51
997,Cam19 - Test 2 - Part 4,C1,cam19---test-2---part-4,73,"For my project on invertebrates, I chose to study tardigrades.
These are microscopic, or to be more precise, near-microscopic animals.
There are well over a thousand known species of these tiny animals,
which belong to the phylum Tardigrada.
Most tardigrades range in length from 0.05 to 1 millimetre,
though the largest species can grow to be 1.2 millimetres in length.
They are also sometimes called 'water bears':
'water' because that's where they thrive best,
and 'bear' because of the way they move.
'Moss piglet' is another name for tardigrades
because of the way they look when viewed from the front.
They were first discovered in Germany in 1773 by Johann Goeze,
who coined the name Tardigrada.
As I say, there are many different species of tardigrade,
too many to describe here, but generally speaking, the different species share similar physical traits.
They have a body which is short, and also rounded, a bit like a barrel,
and the body comprises four segments.
Each segment has a pair of legs,
at the end of which are between four and eight sharp claws.
I should also say that some species don't have any claws;
what they have are discs,
and these work by means of suction.
They enable the tardigrade to cling on to surfaces or to grip its prey.
Within the body, there are no lungs, or any organs for breathing at all.
Instead, oxygen and also blood are transported in a fluid that fills the cavity of the body.
As far as the tardigrade's head is concerned,
the best way I can describe this is that it looks rather strange, a bit squashed even,
though many of the websites I looked at described its appearance as cute,
which isn't exactly very scientific.
The tardigrade's mouth is a kind of tube
that can open outwards to reveal teeth-like structures known as 'stylets'.
These are sharp enough to pierce plant or animal cells.
So, where are tardigrades found?
Well, they live in every part of the world,
in a variety of habitats: most commonly, on the bed of a lake,
or on many kinds of plants or in very wet environments.
There's been some interesting research which has found that tardigrades are capable of surviving radiation
and very high pressure,
and they're also able to withstand temperatures as cold as -200 degrees centigrade,
or highs of more than 148 degrees centigrade,
which is incredibly hot.
It has been said that tardigrades could survive long after human beings have been wiped out,
even in the event of an asteroid hitting the earth.
If conditions become too extreme and tardigrades are at risk of drying out,
they enter a state called cryptobiosis.
They curl into a ball, called a tun,
that's T-U-N- by retracting their head and legs,
and their metabolism drops to less than one percent of normal levels.
They can remain like this until they are re-introduced to water,
when they will come back to life in a matter of a few hours.
While in a state of cryptobiosis, tardigrades produce a protein that protects their DNA.
In 2016, scientists revived two tardigrades that had been tuns for more than 30 years.
There was a report that, in 1948,
a 120-year-old tun was revived,
but this experiment has never been repeated.
There are currently several tests taking place in space,
to determine how long tardigrades might be able to survive there.
I believe the record so far is 10 days.
So, erm, moving on.
In terms of their diet, tardigrades consume liquids in order to survive.
Although they have teeth, they don't use these for chewing.
They suck the juices from moss, or extract fluid from seaweed,
but some species prey on other tardigrades,
from other species or within their own.
I suppose this isn't surprising, given that tardigrades are mainly comprised of liquid and are coated with a type of gel.
Finally, I'd like to mention the conservation status of tardigrades.
It is estimated that they have been in existence for approximately half a billion years
and, in that time, they have survived five mass extinctions.
So, it will probably come as no surprise to you,
that tardigrades have not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
and are not on any endangered list.
Some researchers have described them as thriving.
Does anyone have any questions they'd like to ask?

Really well, thanks.
You look like you're going shopping.
Yes, I am.
My cousins are coming to stay for a couple of days, and I have to cook for them.
Well, there are plenty of places to buy food in Kite Place,
it's the area by the harbour.
Oh, okay, I'll find that on the map.
Thanks.
What sort of food do you need to get?
Well, neither of them eats meat but they both like fish.
Well, there's a really good fish market there.
Oh great!
Where is it exactly?
It's at the far end of Kite Place,
so you have to go over the bridge and then it's on the right.
Okay, is it open all day?
It doesn't close until four,
but I'd recommend going earlier than that,
it does run out of some things.
Oh, I don't want that to happen.
As long as you get there by 3:30, you should be fine.
It's only 11 now, so plenty of time.
Right.
Do you need to buy vegetables too?
I do, and I want to avoid all the plastic packaging in the supermarket!
Well, there's a really nice organic shop there.
Now what's it called...
It's the name of a flower.
I know, it's 'Rose'.
Oh, that's a nice name.
Yeah, it sells vegetables and quite a lot of other stuff.
And where's that?
Well, as you reach the market,
you'll see a big grey building on your left,
I think it used to be a warehouse.
Anyway, now it's a restaurant upstairs,
but the ground floor has two shops either side of the entrance and it's the one on the left.
That's easy enough.
You can't miss it,

I guess if I need anything else, I'll have to go to the supermarket.
Yeah, you should be able to get everything you need,
but there's a minibus that goes to the supermarket if you need it.
It's purple and the number is 289.
Thanks, that's great.
So what do you need to get at the fish market?
The salmon is always very good and the shellfish...
I'm going to make a curry, I think,
and I need about 12 prawns for that.
They'll have plenty of those.
Have you ever tried samphire?
No, what's that?
It's a type of seaweed.
I just ask for a handful and you fry it in butter.
It's delicious!
Oh, I might try that,
how do you spell it?
It's SAMPHIRE.
Great! It's always good to try something different.
I'll see what beans they have in the organic shop
and I think I'll get something for dessert there.
How about a mango?
I'm not sure, they're not always ripe.
I'd prefer a melon, it's bigger too.
Good idea.
The owner also sells a lot of spices there that you can put in a curry,
and things like coconut.
Oh, that's very helpful.
I'll have a look.
No problem.
I know bread doesn't really go with curry
but I always like to have some in case.
As I said, all the bread is home-made and there's lots of variety.
I like the brown bread myself.
Mm, sounds good.
They sell other things there too.
Like cakes?
I love chocolate cake.
Well, not that,
but they have a whole range of tarts
and the best are the strawberry ones.
Perfect!
Hopefully I won't even have to go to the supermarket!

999,Cam19 - Test 3 - Part 2,B1,cam19---test-3---part-2,57,"The children's book festival is coming up again soon
and here to tell us all about it is the festival's organiser, Jenny Morgan.
So tell us what we can expect this year, Jenny.
Well, as usual we've got five days of action-packed exciting events for children,
with writers coming from all over the country getting involved.
Just to give you an idea of what's on offer in the workshops,
first of all, there's a very special event called Superheroes.
This is a chance for deaf children to share their reading experiences with author Madeleine Gordon,
who is herself hearing impaired.
'Just do it' is a practical workshop led by the well-known illustrator Mark Keane.
He'll take participants on a magical journey to faraway lands
with an opportunity for aspiring actors to do some role play.
'Count on me' is an inspiring and entertaining look at the issues of friendship for 13 to 14-year-olds.
It looks at some of the friendships described in popular books
and asks participants to compare these with their own experiences.
'Speak up' is part of a series of workshops on the subject of mental health.
This is a creative writing workshop encouraging children to describe situations
where young people experience loneliness.
A recent survey revealed that children can be lonely
even when they're at home with their families.
'Jump for joy', as many of you will know,
is the heart-warming, best-selling story by Nina Karan
about a young girl's trip to visit her relatives in India.
It recently received the gold medal at the Waterford Awards.
Nina will get children to celebrate the word 'joy' by writing a poem.
'Sticks and stones' is the beautifully illustrated picture book for young readers
about a community who organise an African-Caribbean festival
to help local children learn about their Jamaican roots.
This will be a musical event where children will have the chance to play steel drums.
This is bound to be very popular, so please book as soon as possible.
Thanks Jenny. That all sounds really interesting.
I'm just wondering if you have a favourite book you could recommend for our readers?
It's hard to choose, but 'Alive and Kicking' is definitely worth mentioning.
You won't have heard of the writer as it's her first book - which is really impressive.
It's basically the teenage diary of a boy from Somalia who comes to live in the UK.
It deals with the serious issue of immigration
and all the challenges the boy has to face at school and with the language barrier, etc.
Usually, books like this are quite sad,
but this one actually made me cry with laughter.
On each page, there are simple but hilarious black and white stick drawings of the boy with his friends and teachers.
At the end of each diary entry, there are new English words the boy learns each day,
which may help develop some children's vocabulary.
I think my kids would enjoy that.
What about any advice for parents on how to encourage their children to read more?
Well, this is something I get asked about a lot.
There are so many distractions for kids these days that it can be hard to find time for reading.
One thing I'd say is to make time to sit down with your child and share books with them.
A lot of parents give up reading aloud to their children as soon as they learn to read independently,
but this is a mistake.
It's good to read more advanced books to them as it helps to develop their vocabulary.
If you don't have time for this, then let them listen to audio books.
Often, they'll want to read books they've listened to for themselves.
I think it's a good idea to make a mental note of the type of books your child is reading.
Often, they just read the same genre all the time, which can get a bit boring.
You can introduce new authors and genres to them.
Librarians should be able to help you with this.
Well Jenny, I think...

1000,Cam19 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam19---test-3---part-3,96,"Hi Jake.
How are you getting on with the practical teaching?
Ah... it's harder than I expected, but I've got some great classes.
How about you?
Not brilliant.
I'm really struggling with my Year 12 science class.
Are they hard to control?
Well, I don't have discipline problems as such.
It's just that they don't seem to think that science has anything to do with their lives.
It's depressing.
They listen to what I say,
and I gave them a test last week and the results weren't too bad,
but there's no real engagement.
Right.
And as part of my teaching practice, I have to design an experiment for them to do.
I was wondering about something on the children's diets...
You know, asking them to record what they eat and maybe linking it to their state of health.
Mmm. Let's think.
So your methodology would involve the children recording what they eat.
Okay, but you'd also need to have access to the children's medical records
and I don't think people would be happy about that;
confidentiality would be an issue.
If you could get the right data, the conclusions might be significant,
but I suspect it's not going to be easy.
Right.
Have you thought about doing an experiment using animals?
Wouldn't that be upsetting for the children?
Well, the animals don't have to be harmed in any way.
It could just be an experiment where they're given a certain diet and the effects are observed.
Would I have to get permission to use animals?
Yes, you'd have to submit an outline of the experiment and fill in a form,
but it's quite straightforward.
But if we found out that, say, a particular diet affects the health of animals,
the same thing wouldn't necessarily be true for people, would it?
No, that's true,
but the findings for any experiment are going to be limited.
It's inevitable.
I suppose so.
So what animals could I use to investigate the effects of diet?
Mice?
Yes.
You'd need experimental mice - ones that have been specially bred for experiments.
Okay, so what will your experiment be investigating exactly?
Well, something to do with nutrition.
So maybe we could look at food supplements...
Things like extra iron and extra protein, and their impact on health.
Mmm. That might be rather broad.
Maybe just look at the effects of one supplement, like sugar, on the health of the mice?
In fact, maybe the focus could be on whether mice can control their own diet.
So, what happens when they have access to more sugar that they don't really need?
Exactly.
Do they eat it or do they decide to leave it?
Great.
Then later on, you could do a follow-up experiment adding another variable.
Like, you could give some of the mice the chance to be more active,
running on a wheel or something,
and the others just sit around and don't do much.
Or I could repeat the experiment but change the type of food I provided...
or use mice with a different genetic structure.
But I think your idea would be more interesting,
I might think about that some more.
So can I talk through a possible procedure for the experiment where mice are given a sugar supplement?
Sure.
I did a similar experiment in college actually.
Great.
So how many mice would I need?
I'd say about 12.
And all young ones, not a mixture of old and young.
Okay.
And I'd need two groups of equal sizes, so six in each group.
And how would I tell them apart?
I suppose I could put some sort of tag on one group... or just mark them in some way?
You could use food colouring, that wouldn't hurt them.
Perfect.
Then each group would go into a separate cage,
and one group, let's call them group A, would be the control group.
So they'd just have ordinary mouse food.
I suppose you can buy that?
Yes, it comes in dry pellets.
And the other group would have the same as the first group,
but they'd also have the extra sugar.
Would you just give them straight sugar?
It might be better to give them something like cereal with it.
Mmm. Then you'd need to weigh the mice, I should think once a week.
And you'd need an electronic balance.
But we can't hold them on the balance, or it'd affect the reading.
Exactly.
So you need something called a weighing chamber to stop the mice from running away.
It sounds complicated, but actually you can just use a plastic box with holes in the top.
Okay.
So once we've measured the weight gain of each mouse
we can work out the average for each group, as well as the standard deviation.
And then see where we go from there.
That sounds cool!
I think the students will enjoy it.
Yes. One thing...

1001,Cam19 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam19---test-3---part-4,54,"In today's lecture, I'm going to be talking about microplastics.
Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic smaller than five millimetres in size.
Recently, there's been a greater awareness that there are large quantities of plastic waste - big and small - in the environment.
The amount of plastic waste in the oceans has received widespread attention,
but far less is known about the effects of microplastics in freshwater and particularly in soil.
Microplastics can enter the environment via a number of different sources.
Threads and microfibres detach from synthetic clothing every time they're put in a washing machine,
and these find their way into the water system.
Other sources include big pieces of plastic waste that are already in the environment,
and these break down into microscopic particles over a period of time.
On a larger scale, factory waste is another route,
as are tyres which wear down as cars, lorries and so on travel along road surfaces.
We already understand some of the impacts of microplastics from studies involving fish and other animals.
There is evidence that microplastics harm small creatures in a variety of ways,
such as by damaging their mouths,
or by impairing their ability to feed,
for example, when microplastics get lodged in their digestive system.
Surprisingly perhaps, it is likely that humans consume microplastics,
as these have been detected in a wide range of food and drink products, including bottled water,
as well as in water that comes direct from the tap.
What's more, salt and many kinds of seafood have also been found to contain microplastics.
However, it's important to underline that there is not yet conclusive proof
that microplastics cause significant harm to people.
In many countries, including here in the UK,
there is legislation which prevents manufacturers from adding plastic microbeads to shower gels, facial cleansers and toothpaste.
It is very difficult to accurately estimate the total amount of microplastic particles in the soil
as they can be hard to detect,
but we do know they are carried in the air and deposited in the soil by rain.
What's more, many of the fertilisers used by both farmers and gardeners contain microplastics.
A team from the Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge
has carried out a study of the effects of microplastics on the digestive tracts of earthworms.
These worms, which live in topsoil, are an essential component of our agricultural system.
By feeding on soil, they mix nutrients into it, thereby making it more fertile.
The researchers set out to discover whether the introduction of microplastics into the soil,
and the subsequent ingestion of these by earthworms,
would impact soil quality and ultimately inhibit plant growth.
The short answer was, yes, it did.
After placing three different types of microplastic particles into the soil,
they planted perennial rye grass.
The particles of microplastic, which included biodegradable PLA and conventional high-density polyethylene, or HDPE,
were then ingested by the earthworms in the soil.
The result was that the worms lost weight rapidly.
What's more, a lower percentage than normal of the rye grass seeds germinated,
and the researchers concluded
that this was a direct result of the earthworms being unable to fulfil their normal role in making soil more fertile.
The team also discovered that there was an increase in the amount of acid found in the soil,
and this was attributed mainly to the microplastic particles from conventional HDPE plastic.
The conclusions of the study make for very interesting reading.
I've included the reference in the notes to give you at the end of this session.
To summarise, the authors proposed the idea that we need to regard soil as we would regard any other process in nature.
This means we should accept the implications of soil being dependent on decaying and dead matter
constantly being passed through the bodies of earthworms.
That is, when soil becomes impoverished by the presence of microplastics,
not only ecosystems but also the whole of society are negatively impacted.

1002,Cam19 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam19---test-4---part-1,87,"Hello Charlotte.
I'm Kaeden, one of the supervisors.
Welcome to the team.
Hi Aiden.
It's Kaeden.
I'm so sorry.
Don't worry.
People often get my name wrong;
they never know how to spell it.
It's KAEDEN, in case you ever need to write it.
I'll try and remember.
So, there are a few practical things you need to sort out this morning.
Then I'll show you what you're going to do today.
Ah... the email I received said to go to the front desk, to show my letter of appointment and pick up my badge.
You'll need that for the staffroom and other areas of the supermarket where shoppers aren't allowed.
So, after you've finished at the front desk, I'll take you to the staffroom.
Put your coat and rucksack in one of the lockers there.
Take whichever one is free.
Will I have a key?
Yes. Try not to lose it.
At the end of the day, leave it in the door for the next person to use.
Will do.
You also need to go to the HR department to see Tiffany.
She's really helpful.
I was told to bring my passport with me.
HR need to take a note of the number in it.
That's right.
Or you can show your ID card.
I don't have one of those.
Okay. Tiffany will give you a uniform.
Ah... They have lots in different sizes, so you just tell her what you need.
I won't come with you to HR. I've got to go and sort something else out.
Uhm... problem with a bread slicer.
Is the HR office near the staffroom?
The staffroom's on the first floor, and HR are a couple of floors above that, on the third floor.
There's a staircase outside the staffroom.
Okay.
When you've finished with HR, come and find me in the bakery section of the shop.
I'm looking forward to getting started.
I'll just give you my phone number, in case you can't find me.
Ah... have you got your phone there?
Yes... Okay, ready.
It's 0412665903.
Okay, done.
So, Charlotte, your tasks today are in the bakery section,
on the sushi counter, and on the meat and fish counters.
The first job is to check sell-by dates on the bread and cakes.
If any of the dates are today's, put a new price label on the packaging.
What if any of the labels are yesterday's dates, or older?
Do I throw those items away?
Yes, but that shouldn't happen, we check the stock every day.
When something needs a new price label,
put a yellow one on the package, next to the original price.
Okay.
After that, you'll go to the sushi takeaway counter.
Will I be preparing boxes of food?
Ah... for today, you'll just be helping the staff.
Yes, of course.
You'll see lots of flat cardboard boxes at one end of the counter.
Beneath those is where we keep the plastic boxes,
we run out of those really quickly, so you should bring more from the storeroom.
Is that my only task on the sushi counter?
No. You also need to clean the area where they prepare the dishes.
There are cloths and bottles of spray by the sink.
Oh, and please make sure you clean that too.
Sure. That's important, isn't it?
Absolutely. But you mustn't wash up knives.
You have to do some training before you're allowed to touch sharp objects.
What should I do if there are any?
Ask someone to put them in the dishwasher.
Okay, thanks.
I don't want to get anything wrong.
Don't worry. You'll be fine.
And I'll be around to help.
Right.
Finally, the meat and fish counters.
You need to clean the area where staff serve customers,
including wiping the weighing scales.
Okay.
Anything else?
The fish is laid on ice, but when that starts to melt, you'll need to get more from the cold-room.
I know the staff on the food counters wear a hat.
Will that be the same for me?
You won't be serving customers directly, so no.
But make sure you put on thermal gloves when you take anything out of the cold-room.
The temperature's low enough in there to get frostbite from touching things.
Understood.

1003,Cam19 - Test 4 - Part 2,B1,cam19---test-4---part-2,65,"My name's Liz Fuller and I'm a running coach with Compton Park Runners Club.
Welcome to my podcast.
If you're thinking about taking up running - I'm here to help.
There are many training programmes available online which aim to help people build up to running 5 kilometres.
Some of them are great
and thousands of people of all ages are taking part in 5-kilometre races across the country as a result.
People like them because they're easy to follow and don't push them too hard.
However, they don't work for everyone,
especially if you suffer from something like a heart condition or asthma,
because they're aimed at people with average fitness and running ability.
Another thing is that everyone is different
and if you have any specific questions related to your needs,
there's no one to provide any answers.
I have a couple of simple tips I always give to new runners.
I expect you've been told to run very slowly until your fitness increases.
Well, I find that can prevent progress.
You should run at a speed that feels comfortable,
but time yourself and try to run a bit faster each time.
Listening to music can be very helpful.
It takes your mind off things and helps your body get into a rhythm.
I'd say that is better than running with a friend,
especially as most people are competitive
and that's not what you want when you're just starting.
I don't think the time of day is especially important.
Some people are better in the evening, while others are morning people
but you need to be consistent, so aim to train regularly.
Twice a week is enough to begin with.
New members often say to me that they've been put off running either because they lack confidence,
or they don't have time,
or they think they dislike running.
Ceri, for example, joined the club two years ago at the age of 40.
She'd always enjoyed running at school but wasn't sure if she'd be able to do it.
She was worried about being left behind and being the slowest runner.
But she says she was made to feel so welcome she soon forgot all about that.
James had always hated the idea of running
but a friend encouraged him to come along for a taster session
and he hasn't looked back.
He never misses a training session despite having a really demanding job.
Leo was worried about having to commit himself to training sessions every week
and wasn't sure he'd be able to fit training into his busy schedule.
But after experiencing a lot of stress at work
he came along to us and gave it a go.
Now he says he feels much more relaxed and he looks forward to his weekly run.
Mark is quite typical of our new members.
He's never considered himself to be a sporty person
and it was only when he retired that he decided to take up the challenge of trying to run 5 kilometres.
It took him months to find the courage to contact us but felt reassured immediately
as there were other people his age who were only just taking up running for the first time.
My own journey hasn't been easy.
I did my first marathon when I was 37, after having had two kids.
My husband had been running marathons for years,
but I never dreamed I'd be doing one with him.
I managed to complete it in four hours,
but I felt like giving up halfway through.
It was only the support of the spectators that kept me going.
I do think signing up for a race of whatever length is motivating
whether it's 5K or 25K
because it's good to have something to work towards
and it gives you a sense of achievement.
I did my first 10K after only six months,
which was certainly very challenging and not something I'd necessarily recommend.
But after you've been training for a few weeks, it's worth putting your name down for a 5K.
some people find they only need a few practice runs before taking part in a race,
but I'd give yourself a couple of months at least.
Well, I hope that's given...

Yes, I'm really looking forward to it
and I've just started packing up all my books to put in storage.
Well, I hope they don't get spoilt.
It's okay, my grandfather works in a bookshop
and he told me how to pack them.
Oh, that's helpful.
He says you have to support the spine
otherwise the paper can come away from the cover.
Yeah that's obvious.
He also told me to pack them flat in the box, not on their side,
again because they can bend
and if you leave them like that for, say, a year,
it's quite hard to get them back to their normal shape.
Well, it's pretty clear that ruins them,
but a lot of people just can't be bothered to protect their books.
He always says it's such a shame that publishers don't use better-quality paper.
It's the acid in the paper that causes the problem, isn't it?
Yeah, that's why old books go yellow.
You know some of the books my grandfather's given me are like that already.
I should dump them really if they're going to deteriorate further, but I'd feel bad.
They'll always remind me of him.
He's quite a collector, you know.
Well, if they're important to you...
Yeah, I'd regret just throwing them away.
You know, maybe it's because I was taught to treasure books...
But I hate seeing students force open the pages of paperbacks.
They press so hard they end up breaking the spine.
I know,
but unfortunately, paperbacks aren't designed to last a long time and people know that.
Hardbacks aren't quite as weak.
Yeah, they're different, I suppose.
But I still don't think people value hardbacks like they used to.
Well, they aren't decorative, are they, like other objects.
Plus, nowadays, people don't keep them out on shelves as much as they used to.
That's such a pity.
When I visit someone,
if they have, say, a colourful book on a table, it's the first thing I'm drawn to.
I agree,
and book covers can be a work of art in themselves.
Some are really eye-catching.
I've always been taught to handle books carefully.
If you watch someone take a book off a shelf, well, they usually do it wrong.
Ah, my grandfather says, you should put your hand right over the top of the book...
Or, if you can't do that,
pull the other books on the shelf aside so that you can hold the whole cover.
When did you learn all this?
He watched me pull a heavy book off the shelf when I was small,
and it fell on the floor and broke apart.
Oh dear!
Ah... I can still remember it!
You know what I really like?
What?
The smell of new books.
Me too.
My parents used to laugh at me when I was a kid because I loved putting books up to my nose.
Almost as much as reading them!
New books aren't cheap, though, are they?
I guess we're lucky we can buy them.
My grandfather stocks second-hand books as well as new ones
and they don't smell quite as good.
I'd love to have a bookshop like your grandfather.
What's it like?
Well, it's quite big.
It's got two floors and an attic,
and he stocks all kinds of books really.
I guess he treasures things like first editions and other rare books.
Yeah, you might think he'd keep those in the attic or somewhere...
So they'd be hidden?
Yeah.
But he likes people to know that he has them.
So, he puts them out in the shop but makes sure you need a ladder to get them.
Right. That would prevent any thefts!
Does he stock books for children?
He does.
He particularly likes to encourage kids to read;
he always says that he used to sit under the stairs as a child with a pile of books and read them all.
Is that where he keeps them, then?
Not exactly.
He's got a dedicated area on the ground floor with cushions
so that parents can enter with their toddlers,
go there and spend some time reading to them.
Oh cool.
And then there's a place for pushchairs by the front door.
And a caf√© if anyone needs refreshments.
That's good to know.
As I said, it's a big shop
and there's a storage area out the back as well.
Oh, what does he keep there?
Books he wants to throw away?
He hardly ever throws anything away.
He just leaves unwanted books by the front door for customers to take.
Well, that's very nice.
And books people or institutions have requested, they all go at the far end.
He thinks it's best to keep these out of the main shopping area as they're boxed and new.
Did you get your coursebooks from him?
Naturally.
He stocks books for a lot of the colleges.
He used to keep these books on the first floor,
but now there's a new university in my hometown,
he's moved them downstairs to attract the students.
They're actually part of the coffee shop, on low shelves all around it.
Pretty central then.
You'll have to take me there some time!

1005,Cam19 - Test 4 - Part 4,C1,cam19---test-4---part-4,75,"Tree planting now dominates political and popular agendas
and is often presented as an easy answer to the climate crisis,
as well as a way for business corporations to offset their carbon emissions.
But unfortunately, tree planting isn't as straightforward as some people think.
When the wrong trees are planted in the wrong place,
it can do considerably more damage than good,
failing to help either people or the environment.
Reforestation projects are currently being undertaken on a huge scale in many countries
and it's crucial that the right trees are selected.
A mix of species should always be planted,
typical of the local natural forest ecosystem
and including rare and endangered species in order to create a rich ecosystem.
It's important to avoid non-native species that could become invasive.
Invasive species are a significant contributor to the current global biodiversity crisis
and are often in competition with native species
and may threaten their long-term survival.
Restoring biodiversity that will maximise carbon capture is key when reforesting an area,
but ideally any reforestation project should have several goals.
These could include selecting trees that can contribute to wildlife conservation,
improve the availability of food for the local community
and maintain the stability of soil systems.
Meeting as many of these goals as possible,
whilst doing no harm to local communities, native ecosystems and vulnerable species,
is the sign of a highly successful tree-planting scheme.
To ensure the survival and resilience of a planted forest,
it's vital to use tree seeds with appropriate levels of genetic diversity:
the amount of genetic variation found within a species essential for their survival.
Using seeds with low genetic diversity generally lowers the resilience of restored forests,
which can make them vulnerable to disease and unable to adapt to climate change.
Choosing the right location for reforestation projects is as important as choosing the right trees.
Ultimately, the best area for planting trees would be in formerly forested areas that are in poor condition.
It's better to avoid non-forested landscapes such as natural grasslands, savannas or wetlands
as these ecosystems already contribute greatly to capturing carbon.
It would also be advantageous to choose an area where trees could provide other benefits,
such as recreational spaces.
Reforesting areas which are currently exploited for agriculture should be avoided
as this often leads to other areas being deforested.
Large-scale reforestation projects require careful planning.
Making the right decisions about where to plant trees depends on having the right information.
Having detailed and up-to-date maps identifying high-priority areas for intervention is essential.
Drone technology is a useful tool in helping to prioritise and monitor areas of degraded forest for restoration.
In Brazil, it's being used to identify and quantify how parts of the Amazon are being devastated by human activities
such as rearing cattle and illegal logging.
A good example of where the right trees were picked to achieve a restored forest
is in Lampang Province in Northern Thailand.
A previously forested site which had been degraded through mining
was reforested by a cement company together with Chiang Mai University.
After spreading 60 cm of topsoil,
they planted 14 different native tree species
which included several species of fig.
Figs are a keystone species
because of the critical role they play in maintaining wildlife populations.
They are central to tropical reforestation projects
as they accelerate the speed of the recovery process
by attracting animals and birds which act as natural seed dispersers.
This helps to promote diversity through the healthy regrowth of a wide range of plant species.
Unlike the majority of fruit trees,
figs bear fruit all year round, providing a reliable food source for many species.
At this site, for example, after only three rainy seasons,
monkeys started visiting to eat the fig fruits,
naturally dispersing seeds through defecation.
Reforestation projects should always aim to make sure that...
local communities are consulted and involved in the decision-making process.
The restoration of mangrove forests in Madagascar
is an example of a project which has succeeded in creating real benefits for the community.
Destruction of the mangrove forests had a terrible impact on plant and animal life,
and also badly affected the fishing industry,
which was a major source of employment for local people living in coastal areas.
The reforestation project involved hiring local people to plant and care for the new mangrove trees.
Millions of mangrove trees have now been planted
which has resulted in the return of a healthy aquatic ecosystem.
The mangroves also act as a defence against the increased threat of flooding caused by climate change.
What's more, the local economy is more stable
and thousands more Madagascans are now able to send their children to school.
One other important point...

1006,Cam18 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam18---test-1---part-1,78,"Excuse me.
Would you mind if I asked you some questions?
We're doing a survey on transport.
Yes, that's OK.
First of all, can I take your name?
Yes. It's Sadie Jones.
Thanks very much.
And could I have your date of birth - just the year will do, actually.
Is that alright?
Yes, that's fine.
It's 1991.
So, next, your postcode, please.
It's DW307YZ.
Great. Thanks.
Is that in Wells?
No it's actually in Harborne.
Wells isn't far from there, though.
I really like that area.
My grandmother lived there when I was a kid.
Yes, it is nice.
Right, so now I want to ask you some questions about how you travelled here today.
Did you use public transport?
Yes. I came by bus.
OK. And that was today.
It's the 24th of April, isn't it?
Isn't it the 25th?
Ah... no, actually, you're right.
And what was the reason for your trip today?
I can see you've got some shopping with you.
Yes. I did some shopping
but the main reason I came here was to go to the dentist.
That's not much fun.
Hope it was nothing serious.
No, it was just a check-up.
It's fine.
Good.
Do you normally travel by bus into the city centre?
Yes. I stopped driving in ages ago
because parking was so difficult to find
and it costs so much.
I see.
The bus is much more convenient too.
It only takes about 30 minutes.
That's good.
So where did you start your journey?
At the bus stop on Claxby Street.
Is that C-L-A-X-B-Y?
That's right.
And how satisfied with the service are you?
Do you have any complaints?
Well, as I said, it's very convenient and quick when it's on time,
but this morning it was late.
Only about 10 minutes, but still.
Yes, I understand that's annoying.
And what about the timetable?
Do you have any comments about that?
I suppose I mainly use the bus during the day,
but any time I've been in town in the evening, for dinner or at the cinema,
I've noticed you have to wait a long time for a bus.
There aren't that many.
OK, thanks.
So now I'd like to ask you about your car use.
Well, I have got a car but I don't use it that often.
Mainly just to go to the supermarket.
But that's about it really.
My husband uses it at the weekends to go to the golf club.
And what about a bicycle?
I don't actually have one at the moment.
What about the city bikes you can rent?
Do you ever use those?
No, I'm not keen on cycling there because of all the pollution.
But I would like to get a bike, it would be good to use it to get to work.
So why haven't you got one now?
Well, I live in a flat, on the second floor
and it doesn't have any storage,
so we'd have to leave it in the hall outside the flat.
I see.
OK. Well, I think that's all...

1007,Cam18 - Test 1 - Part 2,B2,cam18---test-1---part-2,52,"Good evening, everyone.
Let me start by welcoming you all to this talk and thanking you for taking the time to consider joining ACE voluntary organisation.
ACE offers support to people and services in the local area
and we're now looking for more volunteers to help us do this.
By the way, I hope you're all comfortable,
we have brought in extra seats so that no one has to stand,
but it does mean that the people at the back of the room may be a bit squashed.
We'll only be here for about half an hour so, hopefully, that's OK.
One of the first questions we're often asked is how old you need to be to volunteer.
Well, you can be as young as 16 or you can be 60 or over:
it all depends on what type of voluntary work you want to do.
Other considerations, such as reliability, are crucial in voluntary work
and age isn't related to these, in our experience.
Another question we get asked relates to training.
Well, there's plenty of that and it's all face-to-face.
What's more, training doesn't end when you start working for us.
It takes place before, during and after periods of work.
Often, it's run by other experienced volunteers as managers tend to prefer to get on with other things.
Now, I would ask you to consider a couple of important issues
before you decide to apply for voluntary work.
We don't worry about why you want to be a volunteer -
people have many different reasons that range from getting work experience to just doing something they've always wanted to do.
But it is critical that you have enough hours in the day for whatever role we agree is suitable for you -
if being a volunteer becomes stressful then it's best not to do it at all.
You may think that your income is important, but we don't ask about that.
It's up to you to decide if you can work without earning money.
What we value is dedication.
Some of our most loyal volunteers earn very little themselves
but still give their full energy to the work they do with us.
OK, so let's take a look at some of the work areas that we need volunteers for
and the sort of things that would help you in those.
You may wish simply to help us raise money.
If you have the creativity to come up with an imaginative or novel way of fundraising, we'd be delighted,
as standing in the local streets or shops with a collection box can be rather boring!
One outdoor activity that we need volunteers for is litter collection
and for this, it's useful if you can walk for long periods, sometimes uphill.
Some of our regular collectors are quite elderly,
but very active and keen to protect the environment.
If you enjoy working with children, we have three vacancies for what are called 'playmates'.
These volunteers help children learn about staying healthy through a range of out-of-school activities.
You don't need to have children yourself,
but it's good if you know something about nutrition and can give clear instructions.
If that doesn't appeal to you,
maybe you would be interested in helping out at our story club for disabled children,
especially if you have done some acting.
We put on three performances a year based on books they have read
and we're always looking for support with the theatrical side of this.
The last area I'll mention today is first aid.
Volunteers who join this group can end up teaching others in vulnerable groups who may be at risk of injury.
Initially, though, your priority will be to take in a lot of information
and not forget any important steps or details.
Right, so does anyone have any questions...

1008,Cam18 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam18---test-1---part-3,77,"Hi Chantal. What did you think of the talk, then?
Hi Hugo.
I thought it was good once I'd moved seats.
Oh, were the people beside you chatting or something?
It wasn't that.
I went early so that I'd get a seat and not have to stand,
but then this guy sat right in front of me and he was so tall!
It's hard to see through people's heads, isn't it?
Impossible!
Anyway, to answer your question,
I thought it was really interesting,
especially what the speaker said about the job market.
Me too.
I mean we know we're going into a really competitive field so it's obvious that we may struggle to get work.
That's right,
and we know we can't all have that 'dream job'.
Yeah, but it looks like there's a whole range of... areas of work that we hadn't even thought of,
like fashion journalism, for instance.
Yeah, I wasn't expecting so many career options.
Overall, she had quite a strong message, didn't she?
She did.
She kept saying things like 'I know you all think this, but...'
and then she'd tell us how it really is.
Perhaps she thinks students are a bit narrow-minded about the industry.
It was a bit harsh, though!
We know it's a tough industry.
Yeah, and we're only first-years, after all.
We've got a lot to learn.
Exactly.
Do you think our secondary school education should have been more career-focused?
Well, we had numerous talks on careers, which was good,
but none of them were very inspiring.
They could've asked more people like today's speaker to talk to us.
I agree.
We were told about lots of different careers, just when we needed to be,
but not by the experts who really know stuff.
So did today's talk influence your thoughts on what career you'd like to take up in the future?
Well. I promised myself that I'd go through this course and keep an open mind till the end.
But I think it's better to pick an area of the industry now and then aim to get better and better at it.
Well, I think we'll just have to differ on that issue!
One thing's for certain, though.
From what she said, we'll be unpaid assistants in the industry for quite a long time.
I'm prepared for that, aren't you?
Actually, I'm not going to accept that view.
Really?
But she knows it's the case,
and everyone else says the same.
That doesn't mean it has to be true for me.
OK.
Well, I hope you're right!
I thought the speaker's account of her first job was fascinating.
Yeah, she admitted she was lucky to get work being a personal dresser for a musician.
She didn't even apply for the job
and there she was getting paid to choose all his clothes.
It must have felt amazing,
though she said all she was looking for back then was experience, not financial reward.
And then he was so mean, telling her she was more interested in her own appearance than his!
But she did realise he was right about that,
which really made me think.
I'm always considering my own clothes
but now I can see you should be focusing on your client!
She obviously regretted losing the job.
Well, as she said, she should have hidden her negative feelings about him, but she didn't.
It was really brave the way she picked herself up and took that job in retail.
Fancy working in a shop after that!
Yeah, well, she recommended we all do it at some point.
I guess as a designer you'd get to find out some useful information,
like how big or small the average shopper is.
I think that's an issue for manufacturers, not designers.
However, it would be useful to know if there's a gap in the market, you know,
an item that no one's stocking but that consumers are looking for.
Yeah, people don't give up searching.
They also take things back to the store if they aren't right.
Yeah.
Imagine you worked in an expensive shop
and you found out the garments sold there were being returned because they... fell apart in the wash!
Yeah, it would be good to know that kind of thing.

1009,Cam18 - Test 1 - Part 4,B2,cam18---test-1---part-4,74,"For my presentation today
I want to tell you about how groups of elephants have been moved and settled in new reserves.
This is known as translocation and has been carried out in Malawi in Africa in recent years.
The reason this is being done is because of overpopulation of elephants in some areas.
Overpopulation is a good problem to have
and not one we tend to hear about very often.
In Malawi's Majete National Park
the elephant population had been wiped out by poachers,
who killed the elephants for their ivory.
But in 2003,
the park was restocked and effective law enforcement was introduced.
Since then, not a single elephant has been poached.
In this safe environment, the elephant population boomed.
Breeding went so well that there were more elephants than the park could support.
This led to a number of problems.
Firstly, there was more competition for food,
which meant that some elephants were suffering from hunger.
As there was a limit to the amount of food in the national park,
some elephants began looking further afield.
Elephants were routinely knocking down fences around the park,
which then had to be repaired at a significant cost.
To solve this problem,
the decision was made to move dozens of elephants from Majete National Park to Nkhotakota Wildlife Park,
where there were no elephants.
But, obviously, attempting to move significant numbers of elephants to a new home 300 kilometres away is quite a challenge.
So how did this translocation process work in practice?
Elephants were moved in groups of between eight and twenty,
all belonging to one family.
Because relationships are very important to elephants,
they all had to be moved at the same time.
A team of vets and park rangers flew over the park in helicopters and targeted a group,
which were rounded up and directed to a designated open plain.
The vets then used darts to immobilise the elephants.
This was a tricky manoeuvre,
as they not only had to select the right dose of tranquiliser for different-sized elephants
but they had to dart the elephants as they were running around.
This also had to be done as quickly as possible
so as to minimise the stress caused.
As soon as the elephants began to flop onto the ground,
the team moved in to take care of them.
To avoid the risk of suffocation,
the team had to make sure none of the elephants were lying on their chests
because their lungs could be crushed in this position.
So all the elephants had to be placed on their sides.
One person stayed with each elephant
while they waited for the vets to do checks.
It was very important to keep an eye on their breathing.
If there were fewer than six breaths per minute,
the elephant would need urgent medical attention.
Collars were fitted to the matriarch in each group
so their movements could be tracked in their new home.
Measurements were taken of each elephant's tusks.
Elephants with large tusks would be at greater risk from poachers
and also of their feet.
The elephants were then taken to a recovery area
before being loaded onto trucks and transported to their new home.
The elephants translocated to Nkhotakota settled in very well
and the project has generally been accepted to have been a huge success
and not just for the elephants.
Employment prospects have improved enormously,
contributing to rising living standards for the whole community.
Poaching is no longer an issue,
as former poachers are able to find more reliable sources of income.
In fact, many of them volunteered to give up their weapons,
as they were no longer of any use to them.
More than two dozen elephants have been born at Nkhotakota since relocation.
With an area of more than 1,800 square kilometres,
there's plenty of space for the elephant population to continue to grow.
Their presence is also helping to rebalance Nkhotakota's damaged ecosystem
and providing a sustainable conservation model, which could be replicated in other parks.
All this has been a big draw for tourism,
which contributes five times more than the illegal wildlife trade to GDP,
and this is mainly because of the elephants.
There's also been a dramatic rise...

1010,Cam18 - Test 2 - Part 1,B1,cam18---test-2---part-1,88,"So, I understand you're interested in restaurant work?
Yes. I've got a bit of experience and I can provide references.
That's good. I can check all that later.
Now, Milo's Restaurants have some vacancies at the moment.
They're a really good company to work for.
Lots of benefits.
Oh right.
Yes. They've got a very good reputation for looking after staff.
For example, all employees get training, even temporary staff.
Oh really? That's quite unusual, isn't it?
Certainly is.
And do staff get free uniforms too?
Um... you just need to wear a white T-shirt and black trousers, it says here.
So I guess not...
But another benefit of working for a big company like this
is that you can get a discount at any of their restaurants.
Even at weekends?
No, but you'll be working then anyway.
Oh yes. I suppose so.
Um... most of their restaurants are in the city centre, aren't they?
So, easy to get to by bus?
Yes. That's right.
But if you have to do a late shift and finish work after midnight,
the company will pay for you to get a taxi home.
I probably won't need one. I think I'd use my bike.
OK.
Now, they do have some quite specific requirements for the kind of person they're looking for.
Milo's is a young, dynamic company
and they're really keen on creating a strong team.
It's really important that you can fit in and get on well with everyone.
Yeah. I've got no problem with that.
It sounds good, actually.
The last place I worked for was quite demanding too.
We had to make sure we gave a really high level of service.
That's good to hear because that will be equally important at Milo's.
I know they want people who have an eye for detail.
That's fine. I'm very used to working in that kind of environment.
Perfect.
So the only other thing that's required is good communication skills,
so you'll need to have a certificate in English.
Sure.
OK. Let's have a look at the current job vacancies at Milo's.
The first one is in Wivenhoe Street.
Sorry, where?
Wivenhoe.
W-I-V-E-N-H-O-E.
It's quite central, just off Cork Street.
Oh right.
They're looking for a breakfast supervisor.
That would be OK.
So you're probably familiar with the kind of responsibilities involved.
Obviously checking that all the portions are correct, etc.,
and then things like checking all the procedures for cleaning the equipment are being followed.
OK.
And what about the salary?
In my last job I was getting ¬£9.50 per hour.
I was hoping to get a bit more than that.
Well, to begin with, you'd be getting ¬£9.75
but that goes up to ¬£11.25 after three months.
That's not too bad.
And I suppose it's a very early start?
That's the only unattractive thing about this job.
But then you have the afternoons and evenings free.
So the restaurant starts serving breakfast from 7 a.m.
And you'd have to be there at 5.30 to set everything up.
But you'd be finished at 12.30.
Well, as you say, there are advantages to that.
Now, you might also be interested in the job at the City Road branch.
That's for a junior chef, so again a position of responsibility.
I might prefer that, actually.
Right, well obviously this role would involve supporting the sous chef and other senior staff.
And you'd be responsible for making sure there's enough stock each week
and sorting out all the deliveries.
I've never done that before,
but I imagine it's fairly straightforward, once you get the hang of it.
Yes, and you'd be working alongside more experienced staff to begin with,
so I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem.
The salary's slightly higher here.
It's an annual salary of ¬£23,000.
Right.
I know that if they like you, it's likely you'll be promoted quite quickly.
So that's worth thinking about.
Yes. It does sound interesting.
What are the hours like?
The usual, I think.
There's a lot of evening and weekend work, but they're closed on Mondays.
But you do get one Sunday off every four weeks.
So would you like me to send off your...

1011,Cam18 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam18---test-2---part-2,58,"Hello everyone.
It's good to see that so many members of the public have shown up for our presentation
on the new housing development planned on the outskirts of Nunston.
I'm Mark Reynolds and I'm Communications Manager at the development.
I'll start by giving you a brief overview of our plans for the development.
So one thing I'm sure you'll want to know is why we've selected this particular site for a housing development.
At present it's being used for farming,
like much of the land around Nunston.
But because of the new industrial centre in Nunston,
there's a lot of demand for housing for employees in the region,
as many employees are having to commute long distances at present.
Of course, there's also the fact that we have an international airport just 20 minutes' drive away,
but although that's certainly convenient,
it wasn't one of our major criteria for choosing the site.
We were more interested in the fact that there's an excellent hospital just 15 kilometres away,
and a large secondary school even closer than that.
One drawback to the site is that it's on quite a steep slope,
but we've taken account of that in our planning
so it shouldn't be a major problem.
We've had a lot of positive feedback about the plans.
People like the wide variety of accommodation types and prices,
and the fact that it's only a short drive to get out into the countryside from the development.
We were particularly pleased that so many people liked the designs for the layout of the development,
with the majority of people saying it generally made a good impression
and blended in well with the natural features of the landscape,
with provision made for protecting trees and wildlife on the site.
Some people have mentioned that they'd like to see more facilities for cyclists,
and we'll look at that,
but the overall feedback has been that the design and facilities of the development
make it seem a place where people of all ages can live together happily.
OK. So I'll put a map of the proposed development up on the screen.
You'll see it's bounded on the south side by the main road,
which then goes on to Nunston.
Another boundary is formed by London Road, on the western side of the development.
Inside the development, there'll be about 400 houses and 3 apartment blocks.
There'll also be a school for children up to 11 years old.
If you look at the South Entrance at the bottom of the map,
there's a road from there that goes right up through the development.
The school will be on that road, at the corner of the second turning to the left.
A large sports centre is planned with facilities for indoor and outdoor activities.
This will be on the western side of the development,
just below the road that branches off from London Road.
There'll be a clinic where residents can go if they have any health problems.
Can you see the lake towards the top of the map?
The clinic will be just below this, to the right of a street of houses.
There'll also be a community centre for people of all ages.
On the northeast side of the development,
there'll be a row of specially designed houses specifically for residents over 65.
And the community centre will be adjoining this.
We haven't forgotten about shopping.
There'll be a supermarket between the two entrances to the development.
We're planning to leave the three large trees near London Road,
and it'll be just to the south of these.
It's planned to have a playground for younger children.
If you look at the road that goes up from the South Entrance,
you'll see it curves round to the left at the top,
and the playground will be in that curve, with nice views of the lake.
OK, so now...

1012,Cam18 - Test 2 - Part 3,C1,cam18---test-2---part-3,82,"So, Michelle, shall we make a start on our presentation?
We haven't got that much time left.
No, Adam.
But at least we've done all the background reading.
I found it really interesting.
I'd never even heard of the Laki eruption before this.
Me neither.
I suppose 1783 is a long time ago.
But it was a huge eruption
and it had such devastating consequences.
I know.
It was great there were so many primary sources to look at.
It really gives you a sense of how catastrophic the volcano was.
People were really trying to make sense of the science for the first time.
That's right.
But what I found more significant was how it impacted directly and indirectly on political events,
as well as having massive social and economic consequences.
I know.
That should be the main focus of our presentation.
The observations made by people at the time were interesting, weren't they?
I mean, they all gave a pretty consistent account of what happened,
even if they didn't always use the same terminology.
Yeah.
I was surprised there were so many weather stations established by that time,
so, you know, you can see how the weather changed, often by the hour.
Right.
Writers at the time talked about the Laki haze to describe the volcanic fog that spread across Europe.
They all realised that this wasn't the sort of fog they were used to,
and of course this was in pre-industrial times,
so they hadn't experienced sulphur-smelling fog before.
No, that's true.
Reports from the period blamed the haze for an increase in headaches,
respiratory issues and asthma attacks.
And they all describe how it covered the sun and made it look a strange red colour.
Must have been very weird.
It's interesting that Benjamin Franklin wrote about the haze.
Did you read that?
He was the American ambassador in Paris at the time.
Yeah.
At first no one realised that the haze was caused by the volcanic eruption in Iceland.
It was Benjamin Franklin who realised that before anyone else.
He's often credited with that, apparently.
But a French naturalist beat him to it. I can't remember his name.
I'd have to look it up.
Then other naturalists had the same idea,
all independently of each other.
Oh right.
We should talk about the immediate impact of the eruption, which was obviously enormous,
especially in Iceland, where so many people died.
You'd expect that.
And the fact that the volcanic ash drifted so swiftly
but not that the effects would go on for so long.
Or that two years after the eruption,
strange weather events were being reported as far away as North America and North Africa.
No.
I found all that hard to believe too.
It must have been terrible
and there was nothing anyone could do about it,
even if they knew the ash cloud was coming in their direction.
We should run through some of the terrible consequences of the eruption experienced in different countries.
There's quite a varied range.
Starting with Iceland, where the impact on farming was devastating.
One of the most dramatic things there was the effect on livestock as they grazed in the fields.
They were poisoned because they ate vegetation that had been contaminated with fluorine
as a result of the volcanic fallout.
That was horrible.
In Egypt, the bizarre weather patterns led to a severe drought
and as a result the Nile didn't flood,
which meant the crops all failed.
It's so far from where the eruption happened
and yet the famine there led to more people dying than any other country.
It was worse than the plague.
OK.
Then in the UK the mortality rate went up a lot, presumably from respiratory illnesses.
According to one report it was about double the usual number
and included an unusually high percentage of people under the age of 25.
I think people will be surprised to hear that the weather in the USA was badly affected too.
George Washington even makes a note in his diary that they were snowbound until March in Virginia.
That was before he became president.
Yes, and there was ice floating down the Mississippi, which was unprecedented.
Astonishing, really.
Anyway, what do you think...

1013,Cam18 - Test 2 - Part 4,C1,cam18---test-2---part-4,57,"Good morning.
Now, we've been asked to choose an aspect of European clothing or fashion
and to talk about its development over time.
I decided to focus on a rather small area of clothing and that's pockets.
I chose pockets for two reasons, really.
We all have them - in jeans, jackets, coats, for example -
and even though we often carry bags or briefcases as well,
nothing is quite as convenient as being able to pop your phone or credit card into your pocket.
Yet, I suspect that, other than that, people don't really think about pockets too much
and they're rather overlooked as a fashion item.
It's certainly very interesting to go back in time
and see how pockets developed for men and women.
In the 18th century,
fashions were quite different from the way they are now,
and pockets were too.
If we think about male fashion first...
that was the time when suits became popular.
Trousers were knee-length only and referred to as 'breeches',
the waistcoats were short and the jackets were long,
but all three garments were lined with material
and pockets were sewn into this cloth by whichever tailor the customer used.
The wearer could then carry small objects such as pencils or coins on their person
and reach them through a gap in the lining.
Coat pockets became increasingly decorative on the outside for men who wanted to look stylish,
but they were often larger but plainer
if the wearer was someone with a profession who needed to carry medical instruments -
a doctor or physician, for example.
The development of women's pockets was a little different.
For one thing, they weren't nearly as visible or as easy to reach as men's.
In the 18th and 19th centuries,
women carried numerous possessions on their person
and some of these could be worth a lot of money.
Women were more vulnerable to theft and wealthy women, in particular, worried constantly about pickpockets.
So, what they did was to have a pair of pockets made that were tied together with string.
The pockets were made of fabric,
which might be recycled cloth if the wearer had little money
or something more expensive, such as linen,
sometimes featuring very delicate embroidery.
Women tied the pockets around their waist so that they hung beneath their clothes.
Remember, skirts were long then
and there was plenty of room to hide a whole range of small possessions between the layers of petticoats that were commonly worn.
They would have an opening in the folds of their skirts,
through which they could reach whatever they needed, like their perfume.
Working women, of course, also needed to carry around items that they might use for whatever job or trade they were involved in,
but their pairs of pockets still remained on the inside of their clothing,
they just got bigger or longer,
sometimes reaching down to their knees!
So, the tie on pockets went well into the 19th century
and only changed when fashion altered towards the end of that period.
That's when dresses became tighter and less bulky,
and the pairs of pockets became very noticeable.
They stood out too much and detracted from the woman's image.
Women who had been used to carrying around a range of personal possessions - and still wanted to -
needed somewhere to carry these items about their person.
That was when small bags, or pouches as they were known, came into fashion
and, of course, they inevitably led on to the handbag of more modern times,
particularly when fashion removed pockets altogether.

1014,Cam18 - Test 3 - Part 1,B1,cam18---test-3---part-1,87,"Hello, Wayside Camera Club, Breda speaking.
Oh, hello, um, my name's Dan and I'd like to join your club.
That's great, Dan.
We have an application form,
would you like to complete it over the phone,
then you can ask any questions you might have?
Oh, yes, thanks.
OK, so what's your family name?
It's Green, Dan Green.
So, can I take your email address?
Yes, it's dan1068@market.com.
Thanks.
And what about your home address?
Well, I'm about ten miles away from your club in Peacetown.
I live in a house there.
OK, so what's the house number and street?
It's 52 Marrowfield Street.
Is that M-A-R-R-O-W-F-I-E-L-D?
That's right.
...and that's Peacetown, you said?
So how did you hear about our club?
Did you look on the internet?
I usually do that, but this time...
well, I was talking to a relative the other day and he suggested it.
Oh, is he a member too?
He belongs to another club,
but he'd heard good things about yours.
OK.
So what do you hope to get from joining?
Well, one thing that really interests me is the competitions that you have.
I enjoy entering those.
Right.
Anything else?
Well, I also like to socialise with other photographers.
That's great.
So what type of membership would you like?
What are the options?
It's ¬£30 a year for full membership
or ¬£20 a year if you're an associate.
I think I'll go for the full membership, then.
That's a good idea
because you can't vote in meetings with an associate membership.
If I could just find out a bit more about you...
OK.
So you said you wanted to compete,
have you ever won any photography competitions?
Not yet, but I have entered three in the past.
Oh, that's interesting.
So why don't you tell me something about those?
Let's start with the first one.
Well, the theme was entitled 'Domestic Life'.
I see.
So it had to be something related to the home?
Yeah.
I chose to take a photo of a family sitting round the dinner table having a meal,
and, urn, I didn't win, but I did get some feedback.
Oh, what did the judges say?
That it was too 'busy' as a picture.
Aha, so it was the composition of the picture that they criticised?
That's right, and once they'd told me that, I could see my mistake.
So what was the theme of the second composition?
Well, my university was on the coast
and that area gets a lot of beautiful sunsets
so that was the theme.
Oh, sunsets, that's a great theme.
Yes.
The instructions were to capture the clouds as well,
it couldn't just be blue sky and a setting sun.
Sure, 'cause they give you all those amazing pinks and purples.
Yeah, and I thought I'd done that well,
but the feedback was that I should have waited a bit longer to get the shot.
I see.
So the timing wasn't right.
Yes, I took it too soon, basically.
And then the third competition I entered was called 'Animal Magic'.
Well, that's a difficult subject!
I know!
I had to take hundreds of shots.
I'm sure, because animals move all the time.
That's what we had to show,
there had to be some movements in the scene.
I got a great shot of a fox in the end,
but I took it at night and...
well, I suspected that it was a bit dark which is what I was told.
Well, Dan, you seem to be really keen and we'd be delighted to have you in our club.
I'm sure we can help with all those areas that you've outlined.
Thanks, that's great.

1015,Cam18 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam18---test-3---part-2,66,"This evening we're delighted to welcome Dan Beagle,
who's just written a book on looking for and finding food in the wild.
He's going to tell us everything we need to know about picking wild mushrooms.
Thank you very much.
Well, I need to start by talking about safety.
You really need to know what you're doing because some mushrooms are extremely poisonous.
Having said that, once you know what to look for,
it's really worth doing for the amazing variety of mushrooms available -
which you can't get in the shops.
But of course, you have to be very careful
and that's why I always say you should never consume mushrooms picked by friends or neighbours.
Always remember that some poisonous mushrooms look very similar to edible ones
and it's easy for people to get confused.
The other thing to avoid is mushrooms growing beside busy roads for obvious reasons.
But nothing beats the taste of freshly picked mushrooms.
Don't forget that the ones in the shops are often several days old and past their best.
There are certain ideas about wild mushrooms that it's important to be aware of.
Don't listen to people who tell you that it's only OK to eat mushrooms that are pale or dull.
This is completely untrue.
Some edible mushrooms are bright red, for example.
Personally, I prefer mushrooms cooked
but it won't do you any harm to eat them uncooked in salads,
it's not necessary to peel them.
Another thing you should remember is that you can't tell if a mushroom is safe to eat by its smell.
Some of the most deadly mushrooms have no smell and taste quite nice, apparently.
Finally, just because deer or squirrels eat a particular mushroom doesn't mean that you can.
Of course, mushroom picking is associated with the countryside
but if you haven't got a car, your local park can be a great place to start.
There are usually a range of habitats where mushrooms grow,
such as playing fields and wooded areas.
But you need to be there first thing in the morning,
as there's likely to be a lot of competition,
not just from people but wildlife too.
The deer often get the best mushrooms in my local park.
If you're a complete beginner,
I wouldn't recommend going alone or relying on photos in a book,
even the one I've written!
There are some really good phone apps for identifying mushrooms,
but you can't always rely on getting a good signal in the middle of a wood.
If possible, you should go with a group led by an expert.
You'll stay safe and learn a lot that way.
Conservation is a really important consideration
and you must follow a few basic rules.
You should never pick all the mushrooms in one area.
Collect only enough for your own needs.
Be very careful that you don't trample on young mushrooms or other plants.
And make sure you don't pick any mushrooms that are endangered and protected by law.
There's been a decline in some varieties of wild mushrooms in this part of the country.
Restaurants are becoming more interested in locally sourced food like wild mushrooms,
but the biggest problem is that so many new houses have been built in this area in the last ten years.
And more water is being taken from rivers and reservoirs because of this,
and mushroom habitats have been destroyed.
Anyway, a word of advice on storing mushrooms.
Collect them in a brown paper bag
and as soon as you get home, put them in the fridge.
They'll be fine for a couple of days,
but it's best to cook them as soon as possible
after washing them really carefully first, of course.
So everybody knows what a mushroom tastes like, right?
Well, you'll be surprised by the huge variety of wild mushrooms there are.
Be adventurous!
They're great in so many dishes:
stir fries, risottos, pasta.
But just be aware that some people can react badly to certain varieties
so it's a good idea not to eat huge quantities to begin with.
OK, so now I'm going to show you...

1016,Cam18 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam18---test-3---part-3,67,"That seminar yesterday on automation and the future of work was really good, wasn't it?
Looking at the first industrial revolution in Britain in the 19th century
and seeing how people reacted to massive change was a real eye opener.
Yes.
It was interesting to hear how people felt about automation then
and what challenges they faced.
I didn't know that first started with workers in the textile industry.
With those protesting workers called the Luddites
destroying their knitting machines because they were so worried about losing their jobs.
Yes, and ultimately, they didn't achieve anything.
And anyway, industrialisation created more jobs than it destroyed.
Yes, that's true,
but it probably didn't seem a positive thing at the time.
I can see why the Luddites felt so threatened.
I know.
I'm sure I would have felt the same.
The discussion about the future of work was really optimistic for a change.
I like the idea that work won't involve doing boring, repetitive tasks,
as robots will do all that.
Normally, you only hear negative stuff about the future.
Bit too optimistic, don't you think?
For example, I can't see how people are about to have more leisure time,
when all the evidence shows people are spending longer than ever at work.
No, that's true.
And what about lower unemployment?
I'm not so sure about that.
Perhaps in the long term,
but not in the foreseeable future.
And I expect most people will be expected to work until they're much older
as everyone's living much longer.
That's already happening.
I enjoyed all that stuff on how technology's changed some jobs
and how they're likely to change in the near future.
Yeah, incredible.
Like accountants.
You might think all the technological innovations would have put them out of a job,
but in fact there are more of them than ever.
They're still really in demand and have become far more efficient.
Right. That was amazing.
Twenty times more accountants in this country compared to the 19th century.
I know.
I'd never have thought that demand for hairdressing would have gone up so much in the last hundred years.
One hairdresser for every 287 people now,
compared to one for over 1,500.
Yeah because people's earning power has gone up so they can afford to spend more on personal services like that.
But technology hasn't changed the actual job that much.
No, they've got hairdryers, etc.
but it's one job where you don't depend on a computer...
The kind of work that administrative staff do has changed enormously, thanks to technology.
Even 20 years ago there were secretaries doing dictation and typing.
Yes. Really boring compared to these days,
when they're given much more responsibility and higher status.
A lot of graduates go in for this kind of work now...
I'd expected there to be a much bigger change in the number of agricultural workers in the 19th century.
But the 1871 census showed that roughly 25% of the population worked on the land.
Yeah, I'd have assumed it would be more than 50%.
Now it's less than 0.2%.
Hmm... What about care workers?
They barely existed in the 19th century
as people's lifespan was so much shorter.
But now of course this sector will see huge growth.
Yeah, and it's hard enough to meet current demand.
The future looks quite bleak for bank clerks.
They've been in decline since ATMs were introduced in the 80s.
And technology will certainly make most of the jobs they do now redundant, I think.
I agree, although the situation may change.
It's very hard to predict what will happen.

1017,Cam18 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam18---test-3---part-4,65,"In today's astronomy lecture,
I'm going to talk about the need for a system to manage the movement of satellites
and other objects in orbit around the Earth.
In other words, a Space Traffic Management system.
We already have effective Air Traffic Control systems
that are used internationally to ensure that planes navigate our skies safely.
Well, Space Traffic Management is a similar concept,
but focusing on the control of satellites.
The aim of such a system would be to prevent the danger of collisions in space
between the objects in orbit around the Earth.
In order to do this, we'd need to have a set of legal measures,
and we'd also have to develop the technical systems to enable us to prevent such accidents.
But unfortunately, at present we don't actually have a Space Traffic Management system that works.
So why not?
What are the problems in developing such a system?
Well, for one thing, satellites are relatively cheap these days,
compared with how they were in the past,
meaning that more people can afford to put them into space.
So there's a lot more of them out there,
and people aren't just launching single satellites
but whole constellations, consisting of thousands of them designed to work together.
So space is getting more crowded every day.
But in spite of this, one thing you may be surprised to learn
is that you can launch a satellite into space
and, once it's out there, it doesn't have to send back any information to Earth to allow its identification.
So while we have international systems for ensuring we know where the planes in our skies are,
and to prevent them from colliding with one another,
when it comes to the safety of satellites,
at present we don't have anything like enough proper ways of tracking them.
And it isn't just entire satellites that we need to consider.
A greater threat is the huge amount of space debris in orbit around the Earth -
broken bits of satellite and junk from space stations and so on.
And some of these are so small that they can be very hard to identify,
but they can still be very dangerous.
In addition, some operators may be unwilling to share information about the satellites they've launched.
For example, a satellite may be designed for military purposes,
or it may have been launched for commercial reasons,
and the operators don't want competitors to have information about it.
And even if the operators are willing to provide it,
the information isn't easy to collect.
Details are needed about the object itself,
as well as about its location at a particular time -
and remember that a satellite isn't very big,
and it's likely to be moving at thousands of kilometres an hour.
We don't have any sensors that can constantly follow something moving so fast,
so all that the scientists can do is to put forward a prediction concerning where the satellite is heading next.
So those are some of the problems that we're facing.
Let's consider now some of the solutions that have been suggested.
One key issue is the way in which information is dealt with.
We need more information,
but it also needs to be accessible at a global level,
so we need to establish shared standards that we can all agree on
for the way in which this information is presented.
We already do this in other areas of science,
so although this is a challenge, it's not an impossible task.
Then, as all this information's collected,
it needs to be put together so it can be used,
and that will involve creating a single database on which it can be entered.
As we continue to push forward new developments,
congestion of the space environment is only going to increase.
To cope with this, we need to develop a system like the one I've described
to coordinate the work of the numerous spacecraft operators,
but it's also essential that this system is one that establishes trust in the people that use it,
both nationally and at a global level.
One interesting development...

Oh, hello. Is that Julie Davison?
Yes.
This is Greg Preston from the Employment Agency.
We met last week when you came in to enquire about office work.
Oh, that's right.
Now we've just had some details come in of a job which might interest you.
OK.
So this is a position for a receptionist,
I believe you've done that sort of work before?
Yes, I have,
I worked in a sports centre for a couple of years before I got married and had the children.
Right.
Well, this job's in Fordham, so not too far away for you,
and it's at the medical centre there.
OK.
So where exactly is that?
It's quite near the station, on Chastons Road.
Sorry?
Chastons Road,
that's C-H-A-S-T-O-N-S.
OK, thanks.
So what would the work involve?
Dealing with enquiries from patients?
Yes,
and you'd also be involved in making appointments,
whether face to face or on the phone.
And rescheduling them if necessary.
Fine, that shouldn't be a problem.
And another of your duties would be keeping the centre's database up-to-date.
Then you might have other general administrative duties as well,
but those would be the main ones.
OK.
Now when the details came in, I immediately thought of you
because one thing they do require is someone with experience,
and you did mention your work at the sports centre when you came in to see us.
Yes, in fact I enjoyed that job.
Is there anything else they're looking for?
Well, they say it's quite a high-pressure environment,
they're always very busy,
and patients are often under stress,
so they want someone who can cope with that and stay calm,
and at the same time be confident when interacting with the public.
Well, after dealing with three children all under five,
I reckon I can cope with that.
I'm sure you can.
And then another thing they mention is that they're looking for someone with good IT skills...
Not a problem.
So you'd be interested in following this up?
Sure.
When would it start?
Well, they're looking for someone from the beginning of next month,
but I should tell you that this isn't a permanent job,
it's temporary, so the contract would be just to the end of September.
But they do say that there could be further opportunities after that.
OK.
And what would the hours be?
Well, they want someone who can start at 7:45 in the morning.
Could you manage that?
Yes, my husband would have to get the kids up and off to my mother's,
she's going to be looking after them while I'm at work.
What time would I finish?
1:15
That should work out all right.
I can pick the kids up on my way home,
and then I'll have the afternoon with them.
Oh, one thing...
is there parking available for staff at the centre?
Yes, there is.
and it's also on a bus route.
Right.
Well, I expect I'll have the car but it's good to know that.
OK, so where do I go from here?
Well, if you're happy for me to do so,
I'll forward your CV and references,
and then the best thing would probably be for you to phone them
so they can arrange for an interview.
Great. Well thank you very much.
You're welcome. Bye now.

1019,Cam18 - Test 4 - Part 2,B1,cam18---test-4---part-2,69,"Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Museum of Farming Life.
I understand it's your first visit here,
so I'd like to give you some background information about the museum
and then explain a little about what you can see during your visit.
So, where we're standing at the moment is the entrance to a large building
that was constructed in 1880
as the home of a local businessman, Alfred Palmer, of the Palmer biscuit factory.
It was later sold and became a hall of residence for students in 1911,
and a museum in 1951.
In 2005, a modern extension was built to accommodate the museum's collections.
The museum's owned by the university,
and apart from two rooms that are our offices,
the university uses the main part of the building.
You may see students going into the building for lessons,
but it's not open to museum visitors, I'm afraid.
It's a shame because the interior architectural features are outstanding,
especially the room that used to be the library.
Luckily, we've managed to keep entry to the museum free.
This includes access to all the galleries, outdoor areas and the rooms for special exhibitions.
We run activities for children and students,
such as the museum club, for which there's no charge.
We do have a donation box just over there
so feel free to give whatever amount you consider appropriate.
We do have a cloakroom,
if you'd like to leave your coats and bags somewhere.
Unlike other museums, photography is allowed here,
so you might like to keep your cameras with you.
You might be more comfortable not carrying around heavy rucksacks,
though keep your coats and jackets on as it's quite cold in the museum garden today.
I'd like to tell you about the different areas of the museum.
Just inside, and outside the main gallery,
we have an area called Four Seasons.
Here you can watch a four-minute animation of a woodland scene.
It was designed especially for the museum
by a group of young people on a film studies course, and it's beautiful.
Children absolutely love it, but then, so do adults.
The main gallery's called Town and Country.
It includes a photographic collection of prize-winning sheep and shepherds.
Leaving Town and Country, you enter Farmhouse Kitchen,
which is... well, self-explanatory.
Here we have the oldest collection of equipment for making butter and cheese in the country.
And this morning, a specialist cheesemaker will be giving demonstrations of how it's produced.
You may even get to try some.
After that, you can go in two directions.
To the right is a staircase
that takes you up to a landing from where you can look down on the galleries.
To the left is a room called A Year on the Farm.
There's lots of seating here as sometimes we use the room for school visits,
so it's a good place to stop for a rest.
If you're feeling competitive,
you can take our memory test in which you answer questions about things you've seen in the museum.
The next area's called Wagon Walk.
This contains farm carts from nearly every part of the country.
It's surprising how much regional variation there was.
Beside the carts are display boards with information about each one.
The carts are old and fragile,
so we ask you to keep your children close to you
and ensure they don't climb on the carts.
From Wagon Walk, you can either make your way back to reception
or go out into the garden
or even go back to take another look in the galleries.
In the far corner of the garden is Bees are Magic,
but we're redeveloping this area so you can't visit that at the moment.
You can still buy our honey in the shop, though.
Finally, there's The Pond,
which contains all kinds of interesting wildlife.
There are baby ducks that are only a few days old, as well as tiny frogs.
The Pond isn't deep and there's a fence around it,
so it's perfectly safe for children.

1020,Cam18 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam18---test-4---part-3,77,"So now I want you to discuss the lesson we've just been watching on the video
and think about the ways in which origami can be a useful educational tool.
Can you all work with the person sitting next to you...
I had no idea that such a simple thing like folding squares of paper to make the shape of something like a bird could be such an amazing tool.
It's made me see origami in a whole new light.
I know.
It was interesting to see the educational skills the children were developing by doing origami.
On the video you could see them really listening hard
to make sure they did all the steps in the right order to make the bird.
That's right.
In this lesson they were working individually
but it would also be interesting to see if the children could work out how to make something simple
without being given any direction.
That would help with building teamwork as well.
Yes, but much more of a challenge.
One thing that really stood out for me was that the children were all having fun while being taught something new.
Which is a key aim of any lesson with this age group.
And although these kids had no problems with folding the paper,
with younger children you could do origami to help practise fine motor skills.
Absolutely.
Shall we talk about the individual children we saw on the video?
I wrote all their names down and took some notes.
Yes, I did too.
OK, good.
Let's start with Sid.
He was interesting because before they started doing the origami, he was being quite disruptive.
Yes.
He really benefited from having to use his hands,
it helped him to settle down and start concentrating.
Yes, I noticed that too.
What about Jack?
I noticed he seemed to want to work things out for himself.
You could see him trying out different things rather than asking the teacher for help.
What did you make of Naomi?
She seemed to be losing interest at one point
but then she decided she wanted her mouse to be the best
and that motivated her to try harder.
She didn't seem satisfied with hers in the end, though.
No.
Anya was such a star.
She listened so carefully
and then produced the perfect bird with very little effort.
I think the teacher could have increased the level of difficulty for her.
Hmm... maybe.
I think it was the first time Zara had come across origami.
She looked as if she didn't really get what was going on.
She seemed unsure about what she was supposed to do.
but in the end hers didn't turn out too badly.
Yeah. I'm sure it was a positive learning experience for her.
I think one reason why the origami activity worked so well in this class
was that the teacher was well prepared.
Right.
I think it would have taken me ages to prepare examples,
showing each of the steps involved in making the bird.
But that was a really good idea.
The children could see what they were aiming for,
and much better for them to be able to hold something,
rather than just looking at pictures.
Those physical examples supported her verbal explanations really well.
It's strange that origami isn't used more widely.
Why do you think that is?
Well, teachers may just feel it's not that appealing to children who are used to doing everything on computers,
especially boys.
Even if they're aware of the benefits.
Oh, I don't know. It's no different to any other craft activity.
I bet it's because so many teachers are clumsy like me.
That's true,
too much effort required if you're not good with your hands.
Well, anyway, I think we should try it out in our maths teaching practice with Year 3.
I can see using origami is a really engaging way of reinforcing children's knowledge of geometric shapes,
like they were doing in the video,
but I think it would also work really well for presenting fractions, which is coming up soon.
Good idea, that's something most of the kids in that class might struggle with.
Origami would also be good practice for using symmetry,
but I think they did that last term.
OK, well let's try and get some ideas together and plan the lesson next week.
OK, if you could...

1021,Cam18 - Test 4 - Part 4,B2,cam18---test-4---part-4,74,"The person I've chosen to talk about is the French writer Victor Hugo -
many people have heard of him because his novel, Les Miserables,
which he wrote in 1862, is famous around the world.
It became a stage musical in the 1980s,
and a film version was also released in 2012.
So, some of us, I'm sure, have a pretty general idea of the plot,
but we know much less about the author.
Today, I'm going to provide a little more insight into this talented man
and I'm going to talk particularly about the home he had on the island of Guernsey in the British Channel Islands.
But first, his early career...
as I've said, he was a writer,
he was at the height of his career in Paris
and he was very highly regarded by his colleagues.
As far as literature was concerned,
he was the leading figure of the Romantic movement.
However, as well as being a literary genius,
he also gave many speeches about issues like the level of poverty in his society.
He felt very strongly about this
and about other areas where change was needed, like education.
This kind of outspoken criticism was not well liked by the rulers of France
and, eventually, the emperor - Napoleon III -
told Victor Hugo to leave Paris and not return;
in other words, he sent him into exile.
So Victor Hugo was forced to reside in other parts of Europe.
Guernsey was actually his third place of exile
and he landed there in 1855.
He produced a lot while on Guernsey - including Les Miserables -
and to do this, he had to spend a great deal of time in the home that he had there.
This was a property that he bought using the money he'd made in France
from the publication of a collection of his poetry.
It was the only property he ever owned, and he was very proud of it.
The property Victor Hugo bought on Guernsey was a large, five-storey house in the capital town of St Peter Port
and he lived there for 15 years,
returning to France in 1870 when Napoleon's Empire collapsed.
He decorated and furnished each level, or floor, of the house in unique and wonderful ways,
and many people consider the inside of the house to be a 'work of art'.
Today it's a museum that attracts 200,000 visitors a year.
He lived in the house with his family...
and portraits of its members still hang in rooms on the ground floor,
along with drawings that he did during his travels that he felt were important to him.
In other ground-floor rooms, there are huge tapestries
that he would've designed and loved.
The walls are covered in dark wood panelling that Victor Hugo created himself
using wooden furniture that he bought in the market.
The items were relatively inexpensive,
and he used them to create intricate carvings.
They gave an atmosphere on the lower level that was shadowy and rather solemn.
On the next level of the house there are two impressive lounges,
where he entertained his guests.
One lounge has entirely red furnishings,
such as sofas and wall coverings, and the other blue.
There's a strong Chinese influence in these areas
in things like the wallpaper pattern and the lamps -
which he would have made himself by copying original versions.
His library, where he left many of his favourite books,
forms the hallway to the third floor
and was a comfortable area where he could relax and enjoy his afternoons.
And then, at the very top of the house,
there's a room called the Lookout -
called that because it looks out over the harbour.
In contrast to the rather dark lower levels,
it's full of light and was like a glass office where he would write until lunchtime -
often at his desk.
So, Victor Hugo was a man of many talents,
but he was also true to his values.
While living in his house on Guernsey,
he entertained many other famous writers,
but he also invited a large group of local children from the deprived areas of the island to dinner once a week.
What's more, he served them their food,
which was an extraordinary gesture for the time period.
In 1927, the house was owned by his relatives,
and they decided to donate it to the city of Paris.
It has since been restored using photographs from the period
and, as I mentioned earlier, is now a museum that is open to the public.

1022,Cam17 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam17---test-1---part-1,78,"Hello?
Oh hello. My name's Jan.
Are you the right person to talk to about the Buckworth Conservation Group?
Yes, I'm Peter. I'm the secretary.
Good. I've just moved to this area, and I'm interested in getting involved.
I was in a similar group where I used to live.
Could you tell me something about your activities, please?
Of course.
Well, we have a mixture of regular activities and special events.
One of the regular ones is trying to keep the beach free of litter.
A few of us spend a couple of hours a month on it,
and it's awful how much there is to clear.
I wish people would be more responsible and take it home with them.
I totally agree.
I'd be happy to help with that.
Is it OK to take dogs?
I'm afraid not, as they're banned from the beach itself.
You can take them along the cliffs, though. And children are welcome.
Right.
We also manage a nature reserve, and there's a lot to do there all year round.
For example, because it's a popular place to visit,
we spend a lot of time looking after the paths
and making sure they're in good condition for walking.
I could certainly help with that.
Good.
And we have a programme of creating new habitats there.
We've just finished making and installing nesting boxes for birds to use,
and next we're going to work on encouraging insects,
they're important for the biodiversity of the reserve.
They certainly are.
Oh, and we're also running a project to identify the different species of butterflies that visit the reserve.
You might be interested in taking part in that.
Sure.
I was involved in something similar where I used to live,
counting all the species of moths.
I'd enjoy that.
Another job we're doing at the reserve is replacing the wall on the southern side,
between the parking area and our woodshed.
It was badly damaged in a storm last month.
OK.
Then as I said, we have a programme of events as well, both at the weekend, and during the week.
Right.
I presume you have guided walks?
I'd like to get to know the local countryside, as I'm new to the area.
Yes, we do. The next walk is to Ruston Island, a week on Saturday.
We'll be meeting in the car park at Dunsmore Beach at low tide,
that's when the sands are dry enough for us to walk to the island without getting wet.
Sounds good.
The island's a great place to explore.
It's quite small, and it's got a range of habitats.
It's also an ideal location for seeing seals just off the coast, or even on the beach.
OK.
And is there anything we should bring, like a picnic, for instance?
Yes, do bring one, as it's a full-day walk.
And of course it'll be wet walking across and back,
so make sure your boots are waterproof.
I must buy a new pair, there's a hole in one of my current ones!
Well, I'd definitely like to come on the walk.
Great.
Then later this month we're having a one-day woodwork session in Hopton Wood.
I've never tried that before.
Is it OK for beginners to take part?
Definitely.
There'll be a couple of experts leading the session,
and we keep the number of participants down, so you'll get as much help as you need.
Excellent!
I'd love to be able to make chairs.
That's probably too ambitious for one day!
You'll be starting with wooden spoons,
and of course learning how to use the tools.
And anything you make is yours to take home with you.
That sounds like fun.
When is it?
It's on the 17th, from 10 a.m. until 3.
There's a charge of ¬£35, including lunch
or ¬£40 if you want to camp in the wood.
I should think I'll come home the same day.
Well, I'd certainly like to join the group.

1023,Cam17 - Test 1 - Part 2,B1,cam17---test-1---part-2,63,"So, hello everyone.
My name's Lou Miller and I'm going to be your tour guide today
as we take this fantastic boat trip around the Tasmanian coast.
Before we set off, I just want to tell you a few things about our journey.
Our boats aren't huge as you can see.
We already have three staff members on board
and on top of that,
we can transport a further fifteen people, that's you - around the coastline.
But please note if there are more than nine people on either side of the boat,
we'll move some of you over, otherwise all eighteen of us will end up in the sea!
We've recently upgraded all our boats.
They used to be jet black,
but our new ones now have these comfortable dark red seats and a light-green exterior
in order to stand out from others and help promote our company.
This gives our boats a rather unique appearance, don't you think?
We offer you a free lunchbox during the trip
and we have three types.
Lunchbox 1 contains ham and tomato sandwiches.
Lunchbox 2 contains a cheddar cheese roll
and Lunchbox 3 is salad-based and also contains eggs and tuna.
All three lunchboxes also have a packet of crisps and chocolate bar inside.
Please let staff know which lunchbox you prefer.
I'm sure I don't have to ask you not to throw anything into the sea.
We don't have any bins to put litter in,
but Jess, myself or Ray, our other guide, will collect it from you after lunch
and put it all in a large plastic sack.
The engine on the boat makes quite a lot of noise so before we head off,
let me tell you a few things about what you're going to see.
This area is famous for its ancient lighthouse,
which you'll see from the boat as we turn past the first little island.
It was built in 1838 to protect sailors
as a number of shipwrecks had led to significant loss of life.
The construction itself was complicated
as some of the original drawings kept by the local council show.
It sits right on top of the cliffs in a very isolated spot.
In the nineteenth century there were many jobs there,
such as polishing the brass lamps,
chopping firewood and cleaning windows, that kept lighthouse keepers busy.
These workers were mainly prison convicts until the middle of that century
when ordinary families willing to live in such circumstances took over.
Some of you have asked me what creatures we can expect to see.
I know everyone loves the penguins,
but they're very shy and, unfortunately, tend to hide from passing boats,
but you might see birds in the distance, such as sea eagles,
flying around the cliff edges where they nest.
When we get to the rocky area inhabited by fur seals,
we'll stop and watch them swimming around the coast.
They're inquisitive creatures so don't be surprised if one pops up right in front of you.
Their predators, orca whales, hunt along the coastline too,
but spotting one of these is rare.
Dolphins, on the other hand,
can sometimes approach on their own or in groups as they ride the waves beside us.
Lastly, I want to mention the caves.
Tasmania is famous for its caves
and the ones we'll pass by are so amazing that people are lost for words when they see them.
They can only be approached by sea.
but if you feel that you want to see more than we're able to show you,
then you can take a kayak into the area on another day
and one of our staff will give you more information on that.
What we'll do is to go through a narrow channel,
past some incredible rock formations
and from there we'll be able to see the openings to the caves,
and at that point we'll talk to you about what lies beyond.

1024,Cam17 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam17---test-1---part-3,93,"So, Tim, we have to do a short summary of our work experience on a farm.
Right. My farm was great,
but arranging the work experience was hard.
One problem was it was miles away and I don't drive.
And also, I'd really wanted a placement for a month,
but I could only get one for two weeks.
I was lucky,
the farmer let me stay on the farm so I didn't have to travel.
But finding the right sort of farm to apply to wasn't easy.
No, they don't seem to have websites, do they.
I found mine through a friend of my mother's, but it wasn't easy.
No.
My farm was mostly livestock, especially sheep.
I really enjoyed helping out with them.
I was up most of one night helping a sheep deliver a lamb...
On your own?
No, the farmer was there,
and he told me what to do.
It wasn't a straightforward birth, but I managed.
It was a great feeling to see the lamb stagger to its feet and start feeding almost straightaway,
and to know that it was OK.
Then another time a lamb had broken its leg,
and they got the vet in to set it,
and he talked me through what he was doing.
That was really useful.
Yes, my farm had sheep too.
The farm was in a valley and they had a lowland breed called Suffolks,
although the farmer said they'd had other breeds in the past.
So were they bred for their meat?
Mostly, yes.
They're quite big and solid.
My farm was up in the hills and they had a different breed of sheep,
they were Cheviots.
Oh, I heard their wool's really sought after.
Yes. It's very hardwearing and they use it for carpets.
Right.
I was interested in the amount of supplements they add to animals' feed nowadays.
Like, even the chickens got extra vitamins and electrolytes in their feed.
Yes, I found that too.
And they're not cheap.
But my farmer said some are overpriced for what they are.
And he didn't give them as a matter of routine,
just at times when the chickens seemed to particularly require them.
Yes, mine said the same.
He said certain breeds of chickens might need more supplements than the others,
but the cheap and expensive ones are all basically the same.
So did your farm have any other livestock, Diana?
Yes, dairy cows.
I made a really embarrassing mistake when I was working in the milk shed.
Some cows had been treated with antibiotics,
so their milk wasn't suitable for human consumption,
and it had to be put in a separate container.
But I got mixed up,
and I poured some milk from the wrong cow in with the milk for humans,
so the whole lot had to be thrown away.
The farmer wasn't too happy with me.
I asked my farmer how much he depended on the vet to deal with health problems.
I'd read reports that the livestock's health is being affected
as farmers are under pressure to increase production.
Well, he didn't agree with that,
but he said that actually some of the stuff the vets do, like minor operations,
he'd be quite capable of doing himself.
Yeah. My farmer said the same.
But he reckons vets' skills are still needed.
Now we've got to give a bit of feedback about last term's modules,
just short comments, apparently.
Shall we do that now?
OK.
So medical terminology.
Well, my heart sank when I saw that,
especially right at the beginning of the course.
And I did struggle with it.
I thought it'd be hard,
but actually I found it all quite straightforward.
What did you think about diet and nutrition?
OK, I suppose.
Do you remember what they told us about pet food
and the fact that there's such limited checking into whether or not it's contaminated?
I mean in comparison with the checks on food for humans,
I thought that was terrible.
I think the module that really impressed me was the animal disease one,
when we looked at domesticated animals in different parts of the world,
like camels and water buffalo and alpaca.
The economies of so many countries depend on these,
but scientists don't know much about the diseases that affect them.
Yes,
I thought they'd know a lot about ways of controlling and eradicating those diseases,
but that's not the case at all.
I loved the wildlife medication unit.
Things like helping birds that have been caught in oil spills.
That's something I hadn't thought about before.
Yeah, I thought I might write my dissertation on something connected with that.
Right. So, actually I was thinking...

1025,Cam17 - Test 1 - Part 4,B2,cam17---test-1---part-4,62,"Labyrinths have existed for well over 4,000 years.
Labyrinths and labyrinthine symbols have been found in regions as diverse as modern-day Turkey,
Ireland, Greece, and India
There are various designs of labyrinth
but what they all have in common is a winding spiral path which leads to a central area
There is one starting point at the entrance and the goal is to reach the central area.
Finding your way through a labyrinth involves many twists and turns,
but it's not possible to get lost as there is only one single path.
In modern times, the word labyrinth has taken on a different meaning
and is often used as a synonym for a maze.
A maze is quite different
as it is a kind of puzzle with an intricate network of paths.
Mazes became fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe,
and can still be found in the gardens of great houses and palaces.
The paths are usually surrounded by thick, high hedges so that it's not possible to see over them.
Entering a maze usually involves getting lost a few times
before using logic to work out the pattern and find your way to the centre and then out again.
There are lots of dead ends and paths which lead you back to where you started.
The word 'maze' is believed to come from a Scandinavian word for a state of confusion.
This is where the word 'amazing' comes from.
Labyrinths, on the other hand, have a very different function.
Although people now often refer to things they find complicated as labyrinths,
this is not how they were seen in the past.
The winding spiral of the labyrinth has been used for centuries as a metaphor for life's journey.
It served as a spiritual reminder that there is purpose and meaning to our lives
and helped to give people a sense of direction.
Labyrinths are thought to encourage a feeling of calm
and have been used as a meditation and prayer tool in many cultures over many centuries.
The earliest examples of the labyrinth spiral pattern have been found carved into stone,
from Sardinia to Scandinavia, from Arizona to India to Africa.
In Europe, these spiral carvings date from the late Bronze Age.
The Native American Pima tribe wove baskets with a circular labyrinth design that depicted their own cosmology.
In Ancient Greece, the labyrinth spiral was used on coins around 4000 years ago.
Labyrinths made of mosaics were commonly found in bathhouses,
villas and tombs throughout the Roman Empire.
In Northern Europe, there were actual physical labyrinths designed for walking on.
These were cut into the turf or grass, usually in a circular pattern.
The origin of these walking labyrinths remains unclear,
but they were probably used for fertility rites
which may date back thousands of years.
Eleven examples of turf labyrinths survive today,
including the largest one at Saffron Walden, England,
which used to have a large tree in the middle of it.
More recently labyrinths have experienced something of a revival.
Some believe that walking a labyrinth promotes healing and mindfulness,
and there are those who believe in its emotional and physical benefits,
which include slower breathing
and a restored sense of balance and perspective.
This idea has become so popular that labyrinths have been laid into the floors of spas, wellness centres
and even prisons in recent years.
A pamphlet at Colorado Children's Hospital informs patients that
'walking a labyrinth can often calm people in the midst of a crisis'.
And apparently, it's not only patients who benefit.
Many visitors find walking a labyrinth less stressful than sitting in a corridor or waiting room.
Some doctors even walk the labyrinth during their breaks.
In some hospitals, patients who can't walk
can have a paper 'finger labyrinth' brought to their bed.
The science behind the theory is a little sketchy,
but there are dozens of small-scale studies which support claims about the benefits of labyrinths.
For example, one study found that walking a labyrinth provided 'short-term calming,
relaxation, and relief from anxiety' for Alzheimer's patients.
So, what is it about labyrinths that makes their appeal so universal?...

1026,Cam17 - Test 2 - Part 1,B2,cam17---test-2---part-1,10,"Hello, Jane Fairbanks speaking.
Oh, good morning.
My name's Frank Pritchard.
I've just retired and moved to Southoe.
I'd like to become a volunteer,
and I gather you co-ordinate voluntary work in the village.
That's right.
What sort of thing could I do?
Well, we need help with the village library.
We borrow books from the town library,
and individuals also donate them.
So, one thing you could do is get involved in collecting them,
if you've got a car, that is.
Yes, that's no problem.
The times are pretty flexible so we can arrange it to suit you.
Oh, another thing is the records that we keep of the books we're given,
and those we borrow and need to return to the town library.
It would be very useful to have another person to help keep them up to date.
Right.
I'm used to working on a computer.
I presume they're computerised?
Oh yes.
Is the library purpose-built?
I haven't noticed it when I've walked round the village.
No, we simply have the use of a room in the village hall,
the West Room.
It's on the left as you go in.
I must go and have a look inside the hall.
Yes, it's a nice building.
Do you run a lunch club in the village for elderly people?
I know a lot of places do.
Yes, we have a very successful club.
I could help with transport, if that's of any use.
Oh definitely!
People come to the club from neighbouring villages,
and we're always in need of more drivers.
And does the club have groups that focus on a particular hobby, too?
I could get involved in one or two,
particularly if there are any art groups.
Excellent.
I'll find out where we need help and get back to you.
Fine.
What about help for individual residents.
Do you arrange that at all?
Yes, we do it as a one-off.
In fact, there's Mrs Carroll.
She needs a lift to the hospital next week,
and we're struggling to find someone.
When's her appointment?
On Tuesday. It would take the whole morning.
I could do that.
Oh, that would be great. Thank you.
And also, next week,
we're arranging to have some work done to Mr Selsbury's house before he moves,
as he isn't healthy enough to do it himself.
We've got some people to decorate his kitchen,
but if you could do some weeding in his garden,
that would be wonderful.
OK. I'd enjoy that.
And presumably the day and time are flexible.
Oh yes. Just say when would suit you best, and we'll let Mr Selsbury know.
Good.
The volunteers group also organises monthly social events,
which is a great way to meet other people, of course.
So next month, on the 19th of October,
we're holding a quiz,
a couple of residents are great at planning unusual ones,
and we always fill the village hall.
That sounds like fun.
Can I do anything to help?
Well, because of the number of people,
we need plenty of refreshments for halfway through.
So, if you could provide any, we'd be grateful.
I'm sure I could.
I'll think about what to make, and let you know.
Thank you.
Then on November the 18th,
we're holding a dance, also in the village hall.
We've booked a band that specialises in music of the 1930s,
they've been before, and we've had a lot of requests to bring them back.
I'm not really a dancer, but I'd like to do something to help.
Well, we sell tickets in advance,
and having an extra person to check them at the door, as people arrive, would be good,
it can be quite a bottleneck if everyone arrives at once!
OK, I'm happy with that.
Oh, we're also arranging a New Year's Eve party.
We're expecting that to be a really big event,
so instead of the village hall, it'll be held in the Mountfort Hotel.
The...?
Mountfort.
Mountfort Hotel.
It isn't in Southoe itself, but it's only a couple of miles away.
The hotel will be providing dinner and we've booked a band.
The one thing we haven't got yet is a poster.
That isn't something you could do, by any chance, is it?
Well actually, yes.
Before I retired I was a graphic designer, so that's right up my street.
Oh perfect!
I'll give you the details,
and then perhaps you could send me a draft...
Of course.

1027,Cam17 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam17---test-2---part-2,59,"Good morning, and welcome to Oniton Hall,
one of the largest estates in the area.
My name's Nick, and I'm one of the guides.
I'll give you a brief introduction to the estate while you're sitting down,
and then we'll walk round.
The estate consists of the house, gardens, parkland and farm,
and it dates back to the fourteenth century.
The original house was replaced in the late seventeenth century,
and of course it has had a large number of owners.
Almost all of them have left their mark,
generally by adding new rooms, like the ballroom and conservatory,
or by demolishing others.
The farm looks much as it's always done,
although the current owner has done a great deal of work to the flower beds.
In the seventeenth century, the estate was owned by a very wealthy man called Sir Edward Downes.
His intention was to escape from the world of politics,
after years as an active politician,
and to build a new house worthy of his big collection of books, paintings and sculptures.
He broke off contact with his former political allies,
and hosted meetings of creative and literary people, like painters and poets.
Unusually for his time, he didn't care whether his guests were rich or poor,
as long as they had talent.
Big houses like Oniton had dozens of servants until the 1920s or 30s,
and we've tried to show what their working lives were like.
Photographs of course don't give much of an idea,
so instead, as you go round the house,
you'll see volunteers dressed up as nineteenth-century servants, going about their work.
They'll explain what they're doing,
and tell you their recipes, or what tools they're using.
We've just introduced this feature to replace the audio guide we used to have available.
I see there are a number of children here with you today.
Well, we have several activities specially for children,
like dressing up in the sorts of clothes that children wore in the past,
and as it's a fine day, some of you will probably want to play in the adventure playground.
Our latest addition is child-sized tractors, that you can drive around the grounds.
We'll also be going into the farm that's part of the estate, where there's plenty to do.
Most of the buildings date from the eighteenth century,
so you can really step back into an agricultural past.
Until recently, the dairy was where milk from the cows was turned into cheese.
It's now the place to go for lunch, or afternoon tea,
or just a cup of coffee and a slice of homemade cake.
The big stone building that dominates the farm is the large barn,
and in here is our collection of agricultural tools.
These were used in the past to plough the earth, sow seeds, make gates, and much more.
There's a small barn, also made of stone,
where you can groom the donkeys and horses, to keep their coats clean.
They really seem to enjoy having it done,
and children love grooming them.
The horses no longer live in the stables,
which instead is the place to go to buy gifts, books,
our own jams and pickles, and clothes and blankets made of wool from our sheep.
Outside the shed, which is the only brick building,
you can climb into a horse-drawn carriage for a lovely, relaxing tour of the park and farm.
The carriages are well over a hundred years old.
And finally, the parkland, which was laid out in the eighteenth century,
with a lake and trees that are now well established.
You'll see types of cattle and sheep that are hardly ever found on farms these days.
We're helping to preserve them, to stop their numbers falling further.
OK, well, if you'd like to come with me, we will start...

1028,Cam17 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam17---test-2---part-3,79,"Did you make notes while you were watching the performances of Romeo and Juliet, Gemma?
Yes, I did. I found it quite hard though.
I kept getting too involved in the play.
Me too.
I ended up not taking notes.
I wrote down my impressions when I got home.
Do you mind if I check a few things with you?
In case I've missed anything.
And I've also got some questions about our assignment.
No, it's good to talk things through.
I may have missed things too.
OK great.
So first of all,
I'm not sure how much information we should include in our reviews.
Right. Well, I don't think we need to describe what happens.
Especially as Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most well-known plays.
Yeah, everyone knows the story.
In an essay we'd focus on the poetry and Shakespeare's use of imagery etc.,
but that isn't really relevant in a review.
We're supposed to focus on how effective this particular production is.
We should say what made it a success or a failure.
And part of that means talking about the emotional impact the performance had on us.
I think that's important.
Yes.
And we should definitely mention how well the director handled important bits of the play -
like when Romeo climbs onto Juliet's balcony.
And the fight between Mercutio and Tybalt.
Yes.
It would also be interesting to mention the theatre space
and how the director used it
but I don't think we'll have space in 800 words.
No. OK.
That all sounds quite straightforward.
So what about The Emporium Theatre's production of the play?
I thought some things worked really well but there were some problems too.
Yeah. What about the set, for example?
I think it was visually really stunning.
I'd say that was probably the most memorable thing about this production.
You're right. The set design was really amazing,
but actually I have seen similar ideas used in other productions.
What about the lighting?
Some of the scenes were so dimly lit it was quite hard to see.
I didn't dislike it.
It helped to change the mood of the quieter scenes.
That's a good point.
What did you think of the costumes?
I was a bit surprised by the contemporary dress, I must say.
Yeah - I think it worked well, but I had assumed it would be more conventional.
Me too.
I liked the music at the beginning and I thought the musicians were brilliant,
but I thought they were wasted because the music didn't have much impact in Acts 2 and 3.
Yes - that was a shame.
One problem with this production was that the actors didn't deliver the lines that well.
They were speaking too fast.
It was a problem I agree,
but I thought it was because they weren't speaking loudly enough,
especially at key points in the play.
I actually didn't have a problem with that.
It's been an interesting experience watching different versions of Romeo and Juliet, hasn't it?
Definitely.
It's made me realise how relevant the play still is.
Right. I mean a lot's changed since Shakespeare's time,
but in many ways nothing's changed.
There are always disagreements and tension between teenagers and their parents.
Yes, that's something all young people can relate to -
more than the violence and the extreme emotions in the play.
How did you find watching it in translation?
Really interesting.
I expected to find it more challenging, but I could follow the story pretty well.
I stopped worrying about not being able to understand all the words and focused on the actors' expressions.
The ending was pretty powerful.
Yes. That somehow intensified the emotion for me.
Did you know Shakespeare's been translated into more languages than any other writer?
What's the reason for his international appeal, do you think?
I was reading that it's because his plays are about basic themes that people everywhere are familiar with.
Yeah, and they can also be understood on different levels.
The characters have such depth.
Right - which allows directors to experiment and find new angles.
That's really important...

1029,Cam17 - Test 2 - Part 4,C1,cam17---test-2---part-4,70,"Right, everyone, let's make a start.
Over the past few sessions,
we've been considering the reasons why some world languages are in decline,
and today I'm going to introduce another factor that affects languages,
and the speakers of those languages,
and that's technology, and, in particular, digital technology.
In order to illustrate its effect,
I'm going to focus on the Icelandic language,
which is spoken by around 321,000 people,
most of whom live in Iceland - an island in the North Atlantic Ocean.
The problem for this language is not the number of speakers,
even though this number is small.
Nor is it about losing words to other languages, such as English.
In fact, the vocabulary of Icelandic is continually increasing
because when speakers need a new word for something,
they tend to create one, rather than borrowing from another language.
All this makes Icelandic quite a special language,
it's changed very little in the past millennium,
yet it can handle twenty-first-century concepts related to the use of computers and digital technology.
Take, for example, the word for web browser...
this is vafri in Icelandic,
which comes from the verb 'to wander'.
I can't think of a more appropriate term because that's exactly what you do mentally when you browse the internet.
Then there's an Icelandic word for podcast,
which is too hard to pronounce!
And so on.
Icelandic, then, is alive and growing, but - and it's a big but,
young Icelanders spend a great deal of time in the digital world
and this world is predominantly English.
Think about smartphones.
They didn't even exist until comparatively recently,
but today young people use them all the time to read books, watch TV or films,
play games, listen to music, and so on.
Obviously, this is a good thing in many respects because it promotes their bilingual skills,
but the extent of the influence of English in the virtual world is staggering
and it's all happening really fast.
For their parents and grandparents,
the change is less concerning because they already have their native-speaker skills in Icelandic.
But for young speakers -
well, the outcome is a little troubling.
For example, teachers have found that playground conversations in Icelandic secondary schools
can be conducted entirely in English,
while teachers of much younger children have reported situations
where their classes find it easier to say what is in a picture using English, rather than Icelandic.
The very real and worrying consequence of all this
is that the young generation in Iceland is at risk of losing its mother tongue.
Of course, this is happening to other European languages too,
but while internet companies might be willing to offer, say, French options in their systems,
it's much harder for them to justify the expense of doing the same for a language
that has a population the size of a French town, such as Nice.
The other drawback of Icelandic is the grammar,
which is significantly more complex than in most languages.
At the moment, the tech giants are simply not interested in tackling this.
So, what is the Icelandic government doing about this?
Well, large sums of money are being allocated to a language technology fund
that it is hoped will lead to the development of Icelandic sourced apps
and other social media and digital systems,
but clearly this is going to be an uphill struggle.
On the positive side,
they know that Icelandic is still the official language of education and government.
It has survived for well over a thousand years
and the experts predict that its future in this nation state is sound and will continue to be so.
However, there's no doubt that it's becoming an inevitable second choice in young people's lives.
This raises important questions.
When you consider how much of the past is tied up in a language,
will young Icelanders lose their sense of their own identity?
Another issue that concerns the government of Iceland is this.
If children are learning two languages through different routes,
neither of which they are fully fluent in,
will they be able to express themselves properly?

1030,Cam17 - Test 3 - Part 1,B1,cam17---test-3---part-1,81,"Jack, I'm thinking of taking the kids to the seaside on a surfing holiday this summer
and I wanted to ask your advice
as I know you're such an expert.
Well, I don't know about that,
but yes, I've done a bit of surfing over the years.
I'd thoroughly recommend it.
I think it's the kind of holiday all the family can enjoy together.
The thing about surfing is that it's great for all ages and all abilities.
My youngest started when he was only three!
Wow!
But it's quite physically demanding, isn't it?
I've heard you need to be pretty fit.
Yes. You'll certainly learn more quickly and won't tire as easily.
Well - that should be OK for us.
You've been surfing a few times in Ireland, haven't you?
Yes.
There's some great surfing there, which people don't always realise.
And which locations would you recommend?
There seem to be quite a few.
Yes, there are loads.
Last year we went to County Donegal.
There are several great places to surf there.
What about in County Clare?
I read that's also really good for surfing.
Yes, it is.
I've been there a few times.
Most people go to Lahinch.
My kids love it there.
The waves aren't too challenging and the town is very lively.
Are there good hotels there?
Yes - some very nice ones
and there are also a few basic hostels and campsites.
It's great if you need lessons as the surf schools are excellent.
Sounds good.
Yes and there's lots to see in the area,
like those well-known cliffs...
I've forgotten the name of them...
Oh don't worry - I can look them up.
I've also been surfing in County Mayo,
which is less well-known for surfing, but we had a really good time.
That was a few years ago when the kids were younger.
There's a good surf school at Carrowniskey beach.
How do you spell that?
Carrowniskey
OK.
I put the kids into the surf camp they run during the summer for 10-16 year olds
Oh right.
How long was that for?
Three hours every day for a week.
It was perfect.
They were so tired out after that.
I can imagine.
One thing we did while the kids were surfing
was to rent some kayaks to have a look around the bay which is nearby.
It's really beautiful.
Oh, I'd love to do that.
Now the only time I went to Ireland it rained practically every day.
Yes, that can be a problem,
but you can surf in the rain, you know.
It doesn't have the same appeal, somehow.
Well, the weather's been fine the last couple of years when I've been there,
but actually, it tends to rain more in August than in the spring or autumn.
September's my favourite month because the water is warmer then.
The only problem is that the kids are back to school then.
I know.
But one good thing about Irish summers is that it doesn't get too hot.
The average temperature is about 19 degrees
and it usually doesn't go above 25 degrees.
That sounds alright.
Now what about costs?
Surfing is a pretty cheap holiday really,
the only cost is the hire of equipment.
You can expect to pay a daily rate of about 30 euros for the hire of a wetsuit and board,
but you can save about 40 euros if you hire by the week.
That's not too bad.
No.
It's important to make sure you get good quality wetsuits.
You'll all get too cold if you don't.
And make sure you also get boots.
They keep your feet warm and it's easier to surf with them on too.
OK. Well, thanks very much...

1031,Cam17 - Test 3 - Part 2,B1,cam17---test-3---part-2,79,"Good afternoon.
My name's Mrs Carter
and I run the before and after school extended hours childcare service.
I hope you've had a chance to have a good look around the school and talk to staff and pupils.
I know that many of you are interested in using our childcare service
when your child joins the school,
and perhaps you already know something about it,
but for those that don't, I'll go through the main details now.
We offer childcare for children from the ages of four to eleven
both before and after school.
I know that many parents who work find this service invaluable.
You can leave your child with us safe in the knowledge that they will be extremely well cared for.
We are insured to provide care for up to 70 children,
although we rarely have this many attending at any one session.
I think we generally expect around 50 to 60 children for the afternoon sessions
and about half that number for the breakfast sessions.
Although we currently do have 70 children registered with us,
not all of these attend every day.
It's ten years since we began offering an extended hours service
and we've come a long way during that time.
When we first opened, we only had about 20 children attending regularly.
We try to keep our costs as low as we can
and we think we provide very good value for money.
For the afternoon sessions, which run from 3:30 until 6 p.m.,
it's ¬£7.20.
But if you prefer, you can pay for one hour only,
which costs ¬£3.50
or two hours which costs ¬£5.70.
The cost of the childcare includes food and snacks.
They'll be given breakfast in the morning
and in the afternoon, a healthy snack as soon as they finish school.
At 5 p.m. children are given something more substantial,
such as pasta or a casserole.
Please inform us of any allergies that your child might have
and we'll make sure they're offered a suitable alternative.
As you may know,
the childcare service runs through the school holidays from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
We offer a really varied and exciting programme to keep the children entertained,
we don't want them to feel as if they are still at school!
It will also feel different
because they'll get the chance to make new friends with children from other schools.
Spaces are available for them
because a lot of our term-time children don't always attend during the holiday.
In the past,
parents have asked if children over the age of 11 are allowed to come with their younger brothers and sisters,
but I'm afraid we're unable to do this
because of the type of insurance we have.
So now let me tell you about some of the activities that your child can do during the after-school sessions.
As well as being able to use the playground equipment, computers and the library,
there is usually at least one 'special' activity that children can do each day.
For example, Spanish.
We have a specialist teacher coming in every Thursday
to give a basic introduction to the language through games and songs.
She does two sessions:
one for the over 8s and one for the younger children.
This is the only activity which we have to make an extra charge for
but it's well worth it.
Once a week the children have the opportunity to do some music.
We're very lucky that one of our staff is a member of a folk band.
On Mondays, she teaches singing and percussion to groups of children.
We do rely on parental support for this,
so if any of you sing or play an instrument
and would be prepared to help out at these sessions, we'd be delighted.
Painting continues to be one of the most popular activities.
To begin with we weren't keen on offering this because of the extra mess involved,
but children kept asking if they could do some art
and so we finally gave in.
Art is great for helping the children to relax after working hard at school all day.
Yoga is something that we've been meaning to introduce for some time
but haven't been able to find anyone available to teach it,
until now that is.
So we'll see how this goes.
Hopefully, children will benefit in all sorts of ways from this.
Cooking is another popular activity.
They make a different sort of cake, or pizza or bread each week.
Although the younger children love doing it,
we found that the mess was just too much,
so we've decided to restrict this to the over 8s,
as they are better able to clean up after themselves.

1032,Cam17 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam17---test-3---part-3,90,"Hello Dr Green,
I'm here to talk to you about my work placement.
Oh yes, it's Holly, isn't it?
Yes.
So, which work placement have you chosen?
I decided to go for the Orion Stadium placement.
The event I'll be managing is one where I'm helping to set up a sports competition for primary school children.
Yup. That's always a popular placement,
even though it can be tougher than you think working with children.
I know, but it's the fresh air that attracts me,
organising something indoors doesn't have the same appeal,
even though it might be fun.
OK, so obviously safety's going to be one of your key concerns for this event.
Yes, I've already thought about that.
I'll need to make sure none of the equipment's damaged.
Ah well, you'll be working with schools, so the equipment will be their responsibility.
However, the grounds and what goes on there will be yours.
Oh I see,
that'll include keeping everyone within the boundary once they're in their kit and on the field?
Exactly,
you'll need to inspect areas like changing rooms as well for anything someone can trip over,
but your main priority will be not to lose anyone!
Right.
I'll need staff to help with that.
And don't forget about the spectators.
I was thinking that many of them will be parents, who could help run the event.
I wouldn't rely on that.
They'll be more interested in filming their children than volunteering.
I'll need to make sure they don't interfere with events doing that!
And that's not always easy,
especially when a proud parent's trying to get a snap of their child
and you want them to move elsewhere.
OK.
What about the scheduling?
With sporting events there are all sorts of things that can alter the timetable,
like rain, for instance, though so far, we've always been lucky with that.
Yeah, and I was thinking about what to do if someone got hurt as well.
I know that last year that caused a terrible delay.
You have to be prepared for such things.
Oh. What if a match ends in a draw,
do you let the teams keep going until someone wins?
That'll be up to you,
and again, you need to plan for it.
Right.
Now, the aim of your work placement is to give you the opportunity to develop the skills that an events manager needs.
So, let's talk about those a bit.
Well, I think my communication skills are pretty good.
I can talk on the phone to people and book venues and that kind of thing.
Good, just remember it isn't only about what you say.
If you meet someone face-to-face and want to persuade them to be a sponsor, for example‚Ä¶
Oh, I'll dress up for that! Sure.
Good.
Let's go on to think about your organisational skills.
You're working in a very people-based industry
and that means things won't always go to plan.
I guess it's being prepared to make changes that matters.
That's right.
You may have to make an on-the-spot change to a timetable because of a problem you hadn't anticipated...
...just do it! OK
How's your time management these days?
I'm working on it,
I'm certainly better when I have a deadline, which is why this work suits me.
Yes, but it's how you respond as that deadline approaches!
I know I've got to look calm even if I'm in a panic.
Just think to yourself,
no one must know I'm under pressure.
Yeah, even though I'm multi-tasking like crazy!
Another skill that events managers need is creativity.
Often your client has what we call the 'big picture' idea,
but it's up to the events manager to think of all the fine points that go to making it work.
Right, so I need to listen carefully to that idea and then fill in all the gaps.
That's right.
And you'll have a team working under you,
so another key skill is leadership.
Your team may have lots of ideas too,
but you've got to make the ultimate choices.
Do we have refreshments inside or out, for example?
Isn't it better to be democratic?
It's a nice idea, but you have the ultimate responsibility.
So, believe in what you think best.
Be prepared to say 'yes', that's a good idea but it won't work here.
I see what you mean.
What about the networking side of things?
I know it's an area that a lot of students worry about
because we don't have much experience to offer others.
But even without it, you can still be an interesting person with useful ideas.
And the more people you impress, the better.
I guess that will help me when I apply for a real job.
Exactly, think ahead, remember what your ambitions are and keep them in mind.
Definitely.

1033,Cam17 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam17---test-3---part-4,61,"Scientists believe that a majority of the earth's bird population migrate in some fashion or other.
Some travel seasonally for relatively short distances,
such as birds that move from their winter habitats in lowlands to mountain tops for the summers.
Others, like the Arctic Tern,
travel more than 25,000 miles seasonally between the northern and southern poles.
Bird migration has been studied over many centuries through a variety of observations.
But until relatively recently,
where birds went to in the winter was considered something of a mystery.
The lack of modern science and technology led to many theories that we now recognize as error-filled
and even somewhat amusing.
Take hibernation theory for example,
2000 years ago, it was commonly believed that when birds left an area,
they went underwater to hibernate in the seas and oceans.
Another theory for the regular appearance and disappearance of birds
was that they spend winter hidden in mud till the weather changed and food became abundant again.
The theory that some birds hibernate persisted until experiments were done on caged birds in the 1940s
which demonstrated that birds have no hibernation instinct.
One of the earliest naturalists and philosophers from ancient Greece was Aristotle
who was the first writer to discuss the disappearance and reappearance of some bird species at certain times of year.
He developed the theory of transmutation -
the seasonal change of one species into another -
by observing redstarts and robins.
He observed that in the autumn,
small birds called 'redstarts' began to lose their feathers,
which convinced Aristotle that they changed into robins for the winter,
and back into redstarts in the summer.
These assumptions are understandable given that this pair of species are similar in shape,
but are a classic example of an incorrect interpretation based on correct observations.
The most bizarre theory was put forward by an English amateur scientist,
Charles Morton, in the seventeenth century.
He wrote a surprisingly well-regarded paper
claiming that birds migrate to the moon and back every year.
He came to this conclusion as the only logical explanation for the total disappearance of some species.
One of the key moments in the development of migration theory came in 1822
when a white stork was shot in Germany.
This particular stork made history because of the long spear in its neck
which incredibly had not killed it,
everyone immediately realised this spear was definitely not European.
It turned out to be a spear from a tribe in Central Africa.
This was a truly defining moment in the history of ornithology
because it was the first evidence that storks spend their winters in sub-Saharan Africa.
You can still see the 'arrow stork' in the Zoological Collection of the University of Rostock in Germany.
People gradually became aware that European birds moved south in autumn and north in summer
but didn't know much about it until the practice of catching birds and putting rings on their legs became established.
Before this, very little information was available about the actual destinations of particular species
and how they travelled there.
People speculated that larger birds provided a kind of taxi service for smaller birds
by carrying them on their backs.
This idea came about
because it seemed impossible that small birds weighing only a few grams could fly over vast oceans.
This idea was supported by observations of bird behaviour
such as the harassment of larger birds by smaller birds.
The development of bird ringing, by a Danish schoolteacher,
Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen,
made many discoveries possible.
This is still common practice today and relies upon what is known as 'recovery',
this is when ringed birds are found dead in the place they have migrated to, and identified.
Huge amounts of data were gathered in the early part of the twentieth century
and for the first time in history people understood where birds actually went to in winter.
In 1931, an atlas was published showing where the most common species of European birds migrated to.
More recent theories about bird migration...

1034,Cam17 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam17---test-4---part-1,70,"Hello, Easy Life Cleaning Services, Jacinta speaking.
Oh hello.
I'm looking for a cleaning service for my apartment,
do you do domestic cleaning?
Sure.
Well, it's just a one-bedroom flat.
Do you have a basic cleaning package?
Yes.
For a one-bedroom flat we're probably looking at about two hours for a clean.
So we'd do a thorough clean of all surfaces in each room,
and polish them where necessary.
Does your apartment have carpets?
No, I don't have any, but the floor would need cleaning.
Of course, we'd do that in every room.
And we'd do a thorough clean of the kitchen and bathroom.
OK.
Then we have some additional services which you can request if you want,
so for example, we can clean your oven for you every week.
Actually, I hardly ever use that,
but can you do the fridge?
Sure.
Would you like that done every week?
Yes, definitely.
And would ironing clothes be an additional service you can do?
Yes, of course.
It wouldn't be much, just my shirts for work that week.
That's fine.
And we could also clean your microwave if you want.
No, I wipe that out pretty regularly so there's no need for that.
We also offer additional services that you might want a bit less often, say every month.
So for example, if the inside of your windows need cleaning, we could do that.
Yes, that'd be good.
I'm on the fifteenth floor, so the outside gets done regularly by specialists,
but the inside does get a bit grubby.
And we could arrange for your curtains to get cleaned if necessary.
No, they're OK.
But would you be able to do something about the balcony?
It's quite small and I don't use it much,
but it could do with a wash every month or so.
Yes, we can get the pressure washer onto that.
Now if you're interested,
we do offer some other possibilities to do with general maintenance.
For example, if you have a problem with water and you need a plumber in a hurry,
we can put you in touch with a reliable one who can come out straightaway.
And the same thing if you need an electrician.
Right. That's good to know.
I've only just moved here so I don't have any of those sorts of contacts.
And I don't know if this is of interest to you,
but we also offer a special vacuum cleaning system
which can improve the indoor air quality of your home by capturing up to 99% of all the dust in the air.
So if you're troubled by allergies, this can make a big difference.
Right. In fact, I don't have that sort of problem, but I'll bear it in mind.
Now can you tell me a bit about your cleaning staff?
Of course.
So all our cleaners are very carefully selected.
When they apply to us, they have to undergo a security check with the police
to make sure they don't have any sort of criminal background,
and, of course, they have to provide references as well.
Then if we think they might be suitable for the job, we give them training for it.
That lasts for two weeks so it's very thorough,
and at the end of it, they have a test.
If they pass that, we take them on,
but we monitor them very carefully,
we ask all our clients to complete a review of their performance after every visit and to email it to us.
So we can pick up any problems straightaway and deal with them.
OK, well that all sounds good.
And will I always have the same cleaner?
Yes, we do our best to organise it that way, and we usually manage it.
Good. That's fine.
Right, so I'd like to go ahead and...

1035,Cam17 - Test 4 - Part 2,B2,cam17---test-4---part-2,64,"As many of you here today have worked in the hotel industry for some time,
I'm sure you have experienced the problem of high staff turnover in your hotels.
Every hotel relies on having loyal and experienced members of staff
who make sure that everything runs smoothly.
If staff are constantly changing,
it can make life difficult for everyone.
But why do staff leave frequently in many hotels?
Of course, many hotel jobs, such as cleaning, are low-skilled and are not well-paid.
A lot of managers think it's this and the long hours that are the main causes of high staff turnover -
but what they don't realise is that it's the lack of training in many hotel jobs which is a huge factor.
So, what kind of problems does a high turnover of staff cause?
Well, having to recruit new staff all the time can be very time-consuming,
and managers may have to cover some duties while waiting for new staff to arrive.
This means they don't have time to think about less immediate problems
such as how to improve their service.
When staff leave, it can also severely affect the colleagues they leave behind.
It has a negative effect on remaining staff,
who may start to feel that they too should be thinking about leaving.
So, what can be done to change this situation?
Firstly, managers should stop making basic errors
which leave their staff feeling upset and resentful.
When organising shifts, for example,
make sure you never give certain staff preferential treatment.
All staff should be given some choice about when they work,
and everyone should have to work some evening and weekend shifts.
If you treat staff fairly,
they'll be more likely to step in and help when extra staff are needed.
Keeping staff happy has other tangible benefits for the business.
Take the Dunwich Hotel as an example.
It had been experiencing a problem with staff complaints
and in order to deal with this,
invested in staff training
and improved staff conditions.
Not only did the level of complaints fall,
but they also noticed a significant increase in the amount each customer spent during their stay.
They have now introduced a customer loyalty scheme
which is going really well.
Now I'd like to look at some ways you can reduce staff turnover in your hotels,
and I'll do this by giving some examples of hotels where I've done some training recently.
The Sun Club received feedback which showed that staff thought managers didn't value their opinions.
They weren't made to feel they were partners who were contributing to the success of the business as a whole.
This situation has changed.
Junior staff at all levels are regularly invited to meetings where their ideas are welcomed.
A year ago, The Portland recognised the need to invest in staff retention.
Their first step was to introduce a scheme for recognising talent amongst their employees.
The hope is that organising training for individuals with management potential will encourage them to stay with the business.
At Bluewater, managers decided to recognise 50 high achievers from across the company's huge hotel chain.
As a reward, they're sent on an all-expenses-paid trip abroad every year.
Fun is an important element in the trips,
but there's also the opportunity to learn something useful.
This year's trip included a visit to a brewery,
where staff learned about the new beer that would be served in the hotel.
Pentlow Hotels identified that retention of junior reception staff was an issue.
In order to encourage them to see that working in a hotel could be worthwhile and rewarding, with good prospects,
they introduced a management programme.
These staff were given additional responsibilities and the chance to work in various roles in the hotel.
Green Planets wanted to be seen as a caring employer.
To make life easier for staff, many of whom had childcare responsibilities,
the hotel began issuing vouchers to help cover the cost of childcare.
Louise Marsh at The Amesbury has one of the best staff retention rates in the business.
Since she joined the company,
she's made a huge effort to achieve this by creating a co-operative and supportive environment.
For her, the staff are part of a large family where everyone is valued.
OK, now I'd like to...

1036,Cam17 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam17---test-4---part-3,88,"Hi Thomas, how are you enjoying the course so far?
Yeah, I think it's good.
Remind me, why did you decide to study sports science?
Didn't you want to be a professional athlete when you were at school?
Yeah, that was my goal,
and all my classmates assumed I would achieve it; they thought I was brilliant.
That must have been a nice feeling.
Mm, I thought I could win anything.
There was no one who could run faster than me.
Exactly, so what happened?
Did your mum and dad want you to be more 'academic'?
Not at all.
Perhaps they should have pushed me harder, though.
What do you mean?
I think I should have practised more.
What makes you say that?
Well, I went out to Kenya for a couple of weeks to train...
Really! I didn't know that.
I was chosen to go there out of loads of kids and run with some of the top teenage athletes in the world.
And... I was so calm about it.
I just kept thinking how fortunate I was.
What a great chance this was!
Everyone back home was so proud of me.
But once we started competing, I very quickly realised I wasn't good enough.
That must have been a huge shock.
I thought 'this can't be happening'!
I was used to winning.
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's OK.
I'm over it now
and I think it's much better to do a university course
and this one has such a variety of sports-related areas.
It's going to be good.
Oh, I agree, I chose it because of that.
So Jeanne, have you thought of any ideas for the discussion session next week on technology and sport?
We have to cover more than one sport, don't we?
Yeah.
You know, we always think technology is about the future,
but we could gather some ideas about past developments in sport.
Look at early types of equipment perhaps?
I remember reading something about table tennis bats once,
how they ended up being covered with pimpled rubber.
Cos they were just wooden at first, I'd imagine.
Yeah.
In about the 1920s,
a factory was making rolls of the rubber in bulk for something like horse harnesses.
Really!
Yeah, and someone realised that it would make a perfect covering for the wooden bats.
So what about cricket,
that's had a few innovative changes.
Maybe the pads they wear on their legs?
I don't think they've changed much but, I'm just looking on the internet...
and it says that when the first cricket helmet came in, in 1978,
the Australian batsman who first wore it was booed and jeered by people watching because it was so ugly!
Wow, players have to protect themselves from getting hurt!
I mean everyone wears one now.
Mm, unlike the cycle helmet.
Well, unless you're a professional,
but you're right, many ordinary bikers don't wear a helmet.
Hey, look at these pictures of original helmet designs.
This one looks like an upside-down bowl!
Yet, the woman's laughing,
she's so proud to be wearing it!
It says serious cyclists ended up with wet hair from all the hard exercise.
I guess that's why they have large air vents in them now
so that the skin can breathe more easily.
OK, so we've done helmets.
What about golf balls or better still golf clubs,
they've changed a lot.
Yeah, I remember my great grandfather telling me that because a club was made entirely of wood,
it would easily break and players had to get another.
There's no wood at all in them now, is there?
No, they're much more powerful.
The same must be true of hockey sticks.
I don't think so because players still use wooden sticks today.
What it does say here, though,
is that when the game started you had to produce a stick yourself.
I guess they just weren't being manufactured.
So, one more perhaps.
What about football?
Well, I know the first balls were made of animal skin.
Yeah, they covered them with pieces of leather that were stitched together,
but... the balls let in water when it rained.
Oh, that would have made them much heavier.
That's right.
You can imagine the damage to player's necks when the ball was headed.
Oh, how painful that must have been!
Yeah, well, I think we can put together some useful ideas...

1037,Cam17 - Test 4 - Part 4,B2,cam17---test-4---part-4,80,"Hello everyone.
Today we're going to look at another natural food product
and that's maple syrup.
What is this exactly?
Well, maple syrup looks rather like clear honey,
but it's not made by bees;
it's produced from the plant fluid, or sap, inside the maple tree
and that makes maple syrup a very natural product.
Maple syrup is a thick, golden, sweet-tasting liquid
that can be bought in bottles or jars
and poured onto food such as waffles and ice cream
or used in the baking of cakes and pastries.
It contains no preservatives or added ingredients,
and it provides a healthy alternative to refined sugar.
Let's just talk a bit about the maple tree itself,
which is where maple syrup comes from.
So, there are many species of maple tree,
and they'll grow without fertilizer in areas where there's plenty of moisture in the soil.
However, they'll only do this if another important criterion is fulfilled,
which is that they must have full or partial sun exposure during the day and very cool nights,
and I'll talk more about that in a minute.
There are only certain parts of the world that provide all these conditions:
one is Canada,
and by that, I mean all parts of Canada,
and the other is the north-eastern states of North America.
In these areas, the climate suits the trees perfectly.
In fact, Canada produces over two-thirds of the world's maple syrup,
which is why the five-pointed maple leaf is a Canadian symbol
and has featured on the flag since 1964.
So how did maple syrup production begin?
Well, long before Europeans settled in these parts of the world,
the indigenous communities had started producing maple sugar.
They bored holes in the trunks of maple trees
and used containers made of tree bark to collect the liquid sap as it poured out.
As they were unable to keep the liquid for any length of time,
they didn't have storage facilities in those days,
they boiled the liquid by placing pieces of rock that had become scorching hot from the sun into the sap.
They did this until it turned into sugar,
and they were then able to use this to sweeten their food and drinks.
Since that time, improvements have been made to the process,
but it has changed very little overall.
So let's look at the production of maple syrup today.
Clearly, the maple forests are a valuable resource in many Canadian and North American communities.
The trees have to be well looked after
and they cannot be used to make syrup until the trunks reach a diameter of around 25 centimetres.
This can take anything up to 40 years.
As I've already mentioned,
maple trees need the right conditions to grow and also to produce sap.
Why is this?
Well, what happens is that during a cold night,
the tree absorbs water from the soil,
and that rises through the tree's vascular system.
But then in the warmer daytime,
the change in temperature causes the water to be pushed back down to the bottom of the tree.
This continual movement, up and down,
leads to the formation of the sap needed for maple syrup production.
When the tree is ready,
it can be tapped and this involves drilling a small hole into the trunk
and inserting a tube into it that ends in a bucket.
The trees can often take several taps,
though the workers take care not to cause any damage to the healthy growth of the tree itself.
The sap that comes out of the trees consists of 98% water
and 2% sugar and other nutrients.
It has to be boiled so that much of that water evaporates,
and this process has to take place immediately, using what are called evaporators.
These are basically extremely large pans,
the sap is poured into these,
a fire is built and the pans are then heated until the sap boils.
As it does this, the water evaporates, and the syrup begins to form.
The evaporation process creates large quantities of steam,
and the sap becomes thicker and denser, and, at just the right moment,
when the sap is thick enough to be called maple syrup,
the worker removes it from the heat.
After this process, something called 'sugar sand' has to be filtered out
as this builds up during the boiling and gives the syrup a cloudy appearance and a slightly gritty taste.
Once this has been done,
the syrup is ready to be packaged so that it can be used for a whole variety of products.
It takes 40 litres of sap to produce one litre of maple syrup
so you can get an idea of how much is needed!
So that's the basic process...

1038,Cam16 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam16---test-1---part-1,81,"Hello. Children's Engineering Workshops.
Oh hello.
I wanted some information about the workshops in the school holidays.
Sure.
I have two daughters who are interested.
The younger one's Lydia, she's four,
do you take children as young as that?
Yes,
our Tiny Engineers workshop is for four to five-year-olds.
What sorts of activities do they do?
All sorts.
For example, they work together to design a special cover that goes round an egg,
so that when it's inside they can drop it from a height and it doesn't break.
Well, sometimes it does break but that's part of the fun!
Right.
And Lydia loves building things.
Is there any opportunity for her to do that?
Well, they have a competition to see who can make the highest tower.
You'd be amazed how high they can go.
Right.
But they're learning all the time as well as having fun.
For example, one thing they do is to design and build a car that's attached to a balloon,
and the force of the air in that actually powers the car and makes it move along.
They go really fast too.
OK, well, all this sounds perfect.
Now Carly, that's my older daughter, has just had her seventh birthday,
so presumably she'd be in a different group?
Yes, she'd be in the Junior Engineers.
That's for children from six to eight.
And do they do the same sorts of activities?
Some are the same, but a bit more advanced.
So they work out how to build model vehicles,
things like cars and trucks,
but also how to construct animals using the same sorts of material and technique,
and then they learn how they can program them and make them move.
So they learn a bit of coding?
They do.
They pick it up really quickly.
We're there to help if they need it,
but they learn from one another too.
Right.
And do they have competitions too?
Yes, with the Junior Engineers,
it's to use recycled materials like card and wood to build a bridge,
and the longest one gets a prize.
That sounds fun.
I wouldn't mind doing that myself!
Then they have something a bit different,
which is to think up an idea for a five-minute movie and then film it,
using special animation software.
You'd be amazed what they come up with.
And of course, that's something they can put on their phone and take home to show all their friends.
Exactly.
And then they also build a robot in the shape of a human,
and they decorate it and program it so that it can move its arms and legs.
Perfect.
So, is it the same price as the Tiny Engineers?
It's just a bit more:
¬£50 for the five weeks.
And are the classes on a Monday, too?
They used to be,
but we found it didn't give our staff enough time to clear up after the first workshop,
so we moved them to Wednesdays.
The classes are held in the morning from ten to eleven.
OK.
That's better for me actually.
And what about the location?
Where exactly are the workshops held?
They're in building 10A,
there's a big sign on the door, you can't miss it,
and that's in Fradstone Industrial Estate.
Sorry?
Fradstone,
that's Fradstone
And that's in Grasford, isn't it?
Yes, up past the station.
And will I have any parking problems there?
No, there's always plenty available.
So would you like to enrol Lydia and Carly now?
OK.
So can I have...

1039,Cam16 - Test 1 - Part 2,B2,cam16---test-1---part-2,69,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Stevenson's,
one of the country's major manufacturers of metal goods.
Thank you for choosing us for your two weeks of work experience.
My name is Julia Simmons,
and since the beginning of this year I've been the managing director.
Stevenson's is quite an old company.
Like me, the founder, Ronald Stevenson, went into the steel industry when he left school,
that was in 1923.
He set up this company when he finished his apprenticeship, in 1926,
although he actually started making plans two years earlier, in 1924.
He was a very determined young man!
Stevenson's long-term plan was to manufacture components for the machine tools industry,
although in fact that never came about,
and for the automotive industry, that is, cars and lorries.
However, there was a delay of five years before that happened,
because shortly before the company went into production,
Stevenson was given the opportunity to make goods for hospitals
and other players in the healthcare industry,
so that's what we did for the first five years.
Over the years, we've expanded the premises considerably,
we were lucky that the site is big enough,
so moving to a new location has never been necessary.
However, the layout is far from ideal for modern machinery and production methods,
so we intend to carry out major refurbishment of this site over the next five years.
I'd better give you some idea of what you'll be doing during your two weeks with us,
so you know what to expect.
Most mornings you'll have a presentation from one of the managers,
to learn about their department, starting this morning with research and development.
And you'll all spend some time in each department,
observing what's going on and talking to people,
as long as you don't stop them from doing their work altogether!
In the past, a teacher from your school has come in at the end of each week
to find out how the group were getting on,
but your school isn't able to arrange that this year.
OK, now I'll briefly help you to orientate yourselves around the site.
As you can see, we're in the reception area,
which we try to make attractive and welcoming to visitors.
There's a corridor running left from here,
and if you go along that,
the door facing you at the end is the entrance to the coffee room.
This looks out onto the main road on one side, and some trees on the other,
and that'll be where you meet each morning.
The factory is the very big room on the far side of the site.
Next to it is the warehouse,
which can be accessed by lorries going up the road to the turning area at the end.
You can get to the warehouse by crossing to the far side of the courtyard,
and then the door is on your right.
Somewhere you'll be keen to find is the staff canteen.
This is right next to reception.
I can confidently say that the food's very good,
but the view isn't.
The windows on one side look onto a corridor and courtyard,
which aren't very attractive at all,
and on the other onto the access road, which isn't much better.
You'll be using the meeting room quite often,
and you'll find it by walking along the corridor to the left of the courtyard,
and continuing along it to the end.
The meeting room is the last one on the right,
and I'm afraid there's no natural daylight in the room.
Then you'll need to know where some of the offices are.
The human resources department is at the front of this building,
so you head to the left along the corridor from reception,
and it's the second room you come to.
It looks out onto the main road.
And finally, the boardroom, where you'll be meeting sometimes.
That has quite a pleasant view, as it looks out onto the trees.
Go along the corridor past the courtyard, right to the end.
The boardroom is on the left, next to the factory.
OK, now are there any questions...

1040,Cam16 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam16---test-1---part-3,82,"How are you getting on with your art project, Tom?
OK.
Like, they gave us the theme of birds to base our project on,
and I'm not really all that interested in wildlife.
But I'm starting to get into it.
I've pretty well finished the introductory stage.
So have I.
When they gave us all those handouts with details of books and websites to look at,
I was really put off,
but the more I read, the more interested I got.
Me too.
I found I could research so many different aspects of birds in art - colour, movement, texture.
So I was looking forward to the Bird Park visit.
What a letdown!
It poured with rain and we hardly saw a single bird.
Much less use than the trip to the Natural History Museum.
Yeah, I liked all the stuff about evolution there.
The workshop sessions with Dr Fletcher were good too,
especially the brainstorming sessions.
Oh... I missed those because I was ill.
I wish we could've seen the projects last year's students did.
Mm. I suppose they want us to do our own thing, not copy.
Have you drafted your proposal yet?
Yes, but I haven't handed it in.
I need to amend some parts.
I've realised the notes from my research are almost all just descriptions,
I haven't actually evaluated anything.
So I'll have to fix that.
Oh, I didn't know we had to do that.
I'll have to look at that too.
Did you do a timeline for the project?
Yes, and a mind map.
Yeah, so did I.
I quite enjoyed that.
But it was hard having to explain the basis for my decisions in my action plan.
What?
You know, give a rationale.
I didn't realise we had to do that.
OK, I can add it now.
And I've done the video diary presentation,
and worked out what I want my outcome to be in the project.
Someone told me it's best not to be too precise about your actual outcome at this stage,
so you have more scope to explore your ideas later on.
So I'm going to go back to my proposal to make it a bit more vague.
Really? OK, I'll change that too then.
One part of the project I'm unsure about is where we choose some paintings of birds and say what they mean to us.
Like, I chose a painting of a falcon by Landseer.
I like it because the bird's standing there with his head turned to one side,
but he seems to be staring straight at you.
But I can't just say it's a bit scary, can I?
You could talk about the possible danger suggested by the bird's look.
Oh, OK.
There's a picture of a fish hawk by Audubon I like.
It's swooping over the water with a fish in its talons,
and with great black wings which take up most of the picture.
So you could discuss it in relation to predators and food chains?
Well actually I think I'll concentrate on the impression of rapid motion it gives.
Right.
Do you know that picture of a kingfisher by van Gogh -
it's perching on a reed growing near a stream.
Yes, it's got these beautiful blue and red and black shades.
I've actually chosen it because I saw a real kingfisher once when I was little,
I was out walking with my grandfather, and I've never forgotten it.
So we can use a personal link?
Sure.
OK.
There's a portrait called William Wells.
I can't remember the artist but it's a middle-aged man who's just shot a bird.
And his expression, and the way he's holding the bird in his hand
suggests he's not sure about what he's done.
To me it's about how ambiguous people are in the way they exploit the natural world.
Interesting.
There's Gauguin's picture Vairumati.
He did it in Tahiti.
It's a woman with a white bird behind her that is eating a lizard,
and what I'm interested in is what idea this bird refers to.
Apparently, it's a reference to the never-ending cycle of existence.
Wow.
I chose a portrait of a little boy, Giovanni de Medici.
He's holding a tiny bird in one fist.
I like the way he's holding it carefully so he doesn't hurt it.
Ah right.

1041,Cam16 - Test 1 - Part 4,C1,cam16---test-1---part-4,67,"Ancient philosophy is not just about talking or lecturing,
or even reading long, dense books.
In fact, it is something people have used throughout history -
to solve their problems and to achieve their greatest triumphs.
Specifically, I am referring to Stoicism,
which, in my opinion, is the most practical of all philosophies
and therefore the most appealing.
Stoicism was founded in Ancient Greece by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC,
but was practised by the likes of Epictetus,
Cato, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.
Amazingly, we still have access to these ideas,
despite the fact that the most famous Stoics never wrote anything down for publication,
Cato definitely didn't.
Marcus Aurelius never intended his Meditations to be anything but personal.
Seneca's letters were, well, letters
and Epictetus' thoughts come to us by way of a note-taking student.
Stoic principles were based on the idea that its followers could have an unshakable happiness in this life
and the key to achieving this was virtue.
The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding that destructive emotions, like anger and jealousy,
are under our conscious control,
they don't have to control us, because we can learn to control them.
In the words of Epictetus:
‚Äúexternal events I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them, I do control‚Äù.
The modern day philosopher and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb
defines a Stoic as someone who has a different perspective on experiences
which most of us would see as wholly negative;
a Stoic ‚Äútransforms fear into caution, pain into transformation,
mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking‚Äù.
Using this definition as a model,
we can see that throughout the centuries Stoicism has been practised in more recent history
by kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs.
The founding fathers of the United States were inspired by the philosophy.
George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbours at age seventeen,
and later, put on a play based on the life of Cato to inspire his men.
Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed.
Writers and artists have also been inspired by the stoics.
Eug√®ne Delacroix, the renowned French Romantic artist
(known best for his painting Liberty Leading the People)
was an ardent Stoic, referring to it as his ‚Äúconsoling religion‚Äù.
The economist Adam Smith's theories on capitalism were significantly influenced by the Stoicism
that he studied as a schoolboy, under a teacher who had translated Marcus Aurelius' works.
Today's political leaders are no different,
with many finding their inspiration from the ancient texts.
Former US president Bill Clinton rereads Marcus Aurelius every single year,
and many have compared former President Obama's calm leadership style to that of Cato.
Wen Jiabao, the former prime minister of China,
claims that Meditations is one of two books he travels with
and that he has read it more than 100 times over the course of his life.
Stoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis,
who invented Cognitive Behaviour Therapy,
which is used to help people manage their problems by changing the way that they think and behave.
It's most commonly used to treat depression.
The idea is that we can take control of our lives by challenging the irrational beliefs
that create our faulty thinking, symptoms and behaviours by using logic instead.
Stoicism has also become popular in the world of business.
Stoic principles can build the resilience and state of mind required to overcome setbacks
because Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity.
A lesson every business entrepreneur needs to learn.
I would argue that studying Stoicism is as relevant today as it was 2,000 years ago,
thanks to its brilliant insights into how to lead a good life.
At the very root of the thinking, there is a very simple way of living -
control what you can and accept what you can't.
This is not as easy as it sounds and will require considerable practice -
it can take a lifetime to master.
The Stoics also believed the most important foundation for a good and happy life is not money, fame, power or pleasure,
but having a disciplined and principled character -
something which seems to resonate with many people today.

1042,Cam16 - Test 2 - Part 1,B1,cam16---test-2---part-1,74,"Hello, Picturerep. Can I help you?
Oh, hi.
I saw your advertisement about copying pictures to disk
and I'd like a bit more information about what you do.
Sure. What would you like to know?
Well, I've got a box full of old family photos that's been up in the attic for years,
some of them must be 50 or 60 years old,
and I'd like to get them converted to digital format.
Sure, we can do that for you.
Right.
And what about size?
The photos are all sorts of sizes - are there any restrictions?
Well the maximum size of photo we can do with our normal service is 30 centimetres.
And each picture must be at least 4 centimetres,
that's the minimum we can cope with.
That should be fine.
And some of them are in a frame,
should I take them out before I send them?
Yes please, we can't copy them otherwise.
And also the photos must all be separate,
they mustn't be stuck into an album.
OK, that's not a problem.
So can you give me an idea of how much this will cost?
I've got about 360 photos I think.
We charge ¬£195 for 300 to 400 photos for the basic service.
OK. And does that include the disk?
Yes, one disk.
But you can get extra ones for ¬£5 each.
That's good.
So do I need to pay when I send you the photos?
No, we won't need anything until we've actually copied the pictures.
Then we'll let you know how much it is,
and once we've received the payments, we'll send the parcel off to you.
Right.
Is there anything else you'd like to ask about our services?
Yes.
I've roughly sorted out the photos into groups, according to what they're about.
So can you keep them in those groups when you copy them?
Sure.
We'll save each group in a different folder on the disk and if you like, you can suggest a name for each folder.
So I could have one called 'Grandparents' for instance?
Exactly.
And do you do anything besides scan the photos?
Like, can you make any improvements?
Yes, in the standard service each photo is checked,
and we can sometimes touch up the colour a bit, or improve the contrast -
that can make a big difference.
OK.
And some of the photos are actually quite fragile -
they won't get damaged in the process, will they?
No, if any look particularly fragile, we'd do them by hand.
We do realise how precious these old photos can be.
Sure.
And another thing is we can make changes to a photo if you want -
so if you want to remove an object from a photo,
or maybe alter the background, we can do that.
Really?
I might be interested in that.
I'll have a look through the photos and see.
Oh, and talking of fixing photos -
I've got a few that aren't properly in focus.
Can you do anything to make that better?
No, I'm afraid that's one thing we can't do.
OK.
Any other information I can give you?
...oh, how long will it all take?
We aim to get the copying done in ten days.
Fine.
Right, well I'll get the photos packed up in a box and post them off to you.
Right. If you've got a strong cardboard box, that's best.
We've found that plastic ones sometimes break in the post.
OK.
Right, thanks for your help. Bye.
Bye.

1043,Cam16 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam16---test-2---part-2,70,"Good morning and thank you for coming here today.
I'd like to bring you up to date with changes in the school that will affect your children.
As you know, the school buildings date from various times:
some from the 1970s, some from the last five years,
and of course Dartfield House is over a century old.
It was commissioned by a businessman.
Neville Richards, and intended as his family home,
but he died before it was completed.
His heir chose to sell it to the local council, who turned it into offices.
A later plan to convert it into a tourist information centre didn't come about, through lack of money,
and instead it formed the nucleus of this school when it opened 40 years ago.
The school has grown as the local population has increased,
and I can now give you some news about the lower school site,
which is separated from the main site by a road.
Planning permission has been granted for development of both sites.
The lower school will move to new buildings that will be constructed on the main site.
Developers will construct houses on the existing lower school site.
Work on the new school buildings should start within the next few months.
A more imminent change concerns the catering facilities and the canteen.
The canteen is always very busy throughout the lunch period -
in fact it's often full to capacity,
because a lot of our pupils like the food that's on offer there.
But there's only one serving point,
so most pupils have to wait a considerable time to be served.
This is obviously unsatisfactory,
as they may have hardly finished their lunch before afternoon lessons start.
So we've had a new Food Hall built,
and this will come into use next week.
It'll have several serving areas,
and I'll give you more details about those in a minute,
but one thing we ask you to do, to help in the smooth running of the Food Hall,
is to discuss with your children each morning which type of food they want to eat that day,
so they can go straight to the relevant serving point.
There won't be any junk food - everything on offer will be healthy -
and there's no change to the current system of paying for lunches by topping up your child's electronic payment card online.
You may be wondering what will happen to the old canteen.
We'll still have tables and chairs in there,
and pupils can eat food from the Food Hall or lunch they've brought from home.
Eventually we may use part of the canteen for storage,
but first we'll see how many pupils go in there at lunchtime.
OK, back to the serving points in the Food Hall,
which will all have side dishes, desserts and drinks on sale,
as well as main courses.
One serving point we call World Adventures.
This will serve a different country's cuisine each day,
maybe Chinese one day and Lebanese the next.
The menus will be planned for a week at a time,
so pupils will know what's going to be available the whole of that week.
Street Life is also international, with food from three particular cultures.
We'll ask pupils to make suggestions,
so perhaps sometimes there'll be food from Thailand, Ethiopia and Mexico,
and then one of them will be replaced by Jamaican food for a week or two.
The Speedy Italian serving point will cater particularly for the many pupils who don't eat meat or fish:
they can be sure that all the food served there is suitable for them.
There'll be plenty of variety, so they shouldn't get bored with the food.
OK, that's all on the new Food Hall.
Now after-school lessons.
These are very popular with pupils, particularly swimming -
in fact there's a waiting list for lessons.
Cycling is another favourite,
and I'm delighted that dozens of pupils make use of the chance to learn to ride in off-road conditions.
It means that more and more cycle to and from school every day.
As you know, we have a well-equipped performance centre,
and we're going to start drama classes in there, too.
Pupils will be able to join in just for fun or work up to taking part in a play -
we hope to put on at least one a year.
We already teach a number of pupils to use the sound and lighting systems in the centre.
And a former pupil has given a magnificent grand piano to the school,
so a few pupils will be able to learn at the school
instead of going to the local college, as many of them do at the moment.

1044,Cam16 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam16---test-2---part-3,85,"So Luke, for our next psychology assignment we have to do something on sleep and dreams.
Right.
I've just read an article suggesting why we tend to forget most of our dreams soon after we wake up.
I mean, most of my dreams aren't that interesting anyway,
but what it said was that if we remembered everything,
we might get mixed up about what actually happened and what we dreamed.
So it's a sort of protection.
I hadn't heard that idea before.
I'd always assumed that it was just that we didn't have room in our memories for all that stuff.
Me too.
What do you think about the idea that our dreams may predict the future?
It's a belief that you get all over the world.
Yeah, lots of people have a story of it happening to them,
but the explanation I've read is that for each dream that comes true,
we have thousands that don't, but we don't notice those,
we don't even remember them.
We just remember the ones where something in the real world,
like a view or an action, happens to trigger a dream memory.
Right.
So it's just a coincidence really.
Something else I read about is what they call segmented sleeping.
That's a theory that hundreds of years ago,
people used to get up in the middle of the night and have a chat or something to eat,
then go back to bed.
So I tried it myself.
Why?
Well it's meant to make you more creative.
I don't know why.
But I gave it up after a week.
It just didn't fit in with my lifestyle.
But most pre-school children have a short sleep in the day don't they?
There was an experiment some students did here last term to see at what age kids should stop having naps.
But they didn't really find an answer.
They spent a lot of time working out the most appropriate methodology,
but the results didn't seem to show any obvious patterns.
Right.
Anyway, let's think about our assignment.
Last time I had problems with the final stage,
where we had to describe and justify how successful we thought we'd been.
I struggled a bit with the action plan too.
I was OK with the planning,
but I got marked down for the self-assessment as well.
And I had big problems with the statistical stuff,
that's where I really lost marks.
Right.
So shall we plan what we have to do for this assignment?
OK.
First, we have to decide on our research question.
So how about 'Is there a relationship between hours of sleep and number of dreams?'
OK.
Then we need to think about who we'll do the study on.
About 12 people?
Right.
And shall we use other psychology students?
Let's use people from a different department.
What about history?
Yes, they might have interesting dreams!
Or literature students?
I don't really know any.
OK, forget that idea.
Then we have to think about our methodology.
So we could use observation,
but that doesn't seem appropriate.
No.
it needs to be self-reporting I think.
And we could ask them to answer questions online.
But in this case, paper might be better
as they'll be doing it straight after they wake up...
in fact while they're still half-asleep.
Right.
And we'll have to check the ethical guidelines for this sort of research.
Because our experiment involves humans, so there are special regulations.
Yes,
I had a look at those for another assignment I did.
There's a whole section on risk assessment,
and another section on making sure they aren't put under any unnecessary stress.
Let's hope they don't have any bad dreams!
Yeah.
Then when we've collected all our data we have to analyse it
and calculate the correlation between our two variables,
that's time sleeping and number of dreams
and then present our results visually in a graph.
Right. And the final thing is to think about our research and evaluate it.
So that seems quite straightforward.
Yeah. So now let's...

1045,Cam16 - Test 2 - Part 4,B2,cam16---test-2---part-4,72,"Dancing is something that humans do when they want to have a good time.
It's a universal response to music, found in all cultures.
But what's only been discovered recently is that dancing not only makes us feel good,
it's also extremely good for our health.
Dancing, like other forms of exercise, releases hormones, such as dopamine,
which make us feel relaxed and happy.
And it also reduces feelings of stress or anxiety.
Dancing is also a sociable activity,
which is another reason it makes us feel good.
One study compared people's enjoyment of dancing at home in front of a video with dancing in a group in a studio.
The people dancing in a group reported feeling happier,
whereas those dancing alone did not.
In another experiment, university researchers at York and Sheffield
took a group of students and sent each of them into a lab where music was played for five minutes.
Each had to choose from three options:
to sit and listen quietly to the music,
to cycle on an exercise bike while they listened,
or to get up and dance.
All were given cognitive tasks to perform before and after.
The result showed that those who chose to dance showed much more creativity when doing problem-solving tasks.
Doctor Lovatt at the University of Hertfordshire
believes dance could be a very useful way to help people suffering from mental health problems.
He thinks dance should be prescribed as therapy
to help people overcome issues such as depression.
It's well established that dance is a good way of encouraging adolescent girls to take exercise
but what about older people?
Studies have shown that there are enormous benefits for people in their 60s and beyond.
One of the great things about dance is that there are no barriers to participation.
Anyone can have a go,
even those whose standard of fitness is quite low.
Dance can be especially beneficial for older adults
who can't run or do more intense workouts,
or for those who don't want to.
One 2015 study found that even a gentle dance workout helps to promote a healthy heart.
And there's plenty of evidence which suggests that dancing lowers the risk of falls,
which could result in a broken hip, for example, by helping people to improve their balance.
There are some less obvious benefits of dance for older people too.
One thing I hadn't realised before researching this topic
was that dance isn't just a physical challenge.
It also requires a lot of concentration
because you need to remember different steps and routines.
For older people, this kind of activity is especially important
because it forces their brain to process things more quickly
and to retain more information.
Current research also shows that dance promotes a general sense of well-being in older participants,
which can last up to a week after a class.
Participants report feeling less tired and having greater motivation to be more active
and do daily activities such as gardening or walking to the shops or a park.
Ballroom or country dancing, both popular with older people, have to be done in groups.
They require collaboration and often involve touching a dance partner,
all of which encourages interaction on the dance floor.
This helps to develop new relationships
and can reduce older people's sense of isolation,
which is a huge problem in many countries.
I also looked at the benefits of Zumba.
Fifteen million people in 180 countries now regularly take a Zumba class,
an aerobic workout based on Latin American dance moves.
John Porcari, a professor of exercise and sport science at the University of Wisconsin,
analysed a group of women who were Zumba regulars
and found that a class lasting 40 minutes burns about 370 calories.
This is similar to moderately intense exercises like step aerobics or kickboxing.
A study in the American Journal of Health Behavior
showed that when women with obesity did Zumba three times a week for 16 weeks,
they lost an average of 1.2 kilos
and lowered their percentage of body fat by 1%.
More importantly, the women enjoyed the class so much
that they made it a habit and continued to attend classes at least once a week -
very unusual for an aerobic exercise programme.
Dance is never going to compete with high-intensity workouts
when it comes to physical fitness gains,
but its popularity is likely to keep on rising
because it's such a fun way to keep fit.

1046,Cam16 - Test 3 - Part 1,B1,cam16---test-3---part-1,84,"Hello, Junior Cycle camp, Jake speaking.
Hi.
I'm calling for some information about the cycle camp -
I'm thinking of sending my son.
Great.
Well, it's held every weekday morning over the summer vacation
and we focus on basic cycling skills and safety.
We have eight levels for children from three years upwards.
How old's your son?
Charlie? He's seven.
He can ride a bike,
but he needs a little more training before he's safe to go on the road.
He'd probably be best in Level 5.
They start off practising on the site here,
and we aim to get them riding on the road,
but first they're taken to ride in the park, away from the traffic.
Right.
And can you tell me a bit about the instructors?
Well, all our staff wear different coloured shirts.
So, we have three supervisors, and they have red shirts.
They support the instructors,
and they also stand in for me if I'm not around.
Then the instructors themselves are in blue shirts,
and one of these is responsible for each class.
OK.
In order to be accepted,
all our instructors have to submit a reference from someone who's seen them work with children -
like if they've worked as a babysitter, for example.
Then they have to complete our training course,
including how to do lesson plans,
and generally care for the well-being of the kids in their class.
They do a great job, I have to say.
Right.
And tell me a bit about the classes.
What size will Charlie's class be?
We have a limit of eight children in each class,
so their instructor really gets to know them well.
They're out riding most of the time
but they have quiet times too,
where their instructor might tell them a story that's got something to do with cycling,
or get them to play a game together.
It's a lot of fun.
It must be.
Now, what happens if there's rain?
Do the classes still run?
Oh yes.
We don't let that put us off -
we just put on our waterproofs and keep cycling.
And is there anything special Charlie should bring along with him?
Well, maybe some spare clothes,
especially if the weather's not so good.
And a snack for break time.
How about a drink?
No, we'll provide that.
And make sure he has shoes, not sandals.
Sure.
And just at present Charlie has to take medication every few hours,
so I'll make sure he has that.
Absolutely.
Just give us details of when he has to take it
and we'll make sure he does.
Thanks.
Now, there are a few things you should know about Day 1 of the camp.
The classes normally start at 9:30 every morning,
but on Day 1, you should aim to get Charlie here by 9:20.
The finishing time will be 12:30 as usual.
We need the additional time because there are a few extra things to do.
The most important is that we have a very careful check to make sure that every child's helmet fits properly.
If it doesn't fit, we'll try to adjust it,
or we'll find him another one -
but he must wear it all the time he's on the bike.
Of course.
Then after that, all the instructors will be waiting to meet their classes,
and they'll meet up in the tent -
you can't miss it.
And each instructor will take their class away and get started.
OK. Well that all sounds good.
Now, can you tell me how much the camp costs a week?
$199.
We've managed to keep the price more or less the same as last year -
it was 190 then.
But the places are filling up quite quickly.
Right.
OK, well I'd like to book for...

1047,Cam16 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam16---test-3---part-2,65,"Hello everyone.
My name's Megan Baker
and I'm a recruitment consultant at AVT Recruitment specialists.
Now, our company specialises in positions that involve working in the agriculture and horticulture sectors,
so that's fresh food production, garden and park maintenance and so on.
And these sectors do provide some very special career opportunities.
For a start, they often offer opportunities for those who don't want to be stuck with a 40-hour week,
but need to juggle work with other responsibilities such as child care -
and this is very important for many of our recruits.
Some people like working in a rural setting,
surrounded by plants and trees instead of buildings,
although we can't guarantee that.
But there are certainly health benefits,
especially in jobs where you're not sitting all day looking at a screen -
a big plus for many people.
Salaries can sometimes be good too,
although there's a lot of variety here.
And you may have the opportunity in some types of jobs for travel overseas,
although that obviously depends on the job,
and not everyone is keen to do it.
Of course, working outdoors does have its challenges.
It's fine in summer, but can be extremely unpleasant when it's cold and windy.
You may need to be pretty fit for some jobs,
though with modern technology that's not as important as it once was.
And standards of health and safety are much higher now than they used to be,
so there are fewer work-related accidents.
But if you like a lively city environment surrounded by lots of people,
these jobs are probably not for you -
they're often in pretty remote areas.
And some people worry about finding a suitable place to live,
but in our experience, this usually turns out fine.
Now let me tell you about some of the exciting jobs that we have on our books right now.
One is for a fresh food commercial manager.
Our client here is a very large fresh food producer supplying a range of top supermarkets.
They operate in a very fast-paced environment with low profit margins -
the staff there work hard,
but they play hard as well,
so if you've a sociable personality this may be for you.
We have an exciting post as an agronomist advising farmers on issues such as crop nutrition,
protection against pests,
and the latest legislation on farming and agricultural practices.
There are good opportunities for the right person to quickly make their way up the career ladder,
but a deep knowledge of the agricultural sector is expected of applicants.
A leading supermarket is looking for a fresh produce buyer
who is available for a 12-month maternity cover contract.
You need to have experience in administration,
planning and buying in the fresh produce industry,
and in return will receive a very competitive salary.
We've also received a request for a sales manager for a chain of garden centres.
You will be visiting centres in the region
to ensure their high levels of customer service are maintained.
This post is only suitable for someone who is prepared to live in the region.
There is also a vacancy for a tree technician to carry out tree cutting,
forestry and conservation work.
Candidates must have a clean driving licence
and have training in safety procedures.
A year's experience would be preferred
but the company might be prepared to consider someone who has just completed an appropriate training course.
Finally, we have a position for a farm worker.
This will involve a wide range of farm duties
including crop sowing and harvesting,
machine maintenance and animal care.
Perks of the job include the possibility of renting a small cottage on the estate,
and the chance to earn a competitive salary.
A driving licence and tractor driving experience are essential.

1048,Cam16 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam16---test-3---part-3,68,"OK Rosie, shall we try to get some ideas together for our presentation on diet and obesity?
Sure.
I can talk about the experiment I did to see if people can tell the difference between real sugar and artificial sweeteners.
Where you gave people drinks with either sugar or artificial sweeteners
and they had to say which they thought it was?
Yeah. It took me ages to decide exactly how I'd organise it,
especially how I could make sure that people didn't know which drink I was giving them.
It was hard to keep track of it all,
especially as I had so many people doing it -
I had to make sure I kept a proper record of what each person had had.
So could most people tell the difference?
Yeah - I hadn't thought that they would be able to, but most people could.
Then there's that experiment I did measuring the fat content of nuts,
to see if the nutritional information given on the packet was accurate.
The one where you ground up the nuts and mixed them with a chemical to absorb the fat?
Yes.
My results were a bit problematic -
the fat content for that type of nut seemed much lower than it said on the package.
But I reckon the package information was right.
I think I should probably have ground up the nuts more than I did.
It's possible that the scales for weighing the fat weren't accurate enough, too.
I'd really like to try the experiment again some time.
So what can we say about helping people to lose weight?
There's a lot we could say about what restaurants could do to reduce obesity.
I read that the items at the start of a menu and the items at the end of a menu
are much more likely to be chosen than the items in the middle.
So, if you put the low-calorie items at the beginning and end of the menu,
people will probably go for the food with fewer calories, without even realising what they're doing.
I think food manufacturers could do more to encourage healthy eating.
How?
Well, when manufacturers put calorie counts of a food on the label,
they're sometimes really confusing and I suspect they do it on purpose.
Because food that's high in calories tastes better, and so they'll sell more.
Yeah, so if you look at the amount of calories in a pizza,
they'll give you the calories per quarter pizza and you think, oh that's not too bad.
But who's going to eat a quarter pizza?
Exactly.
I suppose another approach to this problem is to get people to exercise more.
Right.
In England, the current guidelines are for at least 30 minutes of brisk walking, five days a week.
Now when you ask them, about 40% of men
and 30% of women say they do this,
but when you objectively measure the amount of walking they do with motion sensors,
you find that only 6% of men and 4% of women do the recommended amount of exercise.
So you can see why obesity is growing.
So how can people be encouraged to take more exercise?
Well, for example, think of the location of stairs in a train station.
if people reach the stairs before they reach the escalator when they're leaving the station,
they're more likely to take the stairs.
And if you increase the width of the stairs,
you'll get more people using them at the same time.
It's an unconscious process and influenced by minor modifications in their environment.
Right.
And it might not be a big change,
but if it happens every day, it all adds up.
Yes.
But actually, I'm not sure if we should be talking about exercise in our presentation.
Well, we've done quite a bit of reading about it.
I know, but it's going to mean we have a very wide focus,
and our tutor did say that we need to focus on causes and solutions in terms of nutrition.
Oh, I suppose so.
And we've got plenty of information about that.
OK, well that will be simpler.
So what shall we do now?
We've still got half an hour before our next lecture.
Let's think about what we're going to include and what will go where.
Then we can decide what slides we need.

1049,Cam16 - Test 3 - Part 4,B2,cam16---test-3---part-4,77,"Good morning everyone.
So today we're going to look at an important creative activity
and that's hand knitting.
Ancient knitted garments have been found in many different countries,
showing that knitting is a global activity with a long history.
When someone says the word 'knitting'
we might well picture an elderly person -
a grandmother perhaps -
sitting by the fire knitting garments for themselves or other members of the family.
It's a homely image,
but one that may lead you to feel that knitting is an activity of the past -
and, indeed, during the previous decade,
it was one of the skills that was predicted to vanish from everyday life.
For although humans have sewn and knitted their own clothing for a very long time,
many of these craft-based skills went into decline
when industrial machines took over -
mainly because they were no longer passed down from one generation to another.
However, that's all changing
and interest in knitting classes in many countries is actually rising,
as more and more people are seeking formal instruction in the skill.
With that trend, we're also seeing an increase in the sales figures for knitting equipment.
So why do people want to be taught to knit
at a time when a machine can readily do the job for them?
The answer is that knitting, as a handicraft,
has numerous benefits for those doing it.
Let's consider what some of these might be.
While many people knitted garments in the past
because they couldn't afford to buy clothes,
it's still true today that knitting can be helpful
if you're experiencing economic hardship.
If you have several children who all need warm winter clothes,
knitting may save you a lot of money.
And the results of knitting your own clothes can be very rewarding,
even though the skills you need to get going are really quite basic
and the financial outlay is minimal.
But the more significant benefits in today's world are to do with well-being.
In a world where it's estimated that we spend up to nine hours a day online,
doing something with our hands that is craft-based makes us feel good.
It releases us from the stress of a technological, fast-paced life.
Now, let's look back a bit to early knitting activities.
In fact, no one really knows when knitting first began,
but archaeological remains have disclosed plenty of information for us to think about.
One of the interesting things about knitting
is that the earliest pieces of clothing that have been found
suggest that most of the items produced were round rather than flat.
Discoveries from the 3rd and 4th centuries in Egypt
show that things like socks and gloves,
that were needed to keep hands and feet warm,
were knitted in one piece using four or five needles.
That's very different from most knitting patterns today,
which only require two.
What's more, the very first needles people used were hand carved out of wood
and other natural materials, like bone,
whereas today's needles are largely made of steel or plastic
and make that characteristic clicking sound when someone's using them.
Ancient people knitted using yarns made from linen,
hemp, cotton and wool,
and these were often very rough on the skin.
The spinning wheel, which allowed people to make finer yarns
and produce much greater quantities of them,
led to the dominance of wool in the knitting industry -
often favoured for its warmth.
Another interesting fact about knitting
is that because it was practised in so many parts of the world
for so many purposes,
regional differences in style developed.
This visual identity has allowed researchers to match bits of knitted clothing
that have been unearthed over time to the region from which the wearer came
or the job that he or she did.
As I've mentioned,
knitting offered people from poor communities a way of making extra money
while doing other tasks.
For many centuries, it seems,
men, women and children took every opportunity to knit,
for example, while watching over sheep,
walking to market or riding in boats.
So, let's move on...

1050,Cam16 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam16---test-4---part-1,90,"Hello?
Oh hello.
I was hoping to speak to Jack Fitzgerald about renting a cottage.
I'm his wife, Shirley, and we own the cottages together,
so I'm sure I can help you.
Great.
My name's Tom.
Some friends of ours rented Granary Cottage from you last year,
and they thought it was great.
So my wife and I are hoping to come in May for a week.
What date did you have in mind?
The week beginning the 14th, if possible.
I'll just check...
I'm sorry, Tom, it's already booked that week.
It's free the week beginning the 28th, though, for seven nights.
In fact, that's the only time you could have it in May.
Well, we could manage that, I think.
We'd just need to change a couple of things.
How much would it cost?
That's the beginning of high season,
so it'd be ¬£550 for the week.
That's a bit more than we wanted to pay, I'm afraid.
We've budgeted up to ¬£500 for accommodation.
Well, we've just finished converting another building into a cottage,
which we're calling Chervil Cottage.
Sorry? What was that again?
Chervil.
C H E R V for Victor I L.
Oh, that's a herb, isn't it?
That's right.
It grows fairly wild around here.
You could have that for the week you want for ¬£480.
OK.
So could you tell me something about it, please?
Of course.
The building was built as a garage.
It's a little smaller than Granary Cottage.
So that must sleep two people, as well?
That's right.
There's a double bedroom.
Does it have a garden?
Yes, you get to it from the living room through French doors,
and we provide two deckchairs.
We hope to build a patio in the near future,
but I wouldn't like to guarantee it'll be finished by May.
OK.
The front door opens onto the old farmyard,
and parking isn't a problem -
there's plenty of room at the front for that.
There are some trees and potted plants there.
What about facilities in the cottage?
It has standard things like a cooker and fridge, I presume.
In the kitchen area there's a fridge-freezer
and we've just put in an electric cooker.
Is there a washing machine?
Yes.
There's also a TV in the living room, which plays DVDs too.
The bathroom is too small for a bath,
so there's a shower instead.
I think a lot of people prefer that nowadays, anyway.
It's more environmentally friendly, isn't it?
Unless you spend half the day in it!
Exactly.
What about heating?
It sometimes gets quite cool at that time of year.
There's central heating, and if you want to light a fire, there's a stove.
We can provide all the wood you need for it.
It smells so much nicer than coal,
and it makes the room very cosy -
we've got one in our own house.
That sounds very pleasant.
Perhaps we should come in the winter, to make the most of it!
Yes, we find we don't want to go out when we've got the fire burning.
There are some attractive views from the cottage, which I haven't mentioned.
There's a famous stone bridge -
it's one of the oldest in the region,
and you can see it from the living room.
It isn't far away.
The bedroom window looks in the opposite direction,
and has a lovely view of the hills and the monument at the top.
Well, that all sounds perfect.
I'd like to book it, please.
Would you want a deposit?
Yes, we ask for 30% to secure your booking,
so that'll be... ¬£144.
And when would you like the rest of the money?
You're coming in May, so the last day of March, please.
Fine.
Excellent.
Could I just take your details...

1051,Cam16 - Test 4 - Part 2,B2,cam16---test-4---part-2,68,"Right. Next on the agenda we have traffic and highways.
Councillor Thornton.
Thank you.
Well, we now have the results of the survey carried out last month
about traffic and road transport in the town.
People were generally satisfied with the state of the roads.
There were one or two complaints about potholes which will be addressed,
but a significant number of people complained about the increasing number of heavy vehicles
using our local roads to avoid traffic elsewhere.
We'd expected more complaints by commuters
about the reduction in the train service,
but it doesn't seem to have affected people too much.
The cycle path that runs alongside the river
is very well used by both cyclists and pedestrians
since the surface was improved last year,
but overtaking can be a problem
so we're going to add a bit on the side to make it wider.
At some stage, we'd like to extend the path so that it goes all the way through the town,
but that won't be happening in the immediate future.
The plans to have a pedestrian crossing next to the Post Office
have unfortunately had to be put on hold for the time being.
We'd budgeted for this to be done this financial year,
but then there were rumours that the Post Office was going to move,
which would have meant there wasn't really a need for a crossing.
Now they've confirmed that they're staying where they are,
but the Highways Department have told us that it would be dangerous to have a pedestrian crossing
where we'd originally planned it as there's a bend in the road there.
So that'll need some more thought.
On Station Road near the station and level crossing,
drivers can face quite long waits if the level crossing's closed,
and we've now got signs up requesting them not to leave their engines running at that time.
This means pedestrians waiting on the pavement to cross the railway line
don't have to breathe in car fumes.
We've had some problems with cyclists leaving their bikes chained to the railings outside the ticket office,
but the station has agreed to provide bike racks there.
So next on the agenda is 'Proposals for improvements to the recreation ground'.
Councillor Thornton again.
Well, since we managed to extend the recreation ground,
we've spent some time talking to local people
about how it could be made a more attractive and useful space.
If you have a look at the map up on the screen,
you can see the river up in the north,
and the Community Hall near the entrance from the road.
At present, cars can park between the Community Hall and that line of trees to the east,
but this is quite dangerous for pedestrians
so we're suggesting a new car park on the opposite side of the Community Hall,
right next to it.
We also have a new location for the cricket pitch.
As we've now purchased additional space to the east of the recreation ground,
beyond the trees,
we plan to move it away from its current location,
which is rather near the road, into this new area beyond the line of trees.
This means there's less danger of stray balls hitting cars or pedestrians.
We've got plans for a children's playground
which will be accessible by a footpath from the Community Hall
and will be alongside the river.
We'd originally thought of having it close to the road,
but we think this will be a more attractive location.
The skateboard ramp is very popular with both younger and older children -
we had considered moving this up towards the river,
but in the end we decided to have it in the southeast corner near the road.
The pavilion is very well used at present by both football players and cricketers.
It will stay where it is now -
to the left of the line of trees and near to the river -
handy for both the football and cricket pitches.
And finally, we'll be getting a new notice board for local information,
and that will be directly on people's right
as they go from the road into the recreation ground.

1052,Cam16 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam16---test-4---part-3,93,"Now that we've done all the research into bike-sharing schemes in cities around the world,
we need to think about how we're going to organise our report.
Right.
I think we should start by talking about the benefits.
I mean it's great that so many cities have introduced these schemes
where anyone can pick up a bike from dozens of different locations
and hire it for a few hours.
It makes riding a bike very convenient for people.
Yes, but the costs can add up
and that puts people on low incomes off in some places.
I suppose so,
but if it means more people in general are cycling rather than driving,
then because they're increasing the amount of physical activity they do,
it's good for their health
OK.
But isn't that of less importance?
I mean, doesn't the impact of reduced emissions on air pollution
have a more significant effect on people's health?
Certainly, in some cities bike-sharing has made a big contribution to that.
And also helped to cut the number of cars on the road significantly.
Which is the main point.
Exactly.
But I'd say it's had less of an impact on noise pollution
because there are still loads of buses and lorries around.
Right.
Shall we quickly discuss the recommendations we're going to make?
In order to ensure bike-sharing schemes are successful?
Yes.
OK.
Well, while I think it's nice to have really state-of-the-art bikes with things like GPS,
I wouldn't say they're absolutely necessary.
But some technical things are really important -
like a fully functional app -
so people can make payments and book bikes easily.
Places which haven't invested in that have really struggled.
Good point...
Some people say there shouldn't be competing companies offering separate bike-sharing schemes,
but in some really big cities, competition's beneficial
and anyway one company might not be able to manage the whole thing.
Right.
Deciding how much to invest is a big question.
Cities which have opened loads of new bike lanes
at the same time as introducing bike-sharing schemes have generally been more successful -
but there are examples of successful schemes where this hasn't happened...
What does matter though - is having a big publicity campaign.
Definitely.
If people don't know how to use the scheme or don't understand its benefits,
they won't use it.
People need a lot of persuasion to stop using their cars.
Shall we look at some examples now?
And say what we think is good or bad about them.
I suppose we should start with Amsterdam
as this was one of the first cities to have a bike-sharing scheme.
Yes.
There was already a strong culture of cycling here.
In a way it's strange that there was such a demand for bike-sharing
because you'd have thought most people would have used their own bikes.
And yet it's one of the best-used schemes...
Dublin's an interesting example of a success story.
It must be because the public transport system's quite limited.
Not really -
there's no underground, but there are trams and a good bus network.
I'd say price has a lot to do with it.
It's one of the cheapest schemes in Europe to join.
But the buses are really slow -
anyway the weather certainly can't be a factor!
No - definitely not.
The London scheme's been quite successful
Yes - it's been a really good thing for the city.
The bikes are popular and the whole system is well maintained
but it isn't expanding quickly enough.
Basically, not enough's been spent on increasing the number of cycle lanes.
Hopefully that'll change.
Yes.
Now what about outside Europe?
Well bike-sharing schemes have taken off in places like Buenos Aires.
They built a huge network of cycle lanes to support the introduction of the scheme there, didn't they?
It attracted huge numbers of cyclists where previously there were hardly any.
An example of good planning.
Absolutely.
New York is a good example of how not to introduce a scheme.
When they launched it,
it was more than ten times the price of most other schemes.
More than it costs to take a taxi, crazy.
I think the organisers lacked vision and ambition there.
I think so too.
Sydney would be a good example to use.
I would have expected it to have grown pretty quickly here.
Yes.
I can't quite work out why it hasn't been an instant success like some of the others.
It's a shame really.
I know.
OK so now we've thought about...

1053,Cam16 - Test 4 - Part 4,C1,cam16---test-4---part-4,90,"One of the most famous cases of extinction is that of a bird known as the dodo.
In fact there's even a saying in English, 'as dead as the dodo',
used to refer to something which no longer exists.
But for many centuries the dodo was alive and well,
although it could only be found in one place,
the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.
It was a very large bird, about one metre tall,
and over the centuries it had lost the ability to fly,
but it survived happily under the trees that covered the island.
Then in the year 1507,
the first Portuguese ships stopped at the island.
The sailors were carrying spices back to Europe,
and found the island a convenient stopping place
where they could stock up with food and water for the rest of the voyage,
but they didn't settle on Mauritius.
However, in 1638
the Dutch arrived and set up a colony there.
These first human inhabitants of the island
found the dodo birds a convenient source of meat,
although not everyone liked the taste.
It's hard to get an accurate description of what the dodo actually looked like.
We do have some written records from sailors,
and a few pictures,
but we don't know how reliable these are.
The best-known picture is a Dutch painting,
in which the bird appears to be extremely fat,
but this may not be accurate -
an Indian painting done at the same time shows a much thinner bird.
Although attempts were made to preserve the bodies of some of the birds,
no complete specimen survives.
In the early 17th century
four dried parts of a bird were known to exist -
of these, three have disappeared,
so only one example of soft tissue from the dodo survives,
a dodo head.
Bones have also been found,
but there's only one complete skeleton in existence.
This single dodo skeleton has recently been the subject of scientific research
which suggests that many of the earlier beliefs about dodos
may have been incorrect.
For example,
early accounts of the birds mention how slow and clumsy it was,
but scientists now believe
the bird's strong knee joints would have made it capable of movement which was not slow,
but actually quite fast.
In fact, one 17th century sailor wrote that he found the birds hard to catch.
It's true that the dodo's small wings wouldn't have allowed it to leave the ground,
but the scientists suggest that these were probably employed for balance
while going over uneven ground.
Another group of scientists carried out analysis of the dodo's skull.
They found that the reports of the lack of intelligence of the dodo
were not borne out by their research,
which suggested the bird's brain was not small,
but average in size.
In fact, in relation to its body size,
it was similar to that of the pigeon,
which is known to be a highly intelligent bird.
The researchers also found that the structure of the bird's skull
suggested that one sense which was particularly well-developed was that of smell.
So the dodo may also have been particularly good at locating ripe fruit
and other food in the island's thick vegetation.
So it looks as if the dodo was better able to survive and defend itself than was originally believed.
Yet less than 200 years after Europeans first arrived on the island,
they had become extinct.
So what was the reason for this?
For a long time, it was believed that the dodos were hunted to extinction,
but scientists now believe the situation was more complicated than this.
Another factor may have been the new species brought to the island by the sailors.
These included dogs, which would have been a threat to the dodos,
and also monkeys,
which ate the fruit that was the main part of the dodos' diet.
These were brought to the island deliberately,
but the ships also brought another type of creature - rats,
which came to land from the ships and rapidly overran the island.
These upset the ecology of the island,
not just the dodos but other species too.
However,
they were a particular danger to the dodos
because they consumed their eggs,
and since each dodo only laid one at a time,
this probably had a devastating effect on populations.
However,
we now think that probably the main cause of the birds' extinction
was not the introduction of non-native species,
but the introduction of agriculture.
This meant that the forest that had once covered all the island,
and that had provided a perfect home for the dodo,
was cut down so that crops such as sugar could be grown.
So although the dodo had survived for thousands of years,
suddenly it was gone.

1054,Cam15 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam15---test-1---part-1,79,"Hello William.
This is Amber -
you said to phone if I wanted to get more information about the job agency you mentioned.
Is now a good time?
Oh, hi Amber. Yes. Fine.
So the agency I was talking about is called Bankside -
they're based in Docklands -
I can tell you the address now - 497 Eastside.
OK, thanks.
So is there anyone in particular I should speak to there?
The agent I always deal with is called Becky Jamieson.
Let me write that down -
Becky‚Ä¶
Jamieson
Jamieson
Do you have her direct line?
Yes, it's in my contacts somewhere -
right, here we are:
07866510333.
I wouldn't call her until the afternoon if I were you -
she's always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies.
She's really helpful and friendly so I'm sure it would be worth getting in touch with her for an informal chat.
It's mainly clerical and admin jobs they deal with, isn't it?
That's right.
I know you're hoping to find a full-time job in the media eventually -
but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff for the finance sector -
which will look good on your CV - and generally pays better too.
Yeah - I'm just a bit worried because I don't have much office experience.
I wouldn't worry.
They'll probably start you as a receptionist, or something like that.
So what's important for that kind of job isn't so much having business skills or
knowing lots of different computer systems - it's communication that really matters -
so you'd be fine there.
And you'll pick up office skills really quickly on the job.
It's not that complicated.
OK good.
So how long do people generally need temporary staff for?
It would be great if I could get something lasting at least a month.
That shouldn't be too difficult.
But you're more likely to be offered something for a week at first, which might get extended.
It's unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.
Right,
I've heard the pay isn't too bad -
better than working in a shop or a restaurant.
Oh yes - definitely.
The hourly rate is about ¬£10, 11 if you're lucky.
That's pretty good.
I was only expecting to get eight or nine pounds an hour.
Do you want me to tell you anything about the registration process?
Yes, please.
I know you have to have an interview.
The interview usually takes about an hour
and you should arrange that about a week in advance.
I suppose I should dress smartly if it's for office work -
I can probably borrow a suit from Mum.
Good idea.
It's better to look too smart than too casual.
Will I need to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that?
No - they don't need to see those, I don't think.
What about my passport?
Oh yes - they will ask to see that.
OK.
I wouldn't get stressed about the interview though.
It's just a chance for them to build relationship with you -
so they can try and match you to a job which you'll like.
So there are questions about personality that they always ask candidates -
fairly basic ones.
And they probably won't ask anything too difficult like what your plans are for the future.
Hope not.
Anyway, there are lots of benefits to using an agency -
for example, the interview will be useful because they'll give you feedback on your performance
so you can improve next time.
And they'll have access to jobs which aren't advertised.
Exactly -
most temporary jobs aren't advertised.
And I expect finding a temporary job this way takes a lot less time -
it's much easier than ringing up individual companies.
Yes indeed.
Well I think‚Ä¶

1055,Cam15 - Test 1 - Part 2,B2,cam15---test-1---part-2,72,"Good morning.
My name's Erica Matthews,
and I'm the owner of Matthews Island Holidays,
a company set up by my parents.
Thank you for coming to this presentation,
in which I hope to interest you in what we have to offer.
We're a small, family-run company,
and we believe in the importance of the personal touch,
so we don't aim to compete with other companies on the number of customers.
What we do is build on our many years' experience -
more than almost any other rail holiday company -
to ensure we provide perfect holidays in a small number of destinations,
which we've got to know extremely well.
I'll start with our six-day Isle of Man holiday.
This is a fascinating island in the Irish Sea,
with Wales to the south, England to the east,
Scotland to the north and Northern Ireland to the west.
Our holiday starts in Heysham,
where your tour manager will meet you,
then you'll travel by ferry to the Isle of Man.
Some people prefer to fly from Luton instead,
and another popular option is to go by train to Liverpool and take a ferry from there.
You have five nights in the hotel,
and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners,
and lunch on the three days when there are organised trips:
day four is free,
and most people have lunch in a caf√© or restaurant in Douglas.
The price of the holiday includes the ferry to the Isle of Man,
all travel on the island, the hotel, and the meals I've mentioned.
Incidentally, we try to make booking our holidays as simple and fair as possible,
so unlike with many companies,
the price is the same whether you book six months in advance
or at the last minute,
and there's no supplement for single rooms in hotels.
If you make a booking then need to change the start date,
for example because of illness,
you're welcome to change to an alternative date or a different tour,
for a small administrative fee.
OK, so what does the holiday consist of?
Well, on day one
you'll arrive in time for a short introduction by your tour manager,
followed by dinner in the hotel.
The dining room looks out at the river,
close to where it flows into the harbour,
and there's usually plenty of activity going on.
On day two you'll take the coach to the small town of Peel,
on the way calling in at the Tynwald Exhibition.
The Isle of Man isn't part of the United Kingdom,
and it has its own parliament, called Tynwald.
It's claimed that this is the world's oldest parliament that's still functioning,
and that it dates back to 979.
However, the earliest surviving reference to it is from 1422,
so perhaps it isn't quite as old as it claims!
Day three we have a trip to the mountain Snaefell.
This begins with a leisurely ride along the promenade in Douglas in a horse-drawn tram.
Then you board an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxey.
From there it's an eight-kilometre ride in the Snaefell Mountain Railway to the top.
Lunch will be in the caf√©, giving you spectacular views of the island.
Day four is free for you to explore, using the pass which we'll give you.
So you won't have to pay for travel on local transport,
or for entrance to the island's heritage sites.
Or you might just want to take it easy in Douglas and perhaps do a little light shopping.
The last full day, day five, is for some people the highlight of the holiday,
with a ride on the steam railway, from Douglas to Port Erin.
After some time to explore,
a coach will take you to the headland that overlooks the Calf of Man,
a small island just off the coast.
From there you continue to Castletown,
which used to be the capital of the Isle of Man, and its mediaeval castle.
And on day six it's back to the ferry -
or the airport, if you flew to the island - and time to go home.
Now I'd like to tell you...

1056,Cam15 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam15---test-1---part-3,76,"Ed, how are you getting on with the reading for our presentation next week?
Well, OK, Ruth - but there's so much of it.
I know,
I hadn't realised birth order was such a popular area of research.
But the stuff on birth order and personality is mostly unreliable.
From what I've been reading,
a lot of the claims about how your position in the family determines certain personality traits are just stereotypes,
with no robust evidence to support them.
OK, but that's an interesting point -
we could start by outlining what previous research has shown.
There are studies going back over a hundred years.
Yeah - so we could just run through some of the typical traits.
Like the consensus seems to be that oldest children are generally less well-adjusted
because they never get over the arrival of a younger sibling.
Right, but on a positive note,
some studies claimed that they were thought to be good at nurturing -
certainly in the past when people had large families,
they would have been expected to look after the younger ones.
There isn't such a clear picture for middle children -
but one trait that a lot of the studies mention
is that they are easier to get on with than older or younger siblings.
Mm. Generally eager to please and helpful -
although that's certainly not accurate as far as my family goes -
my middle brother was a nightmare -
always causing fights and envious of whatever I had.
As I said - none of this seems to relate to my own experience.
I'm the youngest in my family
and I don't recognise myself in any of the studies I've read about.
I'm supposed to have been a sociable and confident child who made friends easily
but I was actually terribly shy.
Really? That's funny.
There have been hundreds of studies on twins but mostly about nurture versus nature‚Ä¶
There was one on personality, which said that a twin is likely to be quite shy in social situations
because they always have their twin around to depend on for support.
My cousins were like that when they were small -
they were only interested in each other and found it hard to engage with other kids.
They're fine now though.
Only children have had a really bad press -
a lot of studies have branded them as loners who think the world revolves around them
because they've never had to fight for their parents' attention.
That does seem a bit harsh.
One category I hadn't considered before was children with much older siblings -
a couple of studies mentioned that these children grow up more quickly
and are expected to do basic things for themselves - like getting dressed.
I can see how that might be true -
although I expect they're sometimes the exact opposite -
playing the baby role and clamouring for special treatment.
What was the problem with most of these studies, do you think?
I think it was because
in a lot of cases data was collected from only one sibling per family,
who rated him or herself and his or her siblings at the same time.
Some of the old research into the relationship between birth order and academic achievement has been proved to be accurate though.
Performances in intelligence tests decline slightly from the eldest child to his or her younger siblings.
This has been proved in lots of recent studies.
Yes. Although what many of them didn't take into consideration was family size.
The more siblings there are, the likelier the family is to have a low socioeconomic status -
which can also account for differences between siblings in academic performance.
The oldest boy might be given more opportunities than his younger sisters, for example.
Exactly.
But the main reason for the marginally higher academic performance of oldest children is quite surprising, I think.
It's not only that they benefit intellectually from extra attention at a young age -
which is what I would have expected.
It's that they benefit from being teachers for their younger siblings, by verbalising processes.
Right, and this gives them status and confidence,
which again contributes, in a small way, to better performance.
So would you say sibling rivalry has been a useful thing for you?
I think so, my younger brother was incredibly annoying.
And we fought a lot
but I think this has made me a stronger person.
I know how to defend myself.
We had some terrible arguments and I would have died rather than apologise to him.
But we had to put up with each other and most of the time we coexisted amicably enough.
Yes, my situation was pretty similar.
But I don't think having two older brothers made me any less selfish.
I was never prepared to let my brothers use any of my stuff...
That's perfectly normal...

1057,Cam15 - Test 1 - Part 4,B2,cam15---test-1---part-4,75,"Today I'm going to talk about the eucalyptus tree.
This is a very common tree here in Australia,
where it's also sometimes called the gum tree.
First I'm going to talk about why it's important,
then I'm going to describe some problems it faces at present.
Right, well the eucalyptus tree is an important tree for lots of reasons.
For example, it gives shelter to creatures like birds and bats,
and these and other species also depend on it for food,
particularly the nectar from its flowers.
So it supports biodiversity.
It's useful to us humans too,
because we can kill germs with a disinfectant made from oil extracted from eucalyptus leaves.
The eucalyptus grows all over Australia
and the trees can live for up to 400 years.
So it's alarming that all across the country,
numbers of eucalyptus are falling because the trees are dying off prematurely.
So what are the reasons for this?
One possible reason is disease.
As far back as the 1970s the trees started getting a disease called Mundulla Yellows.
The trees' leaves would gradually turn yellow, then the tree would die.
It wasn't until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime,
or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name,
which was being used in the construction of roads.
The lime was being washed away into the ground and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby.
What it was doing was preventing the trees from sucking up the iron they needed for healthy growth.
When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered.
But this problem only affected a relatively small number of trees.
By 2000, huge numbers of eucalyptus were dying along Australia's East Coast,
of a disease known as Bell-miner Associated Die-back.
The bell-miner is a bird,
and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of bell-miners.
Again it's the leaves of the trees that are affected.
What happens is that insects settle on the leaves
and eat their way round them, destroying them as they go,
and at the same time they secrete a solution which has sugar in it.
The bell-miner birds really like this solution,
and in order to get as much as possible,
they keep away other creatures that might try to get it.
So these birds and insects flourish at the expense of other species,
and eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies.
But experts say that trees can start looking sick before any sign of Bell-miner Associated Die-back.
So it looks as if the problem might have another explanation.
One possibility is that it's to do with the huge bushfires that we have in Australia.
A theory proposed over 40 years ago by ecologist William Jackson
is that the frequency of bushfires in a particular region affects the type of vegetation that grows there.
If there are very frequent bushfires in a region,
this encourages grass to grow afterwards,
while if the bushfires are rather less frequent,
this results in the growth of eucalyptus forests.
So why is this?
Why do fairly frequent bushfires actually support the growth of eucalyptus?
Well, one reason is that the fire stops the growth of other species
which would consume water needed by eucalyptus trees.
And there's another reason.
If these other quick-growing species of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate,
they harm the eucalyptus in another way,
by affecting the composition of the soil, and removing nutrients from it.
So some bushfires are actually essential for the eucalyptus to survive
as long as they are not too frequent.
In fact there's evidence that Australia's indigenous people practised regular burning of bush land for thousands of years
before the arrival of the Europeans.
But since Europeans arrived on the continent,
the number of bushfires has been strictly controlled.
Now scientists believe that this reduced frequency of bushfires to low levels
has led to what's known as 'dry rainforest',
which seems an odd name as usually we associate tropical rainforest with wet conditions.
And what's special about this type of rainforest?
Well, unlike tropical rainforest which is a rich ecosystem,
this type of ecosystem is usually a simple one.
It has very thick, dense vegetation,
but not much variety of species.
The vegetation provides lots of shade,
so one species that does find it ideal is the bell-miner bird,
which builds its nests in the undergrowth there.
But again that's not helpful for the eucalyptus tree.

1058,Cam15 - Test 2 - Part 1,B1,cam15---test-2---part-1,88,"Good morning. You're through to the tourist information office.
Tim speaking. How can I help you?
Oh hello.
Could you give me some information about next month's festival, please?
My family and I will be staying in the town that week.
Of course.
Well, it starts with a concert on the afternoon of the 17th.
Oh I heard about that.
The orchestra and singers come from the USA, don't they?
They're from Canada.
They're very popular over there.
They're going to perform a number of well-known pieces that will appeal to children as well as adults.
That sounds good.
My whole family are interested in music.
The next day, the 18th,
there's a performance by a ballet company called Eustatis.
Sorry?
The name is spelt E-U-S-T-A-T-I-S.
They appeared in last year's festival, and went down very well.
Again, their programme is designed for all ages.
Good.
I expect we'll go to that.
I hope there's going to be a play during the festival, a comedy, ideally.
You're in luck!
On the 19th and 20th a local amateur group are performing one written by a member of the group.
It's called Jemima.
That'll be on in the town hall.
They've already performed it two or three times.
I haven't seen it myself,
but the review in the local paper was very good.
And is it suitable for children?
Yes, in fact it's aimed more at children than at adults,
so both performances are in the afternoon.
And what about dance?
Will there be any performances?
Yes, also on the 20th, but in the evening.
A professional company is putting on a show of modern pieces,
with electronic music by young composers.
Uh-huh.
The show is about how people communicate, or fail to communicate, with each other,
so it's got the rather strange name, Chat.
I suppose that's because that's something we do both face to face and online.
That's right.
Now there are also some workshops and other activities.
They'll all take place at least once every day,
so everyone who wants to take part will have a chance.
Good.
We're particularly interested in cookery -
you don't happen to have a cookery workshop, do you?
We certainly do.
It's going to focus on how to make food part of a healthy lifestyle,
and it'll show that even sweet things like cakes can contain much less sugar than they usually do.
That might be worth going to.
We're trying to encourage our children to cook.
Another workshop is just for children,
and that's on creating posters to reflect the history of the town.
The aim is to make children aware of how both the town and people's lives have changed over the centuries.
The results will be exhibited in the community centre.
Then the other workshop is in toy-making,
and that's for adults only.
Oh, why's that?
Because it involves carpentry -
participants will be making toys out of wood,
so there'll be a lot of sharp chisels and other tools around.
It makes sense to keep children away from it.
Exactly.
Now let me tell you about some of the outdoor activities.
There'll be supervised wild swimming‚Ä¶
Wild swimming?
What's that?
It just means swimming in natural waters, rather than a swimming pool.
Oh OK.
In a lake, for instance.
Yes, there's a beautiful one just outside the town,
and that'll be the venue for the swimming.
There'll be lifeguards on duty, so it's suitable for all ages.
And finally, there'll be a walk in some nearby woods every day.
The leader is an expert on insects.
He'll show some that live in the woods, and how important they are for the environment.
So there are going to be all sorts of different things to do during the festival.
There certainly are.
If you'd like to read about how the preparations for the festival are going,
the festival organizer is keeping a blog.
Just search online for the festival website, and you'll find it.
Well, thank you very much for all the information.
You're welcome.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

1059,Cam15 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam15---test-2---part-2,68,"I'm very pleased to welcome this evening's guest speaker, Mark Logan,
who's going to tell us about the recent transformation of Minster Park.
Over to you, Mark.
Thank you.
I'm sure you're all familiar with Minster Park.
It's been a feature of the city for well over a century,
and has been the responsibility of the city council for most of that time.
What perhaps isn't so well known is the origin of the park:
unlike many public parks that started in private ownership,
as the garden of a large house, for instance,
Minster was some waste land,
which people living nearby started planting with flowers in 1892.
It was unclear who actually owned the land,
and this wasn't settled until 20 years later,
when the council took possession of it.
You may have noticed the statue near one of the entrances.
It's of Diane Gosforth,
who played a key role in the history of the park.
Once the council had become the legal owner,
it planned to sell the land for housing.
Many local people wanted it to remain a place that everyone could go to,
to enjoy the fresh air and natural environment -
remember, the park is in a densely populated residential area.
Diane Gosforth was one of those people,
and she organised petitions and demonstrations,
which eventually made the council change its mind about the future of the land.
Soon after this the First World War broke out, in 1914,
and most of the park was dug up and planted with vegetables,
which were sold locally.
At one stage, the army considered taking it over for troop exercises
and got as far as contacting the city council,
then decided the park was too small to be of use.
There were occasional public meetings during the war,
in an area that had been retained as grass.
After the war, the park was turned back more or less to how it had been before 1914,
and continued almost unchanged until recently.
Plans for transforming it were drawn up at various times,
most recently in 2013,
though they were revised in 2015,
before any work had started.
The changes finally got going in 2016,
and were finished on schedule last year.
OK, let me tell you about some of the changes that have been made
and some things that have been retained.
If you look at this map,
you'll see the familiar outline of the park,
with the river forming the northern boundary,
and a gate in each of the other three walls.
The statue of Diane Gosforth has been moved:
it used to be close to the south gate,
but it's now immediately to the north of the lily pond,
almost in the centre of the park, which makes it much more visible.
There's a new area of wooden sculptures, which are on the river bank,
where the path from the east gate makes a sharp bend.
There are two areas that are particularly intended for children.
The playground has been enlarged and improved,
and that's between the river and the path that leads from the pond to the river.
Then there's a new maze, a circular series of paths, separated by low hedges.
That's near the west gate -
you go north from there towards the river and then turn left to reach it.
There have been tennis courts in the park for many years,
and they've been doubled, from four to eight.
They're still in the south-west corner of the park,
where there's a right-angle bend in the path.
Something else I'd like to mention is the new fitness area.
This is right next to the lily pond on the same side as the west gate.
Now, as you're all gardeners,
I'm sure you'll like to hear about the plants that have been chosen for the park.

1060,Cam15 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam15---test-2---part-3,93,"OK, Graham, so let's check we both know what we're supposed to be doing.
OK.
So, for the university's open day,
we have to plan a display on British life and literature in the mid-19th century.
That's right.
But we'll have some people to help us find the materials and set it up, remember.
For the moment, we just need to plan it.
Good.
So have you gathered who's expected to come and see the display?
Is it for the people studying English, or students from other departments?
I'm not clear about it.
Nor me.
That was how it used to be,
but it didn't attract many people, so this year it's going to be part of an open day,
to raise the university's profile.
It'll be publicised in the city, to encourage people to come and find out something of what goes on here.
And it's included in the information that's sent to people who are considering applying to study here next year.
Presumably some current students and lecturers will come?
I would imagine so,
but we've been told to concentrate on the other categories of people.
Right.
We don't have to cover the whole range of 19th-century literature, do we?
No, it's entirely up to us.
I suggest just using Charles Dickens.
That's a good idea.
Most people have heard of him, and have probably read some of his novels,
or seen films based on them,
so that's a good lead-in to life in his time.
Exactly.
And his novels show the awful conditions that most people had to live in, don't they:
he wanted to shock people into doing something about it.
Did he do any campaigning, other than writing?
Yes, he campaigned for education and other social reforms, and gave talks,
but I'm inclined to ignore that and focus on the novels.
Yes, I agree.
OK, so now shall we think about a topic linked to each novel?
Yes. I've printed out a list of Dickens's novels in the order they were published,
in the hope you'd agree to focus on him!
You're lucky I did agree!
Let's have a look.
OK, the first was The Pickwick Papers, published in 1836.
It was very successful when it came out, wasn't it,
and was adapted for the theatre straight away.
There's an interesting point, though,
that there's a character who keeps falling asleep,
and that medical condition was named after the book - Pickwickian Syndrome.
So why don't we use that as the topic,
and include some quotations from the novel?
Right, Next is Oliver Twist.
There's a lot in the novel about poverty.
But maybe something less obvious‚Ä¶
Well Oliver is taught how to steal, isn't he?
We could use that to illustrate the fact that very few children went to school,
particularly not poor children, so they learnt in other ways.
Good idea.
What's next?
Maybe Nicholas Nickleby.
Actually he taught in a really cruel school, didn't he?
That's right.
But there's also the company of touring actors that Nicholas joins.
We could do something on theatres and other amusements of the time.
We don't want only the bad things, do we?
OK.
What about Martin Chuzzlewit?
He goes to the USA, doesn't he?
Yes, and Dickens himself had been there a year before,
and drew on his experience there in the novel.
I wonder, though‚Ä¶
The main theme is selfishness,
so we could do something on social justice?
Hmm... No, too general, let's keep to your idea.
I think it would work well.
He wrote Bleak House next - that's my favourite of his novels.
It's mine too.
His satire of the legal system is pretty powerful.
That's true, but think about Esther, the heroine.
As a child she lives with someone she doesn't know is her aunt,
who treats her very badly.
Then she's very happy living with her guardian,
and he puts her in charge of the household.
And at the end she gets married and her guardian gives her and her husband a house,
where of course they're very happy.
Yes, I like that.
What shall we take next?
Little Dorrit?
Old Mr Dorrit has been in a debtors' prison for years‚Ä¶
So was Dickens's father, wasn't he?
That's right.
What about focusing on the part when Mr Dorrit inherits a fortune,
and he starts pretending he's always been rich?
Good idea.
So, next, we need to think about what materials we want to illustrate each issue.
That's going to be quite hard.

1061,Cam15 - Test 2 - Part 4,B2,cam15---test-2---part-4,63,"I'm going to report on a case study of a programme
which has been set up to help rural populations in Mozambique,
a largely agricultural country in South-East Africa.
The programme worked with three communities in Chicualacuala district,
near the Limpopo River.
This is a dry and arid region, with unpredictable rainfall.
Because of this, people in the area were unable to support themselves through agriculture
and instead they used the forest as a means of providing themselves with an income,
mainly by selling charcoal.
However, this was not a sustainable way of living in the long term,
as they were rapidly using up this resource.
To support agriculture in this dry region,
the programme focused primarily on making use of existing water resources from the Limpopo River
by setting up systems of irrigation,
which would provide a dependable water supply for crops and animals.
The programme worked closely with the district government in order to find the best way of implementing this.
The region already had one farmers' association,
and it was decided to set up two more of these.
These associations planned and carried out activities including water management,
livestock breeding and agriculture,
and it was notable that in general, women formed the majority of the workforce.
It was decided that in order to keep the crops safe from animals, both wild and domestic,
special areas should be fenced off where the crops could be grown.
The community was responsible for creating these fences,
but the programme provided the necessary wire for making them.
Once the area had been fenced off, it could be cultivated.
The land was dug, so that vegetables and cereals appropriate to the climate could be grown,
and the programme provided the necessary seeds for this.
The programme also provided pumps so that water could be brought from the river in pipes to the fields.
However, the labour was all provided by local people,
and they also provided and put up the posts that supported the fences around the fields.
Once the programme had been set up,
its development was monitored carefully.
The farmers were able to grow enough produce
not just for their own needs, but also to sell.
However, getting the produce to places where it could be marketed was sometimes a problem,
as the farmers did not have access to transport,
and this resulted in large amounts of produce,
especially vegetables, being spoiled.
This problem was discussed with the farmers' associations
and it was decided that in order to prevent food from being spoiled,
the farmers needed to learn techniques for its preservation.
There was also an additional initiative that had not been originally planned,
but which became a central feature of the programme.
This was when farmers started to dig holes for tanks in the fenced-off areas
and to fill these with water and use them for breeding fish -
an important source of protein.
After a time, another suggestion was made by local people
which hadn't been part of the programme's original proposal,
but which was also adopted later on.
They decided to try setting up colonies of bees,
which would provide honey both for their own consumption and to sell.
So what lessons can be learned from this programme?
First of all, it tells us that in dry, arid regions,
if there is access to a reliable source of water,
there is great potential for the development of agriculture.
In Chicualacuala, there was a marked improvement in agricultural production,
which improved food security
and benefited local people by providing them with both food and income.
However, it's important to set realistic timelines for each phase of the programme,
especially for its design,
as mistakes made at this stage may be hard to correct later on.
The programme demonstrates that sustainable development is possible in areas where‚Ä¶

1062,Cam15 - Test 3 - Part 1,B1,cam15---test-3---part-1,98,"Good morning.
Thanks for coming in to see us here at the agency, Joe.
I'm one of the agency representatives, and my name's Sally Baker.
Hi Sally. I think we spoke on the phone, didn't we?
That's right, we did.
So thank you for sending in your CV.
We've had quite a careful look at it
and I think we have two jobs that might be suitable for you.
OK.
The first one is in a company based in North London.
They're looking for an administrative assistant.
OK.
What sort of company is it?
They're called Home Solutions
and they design and make furniture.
Oh, I don't know much about that,
but it sounds interesting.
Yes, well as I said, they want someone in their office,
and looking at your past experience
it does look as if you fit quite a few of the requirements.
So on your CV it appears you've done some data entry?
Yes.
So that's one skill they want.
Then they expect the person they appoint to attend meetings and take notes there‚Ä¶
OK.
I've done that before, yes.
And you'd need to be able to cope with general admin.
Filing, and keeping records and so on?
That should be OK.
And in my last job I also had to manage the diary.
Excellent.
That's something they want here too.
I'd suggest you add it to your CV.
I don't think you mentioned that, did you?
No.
So as far as the requirements go, they want good computer skills, of course,
and they particularly mention spreadsheets.
That should be fine.
And interpersonal skills,
which would be something they'd check with your references.
I think that should be OK, yes.
Then they mention that they want someone who is careful and takes care with details.
Just looking at your CV, I'd say you're probably alright there.
I think so, yes.
Do they want any special experience?
I think they wanted some experience of teleconferencing.
I've got three years' experience of that.
Let's see, yes, good.
In fact they're only asking for at least one year, so that's great.
So is that something that might interest you?
It is, yes.
The only thing is, you said they were in North London
so it would be quite a long commute for me.
OK.
So the second position might suit you better as far as the location goes;
that's for a warehouse assistant and that's in South London.
Yes, that would be a lot closer.
And you've worked in a warehouse before, haven't you?
Yes.
So as far as the responsibilities for this position go,
they want someone who can manage the stock, obviously, and also deliveries.
That should be OK.
You've got to keep track of stuff,
but I've always been quite good with numbers.
Good, that's their first requirement.
And they want someone who's computer literate, which we know you are.
Sure.
Then they mention organisational skills.
They want someone who's well organised.
Yes, I think I am.
And tidy?
Yes, they go together really, don't they?
Sure.
Then the usual stuff; they want someone who can communicate well both orally and in writing.
OK.
And for the last warehouse job I had,
one of the things I enjoyed most was being part of a team.
I found that was really essential for the job.
Excellent.
Yes, they do mention that they want someone who's used to that, yes.
Now when you were working in a warehouse last time,
what sorts of items were you dealing with?
It was mostly bathroom and kitchen equipment,
sinks and stoves and fridges.
So you're OK moving heavy things?
Sure.
I'm quite strong, and I've had the training.
Good.
Now as far as experience goes, they mention they want someone with a licence,
and that you have experience of driving in London -
so you can cope with the traffic and so on.
Yes, no problem.
And you've got experience of warehouse work‚Ä¶
and the final thing they mention is customer service.
I think looking at your CV you're OK there.
Right.
So what about pay?
Can you tell me a bit more about that, please‚Ä¶

1063,Cam15 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam15---test-3---part-2,76,"My guest on the show today is Alice Riches
who started the Street Play Scheme where she lives in Beechwood Road.
For those of you that don't already know,
Street Play involves local residents closing off their street for a few hours
so that children have a chance to play in the street safely.
She started it in her own street, Beechwood Road,
and the idea caught on,
and there are now Street Play Schemes all over the city.
So when did you actually start the scheme, Alice?
Well, I first had the idea when my oldest child was still a toddler,
so that's about six years ago now,
but it took at least two years of campaigning before we were actually able to make it happen.
So the scheme's been up and running for three years now.
We'd love to be able to close our road for longer,
for the whole weekend, from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, for example.
At the moment it's just once a week.
But when we started it was only once a month.
But we're working on it.
So what actually happens when Beechwood Road is closed?
We have volunteer wardens,
mostly parents but some elderly residents too,
who block off our road at either end.
The council have provided special signs
but there's always a volunteer there to explain what's happening to any motorists.
Generally, they're fine about it,
we've only had to get the police involved once or twice.
Now I should explain that the road isn't completely closed to cars.
But only residents' cars are allowed.
If people really need to get in or out of Beechwood Road,
it's not a problem,
as long as they drive at under 20 kilometres per hour.
But most people just decide not to use their cars during this time,
or they park in another street.
The wardens are only there to stop through traffic.
So can anyone apply to get involved in Street Play?
Absolutely!
We want to include all kids in the city,
especially those who live on busy roads.
It's here that demand is greatest.
Obviously, there isn't such demand in wealthier areas
where the children have access to parks or large gardens,
or in the suburbs where there are usually more places for children to play outside.
I'd recommend that anyone listening who likes the idea should just give it a go.
We've been surprised by the positive reaction of residents all over the city.
And that's not just parents.
There are always a few who complain but they're a tiny minority.
On the whole everyone is very supportive
and say they're very happy to see children out on the street,
even if it does get quite noisy.
There have been so many benefits of Street Play for the kids.
Parents really like the fact that the kids are getting fresh air
instead of sitting staring at a computer screen,
even if they're not doing anything particularly energetic.
And of course it's great that kids can play with their friends outside without being supervised by their parents,
but for me the biggest advantage is that kids develop confidence in themselves to be outside without their parents.
The other really fantastic thing is that children get to know the adults in the street,
it's like having a big extended family.
It certainly does have a lot of benefits.
I want to move on now and ask you about a related project in King Street.
Right.
Well this was an experiment I was involved in
where local residents decided to try and reduce the traffic along King Street,
which is the busiest main road in our area,
by persuading people not to use their cars for one day.
We thought about making people pay more for parking,
but we decided that would be really unpopular,
so instead we just stopped people from parking on King Street
but left the other car parks open.
It was surprising how much of a difference all this made.
As we'd predicted, air quality was significantly better
but what I hadn't expected was how much quieter it would be,
even with the buses still running.
Of course everyone said they felt safer
but we were actually amazed that sales in the shops went up considerably that day,
we thought there'd be fewer people out shopping, not more.
That's really interesting...

1064,Cam15 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam15---test-3---part-3,77,"Tom, could I ask you for some advice, please?
Yes of course, if you think I can help.
What's it about?
It's my first media studies assignment, and I'm not sure how to go about it.
You must have done it last year.
Is that the one comparing the coverage of a particular story in a range of newspapers?
That's right.
Oh yes, I really enjoyed writing it.
So what sort of things do I need to compare?
Well, there are several things.
For example, there's the question of which page of the newspaper the item appears on.
You mean, because there's a big difference between having it on the front page and the bottom of page ten, for instance?
Exactly.
And that shows how important the editor thinks the story is.
Then there's the size:
how many column inches the story is given,
how many columns it spreads over.
And I suppose that includes the headline.
It certainly does.
It's all part of attracting the reader's attention.
What about graphics -
whether there's anything visual in addition to the text?
Yes, you need to consider those, too,
because they can have a big effect on the reader's understanding of the story -
sometimes a bigger effect than the text itself.
Then you'll need to look at how the item is put together:
what structure is it given?
Bear in mind that not many people read beyond the first paragraph,
so what has the journalist put at the beginning?
And if, say, there are conflicting opinions about something,
does one appear near the end, where people probably won't read it?
And newspapers sometimes give wrong or misleading information, don't they?
Either deliberately or by accident.
Should I be looking at that, too?
Yes, if you can.
Compare what's in different versions, and as far as possible,
try and work out what's true and what isn't.
And that relates to a very important point:
what's the writer's purpose,
or at least the most important one, if they have several.
It may seem to be to inform the public,
but often it's that they want to create fear, or controversy,
or to make somebody look ridiculous.
Gosh, I see what you mean.
I suppose the writer may make assumptions about the reader.
That's right - about their knowledge of the subject, their attitudes, and their level of education,
which means writing so that the readers understand without feeling patronised.
All of that will make a difference to how the story is presented.
Does it matter what type of story I write about?
No, national or international politics, the arts‚Ä¶ anything,
as long as it's covered in two or three newspapers.
Though of course it'll be easier and more fun if it's something you're interested in and know something about.
And on that basis a national news item would be worth analysing -
I'm quite keen on politics, so I'll try and find a suitable topic.
What did you choose for your analysis, Tom?
I was interested in how newspapers express their opinions explicitly,
so I wanted to compare editorials in different papers,
but when I started looking,
I couldn't find two on the same topic that I felt like analysing.
In that case, I won't even bother to look.
So in the end I chose a human interest story -
a terribly emotional story about a young girl who was very ill,
and lots of other people - mostly strangers -
raised money so she could go abroad for treatment.
Actually, I was surprised -
some papers just wrote about how wonderful everyone was,
but others considered the broader picture,
like why treatment wasn't available here.
Hmm, I usually find stories like that raise quite strong feelings in me!
I'll avoid that.
Perhaps I'll choose an arts topic,
like different reviews of a film, or something about funding for the arts -
I'll think about that.
Yes, that might be interesting.
OK, well thanks a lot for your help, Tom. It's been really useful.
You're welcome.
Good luck with the assignment, Hazel.

1065,Cam15 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam15---test-3---part-4,64,"Nowadays, we use different products for personal cleanliness, laundry, dishwashing and household cleaning,
but this is very much a 20th-century development.
The origins of cleanliness date back to prehistoric times.
Since water is essential for life,
the earliest people lived near water and knew something about its cleansing properties -
at least that it rinsed mud off their hands.
During the excavation of ancient Babylon,
evidence was found that soapmaking was known as early as 2800 BC.
Archaeologists discovered cylinders made of clay,
with inscriptions on them saying that fats were boiled with ashes.
This is a method of making soap,
though there's no reference to the purpose of this material.
The early Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently didn't use soap.
Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand, pumice and ashes,
then anointed themselves with oil,
and scraped off the oil and dirt with a metal instrument known as a strigil.
They also used oil mixed with ashes.
Clothes were washed without soap in streams.
The ancient Germans and Gauls are also credited with discovering how to make a substance called 'soap',
made of melted animal fat and ashes.
They used this mixture to tint their hair red.
Soap got its name, according to an ancient Roman legend, from Mount Sapo,
where animals were sacrificed, leaving deposits of animal fat.
Rain washed these deposits, along with wood ashes,
down into the clay soil along the River Tiber.
Women found that this mixture greatly reduced the effort required to wash their clothes.
As Roman civilisation advanced, so did bathing.
The first of the famous Roman baths, supplied with water from their aqueducts,
was built around 312 BC.
The baths were luxurious, and bathing became very popular.
And by the second century AD,
the Greek physician Galen recommended soap for both medicinal and cleansing purposes.
After the fall of Rome in 467 AD
and the resulting decline in bathing habits,
much of Europe felt the impact of filth on public health.
This lack of personal cleanliness and related unsanitary living conditions
were major factors in the outbreaks of disease in the Middle Ages,
and especially the Black Death of the 14th century.
Nevertheless, soapmaking became an established craft in Europe,
and associations of soapmakers guarded their trade secrets closely.
Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants,
along with perfume, apparently for the first time.
Gradually more varieties of soap became available for shaving and shampooing,
as well as bathing and laundering.
A major step toward large-scale commercial soapmaking occurred in 1791,
when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for turning salt into soda ash,
or sodium carbonate.
Soda ash is the alkali obtained from ashes that combines with fat to form soap.
The Leblanc process yielded quantities of good-quality, inexpensive soda ash.
Modern soapmaking was born some 20 years later,
in the early 19th century,
with the discovery by Michel Eugene Chevreul, another French chemist,
of the chemical nature and relationship of fats, glycerine and fatty acids.
His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry,
and soapmaking became a science.
Further developments during the 19th century made it easier and cheaper to manufacture soap.
Until the 19th century, soap was regarded as a luxury item,
and was heavily taxed in several countries.
As it became more readily available, it became an everyday necessity,
a development that was reinforced when the high tax was removed.
Soap was then something ordinary people could afford,
and cleanliness standards improved.
With this widespread use came the development of milder soaps for bathing
and soaps for use in the washing machines that were available to consumers by the turn of the 20th century.

1066,Cam15 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam15---test-4---part-1,94,"Hello. Do you mind if I ask you some questions about your journey today?
We're doing a customer satisfaction survey.
Yes. OK. I've got about ten minutes before my train home leaves.
I'm on a day trip.
Great. Thank you.
So first of all, could you tell me your name?
It's Sophie Bird.
Thank you.
And would you mind telling me what you do?
I'm a journalist.
Oh really? That must be interesting.
Yes. It is.
So was the reason for your visit here today work?
Actually, it's my day off.
I came here to do some shopping.
Oh right.
But I do sometimes come here for work.
OK.
Now I'd like to ask some questions about your journey today, if that's OK.
Yes. No problem.
Right, so can you tell me which station you're travelling back to?
Staunfirth, where I live.
Ah, can I just check the spelling?
STAUNFIRTH?
That's right.
And you travelled from there this morning?
Yes.
OK, good.
Next, can I ask what kind of ticket you bought?
I assume it wasn't a season ticket, as you don't travel every day.
That's right. No, I just got a normal return ticket.
I don't have a rail card so I didn't get any discount.
I keep meaning to get one because it's a lot cheaper.
Yes - you'd have saved 20% on your ticket today.
So you paid the full price for your ticket?
I paid ¬£23.70.
OK.
Do you think that's good value for money?
Not really.
I think it's too much for a journey that only takes 45 minutes.
Yes, that's one of the main complaints we get.
So, you didn't buy your ticket in advance?
No.
I know it's cheaper if you buy a week in advance but I didn't know I was coming then.
I know.
You can't always plan ahead, so...
er.. did you buy it this morning?
No, it was yesterday.
Right.
And do you usually buy your tickets at the station?
Well, I do usually but the ticket office closes early and I hate using ticket machines.
I think ticket offices should be open for longer hours.
There's always a queue for the machines and they're often out of order.
Hmm... A lot of customers are saying the same thing.
So to answer your question‚Ä¶ I got an e-ticket online.
OK.
Thank you.
Now I'd like to ask you about your satisfaction with your journey.
So what would you say you were most satisfied with today?
Well, I like the wifi on the train.
It's improved a lot.
It makes it easier for me to work if I want to.
That's the first time today anyone's mentioned that.
It's good to get some positive feedback on that.
And, um... is there anything you weren't satisfied with?
Well, normally, the trains run on time and are pretty reliable
but today there was a delay;
the train was about 15 minutes behind schedule.
OK. I'll put that down.
Now I'd also like to ask about the facilities at this station.
You've probably noticed that the whole station's been upgraded.
What are you most satisfied with?
Oh... I think the best thing is that they've improved the amount of information about train times etc. that's given to passengers -
it's much clearer -
before there was only one board and I couldn't always see it properly,
which was frustrating.
That's good.
And is there anything you're not satisfied with?
Let's see‚Ä¶
I think things have generally improved a lot.
The trains are much more modern and I like the new caf√©.
But one thing is that there aren't enough places to sit down,
especially on the platforms.
OK,
so I'll put 'seating' down, shall I, as the thing you're least satisfied with?
Yes, OK.
Can I ask your opinion about some of the other facilities?
We'd like feedback on whether people are satisfied, dissatisfied or neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.
OK.
What about the parking at the station?
Well to be honest, I don't really have an opinion as I never use it.
So, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied for that then.
Yes, I suppose so‚Ä¶
OK, and what about‚Ä¶

1067,Cam15 - Test 4 - Part 2,B2,cam15---test-4---part-2,46,"As chair of the town council subcommittee on park facilities,
I'd like to bring you up to date on some of the changes that have been made recently to the Croft Valley Park.
So if you could just take a look at the map I handed out,
let's begin with a general overview.
So the basic arrangement of the park hasn't changed -
it still has two gates, north and south, and a lake in the middle.
The caf√© continues to serve an assortment of drinks and snacks
and is still in the same place,
looking out over the lake and next to the old museum.
We're hoping to change the location of the toilets,
and bring them nearer to the centre of the park
as they're a bit out of the way at present, near the adventure playground, in the corner of your map.
The formal gardens have been replanted and should be at their best in a month or two.
They used to be behind the old museum,
but we've now used the space near the south gate -
between the park boundary and the path that goes past the lake towards the old museum.
We have a new outdoor gym for adults and children,
which is already proving very popular.
It's by the glass houses, just to the right of the path from the south gate.
You have to look for it as it's a bit hidden in the trees.
One very successful introduction has been our skateboard ramp.
It's in constant use during the evenings and holidays.
It's near the old museum,
at the end of a little path that leads off from the main path between the lake and the museum.
We've also introduced a new area for wild flowers, to attract bees and butterflies.
It's on a bend in the path that goes round the east side of the lake,
just south of the adventure playground.
Now let me tell you a bit more about some of the changes to Croft Valley Park.
One of our most exciting developments has been the adventure playground.
We were aware that we had nowhere for children to let off steam,
and decided to use our available funds
to set up a completely new facility in a large space to the north of the park.
It's open year-round, though it closes early in the winter months,
and entrance is completely free.
Children can choose whatever activities they want to do, irrespective of their age,
but we do ask adults not to leave them on their own there.
There are plenty of seats where parents can relax and keep an eye on their children at the same time.
Lastly, the glass houses.
A huge amount of work has been done on them
to repair the damage following the disastrous fire that recently destroyed their western side.
Over ¬£80,000 was spent on replacing the glass walls and the metal supports,
as well as the plants that had been destroyed,
although unfortunately the collection of tropical palm trees has proved too expensive to replace up to now.
At present the glass houses are open from 10 am to 3 pm Mondays to Thursdays,
and it's hoped to extend this to the weekend soon.
We're grateful to all those who helped us by contributing their time and money to this achievement.

1068,Cam15 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam15---test-4---part-3,92,"OK, Jack. Before we plan our presentation about refrigeration,
let's discuss what we've discovered so far.
Fine, Annie.
Though I have to admit I haven't done much research yet.
Nor me.
But I found an interesting article about icehouses.
I'd seen some 18th- and 19th-century ones here in the UK,
so I knew they were often built in a shady area or underground,
close to lakes that might freeze in the winter.
Then blocks of ice could be cut and stored in the icehouse.
But I didn't realise that insulating the blocks with straw or sawdust meant they didn't melt for months.
The ancient Romans had refrigeration, too.
I didn't know that.
Yes, pits were dug in the ground,
and snow was imported from the mountains -
even though they were at quite a distance.
The snow was stored in the pits.
Ice formed at the bottom of it.
Both the ice and the snow were then sold.
The ice cost more than the snow
and my guess is that only the wealthy members of society could afford it.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I also came across an article about modern domestic fridges.
Several different technologies are used,
but they were too complex for me to understand.
You have to wonder what happens when people get rid of old ones.
You mean because the gases in them are harmful for the environment?
Exactly.
At least there are now plenty of organisations that will recycle most of the components safely,
but of course some people just dump old fridges in the countryside.
It's hard to see how they can be stopped unfortunately.
In the UK we get rid of three million a year altogether!
That sounds a lot, especially because fridges hardly ever break down.
That's right.
In this country we keep domestic fridges for 11 years on average,
and a lot last for 20 or more.
So if you divide the cost by the number of years you can use a fridge, they're not expensive,
compared with some household appliances.
True.
I suppose manufacturers encourage people to spend more by making them different colours and designs.
I'm sure when my parents bought their first fridge they had hardly any choice!
Yes, there's been quite a change.
Right, let's make a list of topics to cover in our presentation,
and decide who's going to do more research on them.
Then later, we can get together and plan the next step.
OK.
How about starting with how useful refrigeration is,
and the range of goods that are refrigerated nowadays?
Because of course it's not just food and drinks.
No, I suppose flowers and medicines are refrigerated, too.
And computers.
I could do that, unless you particularly want to.
No, that's fine by me.
What about the effects of refrigeration on people's health?
After all, some of the chemicals used in the 19th century were pretty harmful,
but there have been lots of benefits too,
like always having access to fresh food.
Do you fancy dealing with that?
I'm not terribly keen, to be honest.
Nor me.
My mind just goes blank when I read anything about chemicals.
Oh, all right then, I'll do you a favour.
But you owe me, Jack.
OK.
What about the effects on food producers,
like farmers in poorer countries being able to export their produce to developed countries?
Something for you, maybe?
I don't mind. It should be quite interesting.
I think we should also look at how refrigeration has helped whole cities - like Las Vegas,
which couldn't exist without refrigeration
because it's in the middle of a desert.
Right.
I had a quick look at an economics book in the library that's got a chapter about this sort of thing.
I could give you the title, if you want to do this section.
Not particularly, to be honest.
I find economics books pretty heavy going, as a rule.
OK, leave it to me, then.
Thanks.
Then there's transport,
and the difference that refrigerated trucks have made.
I wouldn't mind having a go at that.
Don't forget trains, too.
I read something about milk and butter being transported in refrigerated railroad cars in the USA,
right back in the 1840s.
I hadn't thought of trains. Thanks.
Shall we have a separate section on domestic fridges?
After all, they're something everyone's familiar with.
What about splitting it into two?
You could investigate 19th- and 20th-century fridges,
and I'll concentrate on what's available these days,
and how manufacturers differentiate their products from those of their competitors.
OK, that'd suit me.

1069,Cam15 - Test 4 - Part 4,C1,cam15---test-4---part-4,64,"Hi everyone,
in this session I'll be presenting my research about the social history of Britain during the Industrial Revolution.
I particularly looked at how ordinary lives were affected by changes that happened at that time.
This was a time that saw the beginning of a new phenomenon; consumerism -
where buying and selling goods became a major part of ordinary people's lives.
In fact, it was in the 19th century that the quantity and quality of people's possessions
was used as an indication of the wealth of the country.
Before this, the vast majority of people had very few possessions,
but all that was changed by the Industrial Revolution.
This was the era from the mid-18th to the late 19th century,
when improvements in how goods were made
as well as in technology triggered massive social changes
that transformed life for just about everybody in several key areas.
First let's look at manufacturing.
When it comes to manufacturing,
we tend to think of the Industrial Revolution in images of steam engines and coal.
And it's true that the Industrial Revolution couldn't have taken place at all
if it weren't for these new sources of power.
They marked an important shift away from the traditional watermills and windmills
that had dominated before this.
The most advanced industry for much of the 19th century was textiles.
This meant that fashionable fabrics, and lace and ribbons were made available to everyone.
Before the Industrial Revolution, most people made goods to sell in small workshops,
often in their own homes.
But enormous new machines were now being created
that could produce the goods faster and on a larger scale,
and these required a lot more space.
So large factories were built,
replacing the workshops, and forcing workers to travel to work.
In fact, large numbers of people migrated from villages into towns as a result.
As well as manufacturing, there were new technologies in transport,
contributing to the growth of consumerism.
The horse-drawn stagecoaches and carts of the 18th century,
which carried very few people and goods,
and travelled slowly along poorly surfaced roads,
were gradually replaced by the numerous canals that were constructed.
These were particularly important for the transportation of goods.
The canals gradually fell out of use, though, as railways were developed,
becoming the main way of moving goods and people from one end of the country to the other.
And the goods they moved weren't just coal, iron, clothes, and so on -
significantly, they included newspapers,
which meant that thousands of people were not only more knowledgeable about what was going on in the country,
but could also read about what was available in the shops.
And that encouraged them to buy more.
so faster forms of transport resulted in distribution becoming far more efficient -
goods could now be sold all over the country, instead of just in the local market.
The third main area that saw changes that contributed to consumerism was retailing.
The number and quality of shops grew rapidly,
and in particular, small shops suffered as customers flocked to the growing number of department stores -
a form of retailing that was new in the 19th century.
The entrepreneurs who opened these found new ways to stock them with goods,
and to attract customers:
for instance, improved lighting inside greatly increased the visibility of the goods for sale.
Another development that made goods more visible from outside resulted from the use of plate glass,
which made it possible for windows to be much larger than previously.
New ways of promoting goods were introduced, too.
Previously, the focus had been on informing potential customers about the availability of goods;
now there was an explosion in advertising trying to persuade people to go shopping.
Flanders claims that one of the great effects of the Industrial Revolution was that it created choice.
All sorts of things that had previously been luxuries -
from sugar to cutlery - became conveniences,
and before long they'd turned into necessities:
life without sugar or cutlery was unimaginable.
Rather like mobile phones these days!

OK, thank you.
And are you resident in the UK?
No, I'm actually Canadian. Though my mother was British.
And your date of birth?
December 14th, 1977.

That's right.
I come over most summers on business.
I'm an interior designer and I come over to buy old furniture, antiques you know.

Well at present I've got a place at Park Apartments, that's on King Street.
I was staying at the Riverside Apartments on the same street,
but the apartment there was only available for six weeks
so I had to find another one.
OK.
And the apartment number?
Fifteen.
Right.
Now, I need to take some details of the theft.
So you said you had some things stolen out of your bag?
That's right.
And were you actually carrying the bag when the theft took place?
Yes, I really can't understand it.
I had my backpack on.
And I went into a supermarket to buy a few things
and when I opened it up my wallet wasn't there.
And what did your wallet have in it?
Well, fortunately I don't keep my credit cards in that wallet,
I keep them with my passport in an inside compartment in my backpack.
But there was quite a bit of cash there‚Ä¶
about ¬£250 sterling, I should think.
I withdrew ¬£300 from my account yesterday,
but I did a bit of shopping,
so I must have already spent about ¬£50 of that.
OK.
At first I thought, oh I must have left the wallet back in the apartment,
but then I realised my phone had gone as well.
It was only a week old,
and that's when I realised I'd been robbed.
Anyway at least they didn't take the keys to my rental car.
Yes.
So you say the theft occurred yesterday?
Yes.
So that was September the tenth.
And do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might possibly have been stolen?
Well at first I couldn't believe it because the bag had been on my back ever since I left the apartment after lunch.
It's just a small backpack,
but I generally use it when I'm travelling because it seems safer than a handbag.
Anyway, I met up with a friend,
and we spent a couple of hours in the museum.
But I do remember that as we were leaving there, at about 4 o'clock,
a group of young boys ran up to us,
and they were really crowding round us,
and they were asking us what time it was,
then all of a sudden they ran off.
Can you remember anything about them?
The one who did most of the talking was wearing a T-shirt with a picture of something‚Ä¶
let's see‚Ä¶ a tiger.
Right.
Any idea of how old he might have been?
Around twelve years old?
And can you remember anything else about his appearance?
Not much.
He was quite thin‚Ä¶
Colour of hair?
I do remember that - he was blond.
All the others were dark-haired.
And any details of the others?
Not really.
They came and went so quickly.
Right.
So what I'm going to do now is give you a crime reference number so you can contact your insurance company.
So this is ten digits:
8795482361.
Thank you.
So should I contact‚Ä¶

1071,Cam14 - Test 1 - Part 2,B1,cam14---test-1---part-2,56,"Good morning everyone.
My name's Janet Parker and I'm the human resources manager.
We're very happy to welcome you to your new apprenticeship.
I hope that the next six months will be a positive and enjoyable experience for you.
I'd like to start with some general advice about being an apprentice.
Most of you have very little or no experience of working for a big organisation
and the first week or so may be quite challenging.
There will be a lot of new information to take in
but don't worry too much about trying to remember everything.
The important thing is to check with someone if you're not sure what to do -
you'll find your supervisor is very approachable and won't mind explaining things or helping you out.
You're here to learn so make the most of that opportunity.
You'll be spending time in different departments during your first week
so make an effort to talk to as many people as possible about their work -
you'll make some new friends and find out lots of useful information.
As well as having a supervisor, you'll each be assigned a mentor.
This person will be someone who's recently completed an apprenticeship
and you'll meet with them on a weekly basis.
Their role is to provide help and support throughout your apprenticeship.
Of course, this doesn't mean they'll actually do any of your work for you -
instead they'll be asking you about what goals you've achieved so far,
as well as helping you to identify any areas for improvement.
You can also discuss your more long-term ambitions with them as well.
Now I just want to run through a few company policies for our apprenticeship scheme with you‚Ä¶
Most importantly, the internet.
As part of your job you'll be doing some research online
so obviously you'll have unlimited access for that
but please don't use it for personal use,
you'll have your own phones for that.
Some of you have already asked me about flexible working.
After your probationary three-month period,
some of you will be eligible for this,
but it will depend on which department you're in and what your personal circumstances are.
So please don't assume you'll automatically be permitted to do this.
I want to make sure there's no confusion about our holiday policy.
Apart from any statutory public holidays
we ask that you don't book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished.
Time off should only be taken if you are unwell.
Please speak to your supervisor if this is going to be a problem.
You'll be expected to work a 40-hour week
but there may be opportunities to do overtime during busy periods.
Although you're not required to do this,
it can be a valuable experience -
so we advise you to take it up if possible.
Obviously, we understand that people do have commitments outside work,
so don't worry if there are times when you are unavailable.
As you know, we don't have a formal dress code here -
you may wear casual clothes as long as they're practical -
and the only restriction for shoes we have is on high heels for health and safety reasons.
Comfortable shoes like trainers are preferable.
There's a heavily subsidised canteen on site where you can get hot meals or salads cheaply.
Snacks and drinks are also provided -
so we've decided to introduce a no packed lunch policy.
This is partly to encourage healthy eating at work
and partly to stop people from eating at their workstation, which is unhygienic.
OK moving on to‚Ä¶

1072,Cam14 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam14---test-1---part-3,86,"OK, so what I'd like you to do now is to talk to your partner about your presentations on urban planning.
You should have done most of the reading now, so I'd like you to share your ideas,
and talk about the structure of your presentation and what you need to do next.
OK Rob.
I'm glad we chose quite a specific topic - cities built next to the sea.
It made it much easier to find relevant information.
Yeah. And cities are growing so quickly -
I mean, we know that more than half the world's population lives in cities now.
Yeah, though that's all cities, not just ones on the coast.
But most of the biggest cities are actually built by the sea.
I'd not realised that before.
Nor me.
And what's more, a lot of them are built at places where rivers come out into the sea.
But apparently this can be a problem.
Why?
Well, as the city expands,
agriculture and industry tend to spread further inland along the rivers,
and so agriculture moves even further inland up the river.
That's not necessarily a problem,
except it means more and more pollutants are discharged into the rivers.
So these are brought downstream to the cities?
Right.
Did you read that article about Miami, on the east coast of the USA?
No.
Well, apparently back in the 1950s,
they built channels to drain away the water in case of flooding.
Sounds sensible.
Yeah, they spent quite a lot of money on them.
But what they didn't take into account was global warming.
So they built the drainage channels too close to sea level,
and now sea levels are rising, they're more or less useless.
If there's a lot of rain, the water can't run away, there's nowhere for it to go.
The whole design was faulty.
So what are the authorities doing about it now?
I don't know.
I did read that they're aiming to stop disposing of waste water into the ocean over the next ten years.
But that won't help with flood prevention now, will it?
No. Really they just need to find the money for something to replace the drainage channels,
in order to protect against flooding now.
But in the long term they need to consider the whole ecosystem.
Right.
Really, though, coastal cities can't deal with their problems on their own, can they?
I mean, they've got to start acting together at an international level instead of just doing their own thing.
Absolutely.
The thing is, everyone knows what the problems are
and environmentalists have a pretty good idea of what we should be doing about them,
so they should be able to work together to some extent.
But it's going to be a long time before countries come to a decision on what principles they're prepared to abide by.
Yeah, if they ever do.
So I think we've probably got enough for our presentation.
It's only fifteen minutes.
OK.
So I suppose we'll begin with some general historical background
about why coastal cities were established.
But we don't want to spend too long on that,
the other students will already know a bit about it.
It's all to do with communications and so on.
Yes.
We should mention some geographical factors,
things like wetlands and river estuaries and coastal erosion and so on.
We could have some maps of different cities with these features marked.
On a handout you mean?
Or some slides everyone can see?
Yeah, that'd be better.
It'd be good to go into past mistakes in a bit more detail.
Did you read that case study of the problems there were in New Orleans with flooding a few years ago?
Yes, We could use that as the basis for that part of the talk.
I don't think the other students will have read it,
but they'll remember hearing about the flooding at the time.
OK.
So that's probably enough background.
So then we'll go on to talk about what action's being taken to deal with the problems of coastal cities.
OK.
What else do we need to talk about?
Maybe something on future risks, looking more at the long term, if populations continue to grow.
Yeah.
We'll need to do a bit of work there,
I haven't got much information, have you?
No. We'll need to look at some websites.
Shouldn't take too long.
OK.
And I think we should end by talking about international implications.
Maybe we could ask people in the audience.
We've got people from quite a lot of different places.
That'd be interesting, if we have time, yes.
So now‚Ä¶

1073,Cam14 - Test 1 - Part 4,C1,cam14---test-1---part-4,77,"Producing enough energy to meet our needs has become a serious problem.
Demand is rising rapidly,
because of the world's increasing population and expanding industry.
Burning fossil fuels, like gas, coal and oil,
seriously damages the environment
and they'll eventually run out.
For a number of years now,
scientists have been working out how we can derive energy from renewable sources,
such as the sun and wind, without causing pollution.
Today I'll outline marine renewable energy - also called ocean energy -
which harnesses the movement of the oceans.
Marine renewable energy can be divided into three main categories:
wave energy, tidal energy and ocean thermal energy conversion,
and I'll say a few words about each one.
First, wave energy.
Numerous devices have been invented to harvest wave energy,
with names such as Wave Dragon, the Penguin and Mighty Whale,
and research is going on to try and come up with a really efficient method.
This form of energy has plenty of potential, as the source is constant,
and there's no danger of waves coming to a standstill.
Electricity can be generated using onshore systems,
using a reservoir, or offshore systems.
But the problem with ocean waves is that they're erratic,
with the winds making them travel in every direction.
This adds to the difficulty of creating efficient technology:
ideally all the waves would travel smoothly and regularly along the same straight line.
Another drawback is that sand and other sediment on the ocean floor
might be stopped from flowing normally,
which can lead to environmental problems.
The second category of marine energy that I'll mention is tidal energy.
One major advantage of using the tide, rather than waves, as a source of energy
is that it's predictable:
we know the exact times of high and low tides for years to come.
For tidal energy to be effective,
the difference between high and low tides needs to be at least five metres,
and this occurs naturally in only about forty places on Earth.
But the right conditions can be created by constructing a tidal lagoon,
an area of sea water separated from the sea.
One current plan is to create a tidal lagoon on the coast of Wales.
This will be an area of water within a bay at Swansea,
sheltered by a U-shaped breakwater, or dam, built out from the coast.
The breakwater will contain sixteen hydro turbines,
and as the tide rises, water rushes through the breakwater,
activating the turbines, which turn a generator to produce electricity.
Then, for three hours as the tide goes out,
the water is held back within the breakwater,
increasing the difference in water level,
until it's several metres higher within the lagoon than in the open sea.
Then, in order to release the stored water,
gates in the breakwater are opened.
It pours powerfully out of the lagoon,
driving the turbines in the breakwater in the opposite direction
and again generating thousands of megawatts of electricity.
As there are two high tides a day,
this lagoon scheme would generate electricity four times a day, every day,
for a total of around 14 hours in every 24,
and enough electricity for over 150,000 homes.
This system has quite a lot in its favour:
unlike solar and wind energy it doesn't depend on the weather;
the turbines are operated without the need for fuel,
so it doesn't create any greenhouse gas emissions;
and very little maintenance is needed.
It's estimated that electricity generated in this way will be relatively cheap,
and that manufacturing the components would create more than 2,000 jobs,
a big boost to the local economy.
On the other hand,
there are fears that lagoons might harm both fish and birds,
for example by disturbing migration patterns,
and causing a build-up of silt, affecting local ecosystems.
There are other forms of tidal energy,
but I'll go on to the third category of marine energy:
ocean thermal energy conversion.
This depends on there being a big difference in temperature
between surface water and the water a couple of kilometres below the surface,
and this occurs in tropical coastal areas.
The idea is to bring cold water up to the surface using a submerged pipe.
The concept dates back to 1881...

Thank you.
My name's Carl Rogers and I'm one of the doctors here at the Total Health Clinic.
So I understand this is your first visit to the clinic?
Yes, it is.
OK, well I hope you'll be very happy with the service you receive here.
So if it's alright with you I'll take a few details to help me give you the best possible service.
Sure.
So can I check first of all that we have the correct personal details for you?
So your full name is Julie Anne Garcia?
That's correct.
Perfect. And can I have a contact phone number?
It's 2194429785.
OK, and then can I just check that we have the correct date of birth?
October 10th, 1992.
Oh, I actually have 1991,
I'll just correct that now.
Right, so that's all good.
Now I just need a few more personal details‚Ä¶
do you have an occupation, either full-time or part-time?
Yes, I work full-time in Esterhazy's -
you know, the restaurant chain.
I started off as a waitress there a few years ago and I'm a manager now.
Oh I know them, yeah, they're down on 114th Street, aren't they?
That's right.
Yeah, I've been there a few times.
I just love their salads.
That's good to hear.
Right, so one more thing I need to know before we talk about why you're here, Julie,
and that's the name of your insurance company.
It's Cawley Life Insurance,
that's CAWLEY.
Excellent, thank you so much.
Now Julie, let's look at how we can help you.
So tell me a little about what brought you here today.
Well, I've been getting a pain in my knee, the left one.
Not very serious at first, but it's gotten worse,
so I thought I ought to see someone about it.
That's certainly the right decision.
So how long have you been aware of this pain?
Is it just a few days, or is it longer than that?
Longer.
It's been worse for the last couple of days,
but it's three weeks since I first noticed it.
It came on quite gradually though, so I kind of ignored it at first.
And have you taken any medication yourself, or treated it in any way?
Um.. yeah, I've been taking medication to deal with the pain... Tylenol
and that works OK for a few hours.
But I don't like to keep taking it.
OK. And what about heat treatment?
Have you tried applying heat at all?
No, but I have been using ice on it for the last few days.
And does that seem to help the pain at all?
A little, yes.
Good.
Now you look as if you're quite fit normally?
I am, yes.
So do you do any sport on a regular basis?
Yes, I play a lot of tennis.
I belong to a club so I go there a lot.
I'm quite competitive so I enjoy that side of it as well as the exercise.
But I haven't gone since this started.
Sure.
And do you do any other types of exercise?
Yeah, I sometimes do a little swimming,
but usually just when I'm on vacation.
But normally I go running a few times a week, maybe three or four times.
Hmm. So your legs are getting quite a pounding.
But you haven't had any problems up to now?
No, not with my legs.
I did have an accident last year when I slipped and hurt my shoulder,
but that's better now.
Excellent.
And do you have any allergies?
No, none that I'm aware of.
And do you take any medication on a regular basis?
Well, I take vitamins but that's all.
I'm generally very healthy.
OK, well let's have a closer look and see what might be causing this problem.
If you can just get up‚Ä¶

1075,Cam14 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam14---test-2---part-2,69,"We'll be arriving at Branley Castle in about five minutes,
but before we get there I'll give you a little information about the castle and what our visit will include.
So in fact there's been a castle on this site for over 1100 years.
The first building was a fort constructed in 914 AD
for defence against Danish invaders by King Alfred the Great's daughter,
who ruled England at the time.
In the following century, after the Normans conquered England,
the land was given to a nobleman called Richard de Vere,
and he built a castle there that stayed in the de Vere family for over 400 years.
However, when Queen Elizabeth I announced that she was going to visit the castle in 1576
it was beginning to look a bit run down,
and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms,
they'd make a new house for her out of wood next to the main hall.
She stayed there for four nights and apparently it was very luxurious,
but unfortunately it was destroyed a few years later by fire.
In the seventeenth century the castle belonged to the wealthy Fenys family,
who enlarged it and made it more comfortable.
However, by 1982 the Fenys family could no longer afford to maintain the castle,
even though they received government support, and they put it on the market.
It was eventually taken over by a company who owned a number of amusement parks,
but when we get there I think you'll see that they've managed to retain the original atmosphere of the castle.
When you go inside, you'll find that in the state rooms
there are life-like moving wax models dressed in costumes of different periods in the past,
which even carry on conversations together.
As well as that, in every room there are booklets giving information about what the room was used for
and the history of the objects and furniture it contains.
The castle park's quite extensive.
At one time sheep were kept there,
and in the nineteenth century the owners had a little zoo with animals like rabbits
and even a baby elephant.
Nowadays the old zoo buildings are used for public displays of paintings and sculpture.
The park also has some beautiful trees,
though the oldest of all, which dated back 800 years,
was sadly blown down in 1987.
Now, you're free to wander around on your own until 4.30
but then at the end of our visit
we'll all meet together at the bottom of the Great Staircase.
We'll then go on to the long gallery,
where there's a wonderful collection of photographs showing the family who owned the castle a hundred years ago
having tea and cakes in the conservatory -
and we'll then take you to the same place,
where afternoon tea will be served to you.
Now if you can take a look at your plans you'll see Branley Castle has four towers,
joined together by a high wall, with the river on two sides.
Don't miss seeing the Great Hall.
That's near the river in the main tower, the biggest one,
which was extended and redesigned in the eighteenth century.
If you want to get a good view of the whole castle, you can walk around the walls.
The starting point's quite near the main entrance -
walk straight down the path until you get to the south gate, and it's just there.
Don't go on to the north gate - there's no way up from there.
There'll shortly be a show in which you can see archers displaying their skill with a bow and arrow.
The quickest way to get there is to take the first left after the main entrance
and follow the path past the bridge,
then you'll see it in front of you at the end.
If you like animals there's also a display of hunting birds -
falcons and eagles and so on.
If you go from the main entrance in the direction of the south gate,
but turn right before you get there instead of going through it,
you'll see it on your right past the first tower.
At 3 pm there's a short performance of traditional dancing on the outdoor stage.
That's right at the other side of the castle from the entrance, and over the bridge.
It's about ten minutes' walk or so.
And finally, the shop
It's actually inside one of the towers,
but the way in is from the outside.
Just take the first left after the main entrance, go down the path and take the first right.
It's got some lovely gifts and souvenirs.
Right, so we're just arriving‚Ä¶

1076,Cam14 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam14---test-2---part-3,85,"So, Rosie and Martin,
let's look at what you've got for your presentation on woolly mammoths.
OK, we've got a short outline here.
Thanks.
So it's about a research project in North America?
Yes.
But we thought we needed something general about woolly mammoths in our introduction,
to establish that they were related to our modern elephant,
and they lived thousands of years ago in the last ice age.
Maybe we could show a video clip of a cartoon about mammoths.
But that'd be a bit childish.
Or we could have a diagram,
it could be a timeline to show when they lived, with illustrations?
Or we could just show a drawing of them walking in the ice?
No, let's go with your last suggestion.
Good.
Then you're describing the discovery of the mammoth tooth on St Paul's Island in Alaska,
and why it was significant.
Yes.
The tooth was found by a man called Russell Graham.
He picked it up from under a rock in a cave.
He knew it was special -
for a start it was in really good condition,
as if it had been just extracted from the animal's jawbone.
Anyway, they found it was 6,500 years old.
So why was that significant?
Well the mammoth bones previously found on the North American mainland were much less recent than that.
So this was really amazing.
Then we're making an animated diagram to show the geography of the area in prehistoric times.
So originally, St Paul's Island wasn't an island,
it was connected to the mainland,
and mammoths and other animals like bears were able to roam around the whole area.
Then the climate warmed up and the sea level began to rise,
and the island got cut off from the mainland.
So those mammoths on the island couldn't escape;
they had to stay on the island.
And in fact the species survived there for thousands of years
after they'd become extinct on the mainland.
So why do you think they died out on the mainland?
No one's sure.
Anyway, next we'll explain how Graham and his team identified the date when the mammoths became extinct on the island.
They concluded that the extinction happened 5,600 years ago,
which is a very precise time for a prehistoric extinction.
It's based on samples they took from mud at the bottom of a lake on the island.
They analysed it to find out what had fallen in over time -
bits of plants, volcanic ash and even DNA from the mammoths themselves.
It's standard procedure, but it took nearly two years to do.
So why don't you quickly go through the main sections of your presentation
and discuss what action's needed for each part?
OK.
So for the introduction, we're using a visual,
so once we've prepared that we're done.
I'm not sure.
I think we need to write down all the ideas we want to include here,
not just rely on memory.
How we begin the presentation is so important‚Ä¶
Umm, you're right.
The discovery of the mammoth tooth is probably the most dramatic part,
but we don't have that much information,
only what we got from the online article.
I thought maybe we could get in touch with the researcher who led the team
and ask him to tell us a bit more.
Great idea.
What about the section with the initial questions asked by the researchers?
We've got a lot on that but we need to make it interesting.
We could ask the audience to suggest some questions about it
and then see how many of them we can answer.
I don't think it would take too long.
Yes that would add a bit of variety.
Then the section on further research carried out on the island - analysing the mud in the lake.
I wonder if we've actually got too much information here,
should we cut some?
I don't think so,
but it's all a bit muddled at present.
Yes, maybe it would be better if it followed a chronological pattern.
I think so.
The findings and possible explanations section is just about ready,
but we need to practice it so we're sure it won't overrun.
I think it should be OK,
but yes, let's make sure.
In the last section, relevance to the present day,
you've got some good ideas but...
this is where you need to move away from the ideas of others and give your own viewpoint.
OK, we'll think about that.
Now shall we‚Ä¶

1077,Cam14 - Test 2 - Part 4,C1,cam14---test-2---part-4,70,"In this series of lectures about the history of weather forecasting,
I'll start by examining its early history -
that'll be the subject of today's talk.
Ok, so we'll start by going back thousands of years.
Most ancient cultures had weather gods,
and weather catastrophes, such as floods,
played an important role in many creation myths.
Generally, weather was attributed to the whims of the gods,
as the wide range of weather gods in various cultures shows.
For instance, there's the Egyptian sun god Ra,
and Thor, the Norse god of thunder and lightning.
Many ancient civilisations developed rites such as dances
in order to make the weather gods look kindly on them.
But the weather was of daily importance:
observing the skies and drawing the correct conclusions from these observations was really important,
in fact their survival depended on it.
It isn't known when people first started to observe the skies,
but at around 650 BC,
the Babylonians produced the first short-range weather forecasts,
based on their observations of clouds and other phenomena.
The Chinese also recognised weather patterns,
and by 300 BC,
astronomers had developed a calendar which divided the year into 24 festivals,
each associated with a different weather phenomenon.
The ancient Greeks were the first to develop a more scientific approach to explaining the weather.
The work of the philosopher and scientist Aristotle, in the fourth century BC, is especially noteworthy,
as his ideas held sway for nearly 2,000 years.
In 340 BC,
he wrote a book in which he attempted to account for the formation of rain, clouds, wind and storms.
He also described celestial phenomena such as haloes -
that is, bright circles of light around the sun, the moon and bright stars - and comets.
Many of his observations were surprisingly accurate.
For example, he believed that heat could cause water to evaporate.
But he also jumped to quite a few wrong conclusions,
such as that winds are breathed out by the Earth.
Errors like this were rectified from the Renaissance onwards.
For nearly 2,000 years,
Aristotle's work was accepted as the chief authority on weather theory.
Alongside this, though, in the Middle Ages,
weather observations were passed on in the form of proverbs,
such as 'Red sky at night, shepherd's delight; red sky in the morning, shepherd's warning'.
Many of these are based on very good observations and are accurate,
as contemporary meteorologists have discovered.
For centuries, any attempt to forecast the weather could only be based on personal observations,
but in the fifteenth century scientists began to see the need for instruments.
Until then, the only ones available were weathervanes - to determine the wind direction -
and early versions of rain gauges.
One of the first, invented in the fifteenth century, was a hygrometer, which measured humidity.
This was one of many inventions that contributed to the development of weather forecasting.
In 1592, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo developed the world's first thermometer.
His student Torricelli later invented the barometer,
which allowed people to measure atmospheric pressure.
In 1648, the French philosopher Pascal proved that pressure decreases with altitude.
This discovery was verified by English astronomer Halley in 1686,
and Halley was also the first person to map trade winds.
This increasing ability to measure factors related to weather
helped scientists to understand the atmosphere and its processes better,
and they started collecting weather observation data systematically.
In the 18th century, the scientist and politician Benjamin Franklin
carried out work on electricity and lightning in particular,
but he was also very interested in weather and studied it throughout most of his life.
It was Franklin who discovered that storms generally travel from west to east.
In addition to new meteorological instruments,
other developments contributed to our understanding of the atmosphere.
People in different locations began to keep records,
and in the mid-nineteenth century,
the invention of the telegraph made it possible for these records to be collated.
This led, by the end of the nineteenth century, to the first weather services.
It was not until the early twentieth century that mathematics and physics became part of meteorology,
and we'll continue from that point next week.

Oh, hi. I wanted to ask about conference facilities at the hotel.
Have I come through to the right person?
Hmm... You have. I'm the customer services manager.
My name's Angela.
So how can I help you?
Well, I'm calling from Barrett and Stansons,
we're a medical company based in Perth.
Oh yes.
And we're organising a conference for our clients to be held in Sydney.
It'll be held over two days and we're expecting about fifty or sixty people.
When were you thinking of having it?
Some time early next year, like the end of January?
It'd have to be a weekend.
Ah... let me see‚Ä¶
our conference facilities are already booked for the weekend beginning January the 28th.
We could do the first weekend in February?
How about January the 21st?
Oh.. I'm afraid that's booked too.
Well, let's go for the February date then.
So that's the weekend beginning the 4th.
OK.
Now can you tell me a bit about what conference facilities you have?
Sure.
So for talks and presentations we have the Tesla room.
Sorry?
Tesla - that's spelled TESLA.
it holds up to a hundred people,
and it's fully equipped with a projector and so on.
How about a microphone?
Yes, that'll be all set up ready for you,
and there'll be one that members of the audience can use too, for questions, if necessary.
Fine.
And we'll also need some sort of open area where people can sit and have a cup of coffee,
and we'd like to have an exhibition of our products and services there as well,
so that'll need to be quite a big space.
That's fine,
there's a central atrium with all those facilities,
and you can come before the conference starts if you want to set everything up.
Great.
And I presume there's wifi?
Oh yes, that's free and available throughout the hotel.
OK.
Would you also like us to provide a buffet lunch?
We can do a two-course meal with a number of different options.
What sort of price are we looking at for that?
Well, I can send you a copy of the standard menu.
That's $45 per person.
Or you can have the special for $25 more.
I think the standard should be OK, but yes, send me the menu.
Now we're also going to need accommodation on the Saturday night for some of the participants‚Ä¶
I'm not sure how many, but probably about 25.
So what do you charge for a room?
Well, for conference attendees we have a 25% reduction,
so we can offer you rooms at $135.
Normally a standard room's $180.
And does that include breakfast?
Sure.
And of course, guests can also make use of all the other facilities at the hotel.
So we've got a spa where you can get massages and facials and so on,
and there's a pool up on the roof for the use of guests.
Ah... great.
Now what about transport links?
The hotel's downtown, isn't it?
Yes, it's about 12 kilometres from the airport,
but there's a complimentary shuttle bus for guests.
And it's only about ten minutes' walk from the central railway station.
OK.
Now, I don't know Sydney very well,
can you just give me an idea of the location of the hotel?
Ah... well, it's downtown on Wilby Street,
ah... that's quite a small street, and it's not very far from the sea.
And of course if the conference attendees want to go out on the Saturday evening,
there's a huge choice of places to eat.
Then if they want to make a night of it,
they can go on to one of the clubs in the area -
there are a great many to choose from.
OK.
So if we go ahead with this,
Can you give me some information about how much‚Ä¶

1079,Cam14 - Test 3 - Part 2,B1,cam14---test-3---part-2,61,"Good morning.
My name's Lucy Crittenden,
and I'm the Director of Operations for an organisation that arranges volunteering in this part of the country.
I'm hoping I can persuade one or two of you to become volunteers yourselves.
Let me start by briefly explaining what we mean by volunteering.
Volunteers are teenagers and adults who choose to spend some time, unpaid, helping other people in some way.
Most volunteers devote two or three hours to this every week, while a few do much more.
The people they help may have physical or behavioural difficulties, for example.
Volunteers can do all sorts of things, depending on their own abilities and interests.
If they're supporting a family that's struggling, for example,
they may be able to give them tips on cooking,
or recommend how to plan their budget
or how to shop sensibly on their income.
They might even do some painting or wallpapering,
perhaps alongside any members of the family who are able to do it.
Or even do some babysitting so that parents can go out for a while.
The benefit from volunteering isn't only for the people being helped.
Volunteers also gain from it:
they're using their skills to cope with somebody's mental or physical ill health,
and volunteering may be a valuable element of their CV when they're applying for jobs:
employers usually look favourably on someone who's given up time to help others.
Significantly, most volunteers feel that what they're doing gives them a purpose in their lives.
And in my opinion, they're lucky in that respect,
as many people don't have that feeling.
Now I'd like to tell you what some of our volunteers have said about what they do,
to give you an idea of the range of ways in which they can help people.
Habib supports an elderly lady who's beginning to show signs of dementia.
Once a week they, along with other elderly people, go to the local community centre,
where a group of people come in and sing.
The songs take the listeners back to their youth,
and for a little while they can forget the difficulties that they face now.
Our volunteer Consuela is an amazing woman.
She has difficulty walking herself, but she doesn't let that stop her.
She helps a couple of people with similar difficulties,
who had almost stopped walking altogether.
By using herself as an example,
Consuela encourages them to walk more and more.
Minh visits a young man who lives alone and can't leave his home on his own,
so he hardly ever saw anyone.
But together they go out to the cinema,
or to see friends the young man hadn't been able to visit for a long time.
Tanya visits an elderly woman once a week.
When the woman found out that Tanya is a professional dressmaker, she got interested.
Tanya showed her some soft toys she'd made,
and the woman decided to try it herself.
And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours making toys.
They're not perhaps up to Tanya's standard yet,
but she gains a lot of pleasure from doing it.
Alexei is a volunteer with a family that faces a number of difficulties.
By calmly talking over possible solutions with family members,
he's helping them to realise that they aren't helpless,
and that they can do something themselves to improve their situation.
This has been great for their self-esteem.
And the last volunteer I'll mention, though there are plenty more, is Juba.
She volunteers with a teenage girl with learning difficulties,
who wasn't very good at talking to other people.
Juba's worked very patiently with her,
and now the girl is far better at expressing herself,
and at understanding other people.
OK, I hope that's given you an idea of what volunteering is all about.
Now I'd like‚Ä¶

1080,Cam14 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam14---test-3---part-3,70,"So how are you getting on with your teaching practice at the High School, Joe?
Well I've been put in charge of the school marching band, and it's quite a responsibility.
I'd like to talk it over with you.
Go ahead.
You'd better start by giving me a bit of background.
OK.
Well the band has students in it from all years,
so they're aged 11 to 18, and there are about 50 of them altogether.
It's quite a popular activity within the school.
I've never worked with a band of more than 20 before, and this is very different.
I can imagine.
They aren't really good enough to enter national band competitions,
but they're in a regional one later in the term.
Even if they don't win, and I don't expect them to,
hopefully it'll be an incentive for them to try and improve.
Yes, hopefully.
Well, now the town council's organising a carnival in the summer,
and the band has been asked to perform.
If you ask me, they aren't really up to it yet,
and I need to get them functioning better as a band, and in a very short time.
Have you been doing anything with them?
Apart from practising the music, I mean.
I played a recording I came across,
of a drummer talking about how playing in a band had changed his life.
I think it was an after-dinner speech.
I thought it was pretty inspiring,
because being in the band had stopped him from getting involved in crime.
The students seemed to find it interesting, too.
That's good.
I'm planning to show them that old film from the 1940s 'Strike Up the Band',
and talk about it with the students.
What do you think?
Good idea.
As it's about a school band, it might make the students realise how much they can achieve if they work together.
That's what I've got in mind.
I'm hoping I can take some of the band to a parade that's going to take place next month.
A couple of marching bands will be performing, and the atmosphere should be quite exciting.
It depends on whether I can persuade the school to hire a coach or two to take us there.
They sound like good ideas to me.
Thanks.
Can I tell you about a few people in the band who I'm finding it quite difficult to cope with?
I'm sure you'll have some ideas about what I can do.
Go ahead.
There's a flautist who says she loves playing in the band.
We rehearse twice a week after school, but she's hardly ever there.
Then she looks for me the next day and gives me a very plausible reason -
she says she had to help her mother, or she's been ill,
but to be honest, I don't believe her.
Oh dear!
Any more students with difficulties?
Plenty!
There's a trumpeter who thinks she's the best musician in the band, though she certainly isn't.
She's always saying what she thinks other people should do, which makes my job pretty difficult.
She sounds a bit of a nightmare!
You can say that again.
Uh... one of the trombonists has got an impressive sense of rhythm,
and could be an excellent musician -
except that he has breathing difficulties,
and he doesn't really have enough breath for the trombone.
He'd be much better off playing percussion, for instance, but he refuses to give up.
So he ends up only playing half the notes.
I suppose you have to admire his determination.
Maybe.
One of the percussionists isn't too bad,
but he never seems to interact with other people,
and he always rushes off as soon as the rehearsal ends.
I don't know if there are family reasons, or what.
But it isn't good in a band, where people really need to feel they're part of a group.
There are others too, but at least that gives you an idea of what I'm up against.
Do you have any thoughts about what I can do, Lizzie?

1081,Cam14 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam14---test-3---part-4,70,"As you all know, the university is planning an arts festival for later this year,
and here in the music department we've planned three concerts.
These will be public performances, and the programme has just been finalised.
The theme of the festival is links between the UK and Australia,
and this is reflected in the music:
each concert will feature both British and Australian composers.
I'll tell you briefly about the Australian music,
as you probably won't be familiar with that.
The first concert will include music by Liza Lim,
who was born in Perth, Western Australia, in 1966.
As a child, Lim originally learned to play the piano - like so many children -
and also the violin.
But when she was 11 her teachers encouraged her to start composing.
She found this was her real strength,
and she studied and later taught composition,
both in Australia and in other countries.
As a composer, she has received commissions from numerous orchestras,
other performers and festivals in several countries.
Liza Lim's compositions are vibrant and full of energy,
and she often explores Asian and Australian Aboriginal cultural sources,
including the native instrument, the didgeridoo:
this is featured in a work called The Compass.
Her music is very expressive,
so although it is complex,
it has the power of connecting with audiences and performers alike.
In the festival we're going to give a semi-staged performance of The Oresteia.
This is an opera in seven parts,
based on the trilogy of ancient Greek tragedies by Aeschylus.
Lim composed this when she was in her mid-20s,
and she also wrote the text, along with Barrie Kosky.
It's performed by six singers, a dancer,
and an orchestra that, as well as standard orchestral instruments, includes electric guitar,
and a traditional Turkish stringed instrument.
Lim wrote that because the stories in the tragedies are not easy to tell,
the sounds she creates are also disturbing,
and they include breathing, sobbing, laughing and whistling.
The work lasts around 75 minutes,
and the rest of the concert will consist of orchestral works by the British composers
Ralph Vaughan Williams and Frederick Delius.
Moving on now to our second concert,
this will begin with instrumental music by British composers - Benjamin Britten and Judith Weir.
After the interval we'll go to Australia for a piece by Ross Edwards:
The Tower of Remoteness.
According to Edwards, the inspiration for this piece came from nature,
when he was sitting alone in the dry bed of a creek,
overshadowed by the leaves of palm trees,
listening to the birds and insects.
The Tower of Remoteness is scored for piano and clarinet.
Edwards says he realised years after writing the piece
that he had subconsciously modelled its opening phrase on a bird call.
Ross Edwards was born in 1943 in Sydney, Australia,
and studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music
and the universities of Adelaide and Sydney.
He's well known in Australia,
and in fact he's one of the country's most performed composers.
He's written a wide range of music,
from symphonies and concertos to some composed specifically for children.
Edwards's music has been described as being 'deeply connected to Australia',
and it can be regarded as a celebration of the diversity of cultures that Australia can be proud of.
The last of the three Australian composers to be represented in our festival is Carl Vine.
Born in 1954, Vine, like Liza Lim, comes from Perth, Western Australia.
He took up the cornet at the age of five, switching to the piano five years later.
However, he went to university to study physics, before changing to composition.
After graduating he moved to Sydney and worked as a freelance pianist and composer.
Before long he had become prominent in Australia as a composer for dance,
and in fact has written 25 scores of that type.
In our third concert,
Vine will be represented by his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the Olympics held in 1996.
This seven-minute orchestral piece was of course heard by millions of people worldwide,
and we'll hear it alongside works written by British composers Edward Elgar and, more recently, Thomas Ad√®s.

1082,Cam14 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam14---test-4---part-1,76,"Good morning, Clare House Hotel.
Andrew speaking.
I'm the Events Manager.
Good morning, Andrew.
My name's Samantha.
I'm arranging a party for my parents' fiftieth wedding anniversary,
and I'm ringing to ask about hiring a room some time next September.
Also my parents and several of the guests will need accommodation.
OK, I'm sure we can help you with that.
Will you be having a sit-down meal or a buffet?
Probably a sit-down.
And do you know how many people there'll be?
Around eighty, I think.
Well we have two rooms that can hold that number.
One is the Adelphi Room.
That can seat 85, or hold over a hundred if people are standing for a buffet.
Right.
If you have live music, there's room for four or five musicians in the gallery overlooking the room.
Our guests usually appreciate the fact that the music can be loud enough for dancing,
but not too loud for conversation.
Yes, I really don't like it when you can't talk.
Exactly.
Now the Adelphi Room is at the back of the hotel,
and there are French windows leading out onto the terrace.
This has a beautiful display of pots of roses at that time of the year.
Which direction does it face?
Southwest,
so that side of the hotel gets the sun in the afternoon and early evening.
Very nice.
From the terrace you can see the area of trees within the grounds of the hotel,
or you can stroll through there to the river - that's on the far side,
so it isn't visible from the hotel.
OK.
Then another option is the Carlton Room.
This is a bit bigger - it can hold up to 110 people
and it has the advantage of a stage, which is useful if you have any entertainment,
or indeed a small band can fit onto it.
And can you go outside from the room?
No, the Carlton Room is on the first floor,
but on one side the windows look out onto the lake.
Lovely.
I think either of those rooms would be suitable.
Can I tell you about some of the options we offer in addition?
Please do.
As well as a meal, you can have an MC, a Master of Ceremonies,
who'll be with you throughout the party.
What exactly is the MC's function?
I suppose they make a speech during the meal if we need one, do they?
That's right.
All our MCs are trained as public speakers,
so they can easily get people's attention -
many guests are glad to have someone who can make themselves heard above the chatter!
And they're also your support -
if anything goes wrong, the MC will deal with it, so you can relax.
Great!
I'll need to ask you about food,
but something else that's important is accommodation.
You obviously have rooms in the hotel,
but do you also have any other accommodation, like cabins, for example?
Yes, there are five in the grounds, all self-contained.
They each sleep two to four people and have their own living room, bathroom and small kitchen.
That sounds perfect for what we'll need.
Now you have various facilities, don't you?
Are they all included in the price of hiring the room?
The pool, for instance.
Normally you'd be able to use it,
but it'll be closed throughout September for refurbishment, I'm afraid.
The gym will be available, though, at no extra charge.
That's open all day, from six in the morning until midnight.
Right.
And the tennis courts, but there is a small additional payment for those.
We have four courts, and it's worth booking in advance if you possibly can,
as there can be quite a long waiting list for them!
Right.
Now could we discuss the food?
This would be dinner, around seven o'clock‚Ä¶

1083,Cam14 - Test 4 - Part 2,B1,cam14---test-4---part-2,61,"Hello everyone.
I'm Jake Stevens and I'm your rep here at the hotel.
I'm sure you'll all have a great time here.
So let me tell you a bit about what's on offer.
I'll start by telling you about some of the excursions that are available for guests.
One thing you have to do while you're here is go dolphin watching.
On our boat trips, we pretty well guarantee you'll see dolphins -
if you don't you can repeat the trip free of charge.
We organise daily trips for just 35 euros.
Unfortunately there aren't any places left for this afternoon's trip,
but come and see me to book for later in the week.
If you're energetic, I'd recommend our forest walk.
It's a guided walk of about seven kilometres.
There'll be a stop half way, and you'll be provided with a drink and sandwiches.
There's some fairly steep climbs up the hills,
so you need to be reasonably fit for this one,
with good shoes, and bring a waterproof in case it rains.
It's just 25 euros all inclusive, and it's every Wednesday.
Then on Thursdays we organise a cycle trip,
which will give you all the fun of biking without the effort.
We'll take you and your bike up to the top of Mount Larna,
and leave you to bike back -
it's a 700-metre drop in just 20 kilometres
so this isn't really for inexperienced cyclists as you'll be going pretty fast.
And if it's a clear day, you'll have fantastic views.
On our local craft tour you can find out about the traditional activities in the island.
And the best thing about this trip is that it's completely free.
You'll be taken to a factory where jewellery is made, and also a ceramics centre.
If you want, you can buy some of the products but that's entirely up to you.
The trip starts after lunch on Thursday, and you'll return by 6 pm.
If you're interested in astronomy you may already know that the island's one of the best places in the world to observe the night sky.
We can offer trips to the observatory on Friday for those who are interested.
They cost 90 euros per person
and you'll be shown the huge telescopes and have a talk from an expert,
who'll explain all about how they work.
Afterwards we'll head down to Sunset Beach,
where you can have a dip in the ocean if you want before we head off back to the hotel.
Finally, there's horse riding.
This is organised by the Equestrian Centre over near Playa Cortino
and it's a great experience if you're a keen horseback rider,
or even if you've never been on a horse before.
They take you down to the beach,
and you can canter along the sand and through the waves.
It costs 35 euros and it's available every day.
So there's plenty to do in the daytime, but what about night life?
Well, the number one attraction's called 'Musical Favourites'.
Guests enjoy a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks, and watch a fantastic show,
starting with musicals set in Paris and then crossing the Atlantic to Las Vegas
and finally Copacabana.
At the end the cast members come down from the stage, still in their stunning costumes,
and you'll have a chance to chat with them.
It's hugely popular, so let me know now if you're interested because it's no good leaving it until the last minute.
It's on Friday night.
Tickets are just 50 euros each, but for an extra 10 euros you can have a table right by the stage.
If you'd like to go back in time, there's the Castle Feast on Saturday evening.
It's held in a twelfth-century castle, and you eat in the great courtyard,
with ladies in long gowns serving your food.
You're given a whole chicken each, which you eat in the medieval way, using your hands instead of cutlery,
and you're entertained by competitions where the horseback riders attempt to knock one another off their horses.
Then you can watch the dancers in the ballroom and join in as well if you want.
OK, so now if anyone‚Ä¶

1084,Cam14 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam14---test-4---part-3,85,"Hello, Trevor.
Hello, Stephanie.
You said you wanted to talk about the course I'm taking on literature for children.
That's right.
I'm thinking of doing it next year, but I'd like to find out more about it first.
OK, well, as you probably know, it's a one-year course.
It's divided into six modules, and you have to take all of them.
One of the most interesting ones, for me, at least,
was about the purpose of children's literature.
You mean, whether it should just entertain children or should be educational, as well.
Right, and whether the teaching should be factual - giving them information about the world - or ethical, teaching them values.
What's fascinating is that the writer isn't necessarily conscious of the message they're conveying.
For instance, a story might show a child who has a problem as a result of not doing what an adult has told them to do,
implying that children should always obey adults.
Ah... I see what you mean.
That module made me realise how important stories are -
they can have a significant effect on children as they grow up.
Actually, it inspired me to have a go at it myself, just for my own interest.
I know I can't compete with the really popular stories, like the Harry Potter books - they're very good,
and even young kids like my seven-year-old niece love reading them.
I'm very interested in illustrations in stories.
Is that covered in the course?
Yes, there's a module on pictures,
and how they're sometimes central to the story.
Mm.. that's good.
I remember some frightening ones I saw as a child and I can still see them vividly in my mind, years later!
Pictures can be so powerful, just as powerful as words.
I've always enjoyed drawing, so that's the field I want to go into when I finish the course.
I bet that module will be really helpful.
I'm sure it will.
We also studied comics in that module,
but I'm not convinced of their value, not compared with books.
One of the great things about words is that you use your imagination,
but with a comic you don't have to.
But children are so used to visual input - on TV, video games, and so on.
There are plenty of kids who wouldn't even try to read a book,
so I think comics can serve a really useful purpose.
You mean, it's better to read a comic than not to read at all?
Yes, I suppose you're right.
I just think its sad when children don't read books.
What about books for girls and books for boys?
Does the course go into that?
Yes, there's a module on it.
For years, lots of stories, in English, at least, assumed that boys went out and did adventurous things
and girls stayed at home and played with dolls.
I was amazed how many books were targeted at just one sex or the other.
Of course this reflects society as it is when the books are written.
That's true.
So it sounds as though you think it's a good course.
Definitely.
Have you been reading lots of children's stories, to help you decide whether to take the course?
Yeah. I've gone as far back as the late seventeenth century,
though I know there were earlier children's stories.
So does that mean you've read Perrault's fairy tales?
Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty, and so on.
Yes!
They must be important, because no stories of that type had been written before,
these were the first.
Then there's The Swiss Family Robinson.
I haven't read that.
The English name makes it sound as though Robinson is the family's surname,
but a more accurate translation would be The Swiss Robinsons,
because it's about a Swiss family who are shipwrecked,
like Robinson Crusoe in the novel of a century earlier.
Well I never knew that!
Have you read Hoffmann's The Nutcracker and the Mouse King?
Wasn't that the basis for Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker?
That's right.
It has some quite bizarre elements.
I hope you've read Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince.
It's probably my favourite children's story of all time.
Oh.. mine too!
And it's so surprising, because Wilde is best known for his plays,
and most of them are very witty, but The Happy Prince is really moving.
I struggled with Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings...
three long books, and I gave up after one.
It's extremely popular, though.
Yeah, but whereas something like The Happy Prince just carried me along with it,
The Lord of the Rings took more effort than I was prepared to give it.
I didn't find that - I love it.
Another one I've read is War Horse.
Oh yes. It's about the First World War, isn't it?
Hardly what you'd expect for a children's story.
Exactly, but it's been very successful.
Have you read any‚Ä¶

1085,Cam14 - Test 4 - Part 4,C1,cam14---test-4---part-4,72,"In today's class I'm going to talk about marine archaeology,
the branch of archaeology focusing on human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers.
It's the study of ships, cargoes, shipping facilities, and other physical remains.
I'll give you an example,
then go on to show how this type of research is being transformed by the use of the latest technology.
Atlit-Yam was a village on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean,
which seems to have been thriving until around 7,000 BC.
The residents kept cattle, caught fish and stored grain.
They had wells for fresh water,
many of their houses were built around a courtyard and were constructed of stone.
The village contained an impressive monument:
seven half-tonne stones standing in a semicircle around a spring,
that might have been used for ceremonial purposes.
Atlit-Yam may have been destroyed swiftly by a tsunami,
or climate change may have caused glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise, flooding the village gradually.
Whatever the cause, it now lies ten metres below the surface of the Mediterranean,
buried under sand at the bottom of the sea.
It's been described as the largest and best preserved prehistoric settlement ever found on the seabed.
For marine archaeologists, Atlit-Yam is a treasure trove.
Research on the buildings, tools and the human remains has revealed how the bustling village once functioned,
and even what diseases some of its residents suffered from.
But of course this is only one small village, one window into a lost world.
For a fuller picture, researchers need more sunken settlements,
but the hard part is finding them.
Underwater research used to require divers to find shipwrecks or artefacts,
but in the second half of the twentieth century, various types of underwater vehicles were developed,
some controlled from a ship on the surface, and some of them autonomous,
which means they don't need to be operated by a person.
Autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs,
are used in the oil industry, for instance, to create maps of the seabed before rigs and pipelines are installed.
To navigate they use sensors, such as compasses and sonar.
Until relatively recently they were very expensive, and so heavy that they had to be launched from a large vessel with a winch.
But the latest AUVs are much easier to manoeuvre -
they can be launched from the shore or a small ship.
And they're much cheaper, which makes them more accessible to research teams.
They're also very sophisticated.
They can communicate with each other and, for example,
work out the most efficient way to survey a site,
or to find particular objects on the seabed.
Field tests show the approach can work.
For example, in a trial in 2015,
three AUVs searched for wrecks at Marzamemi, off the coast of Sicily.
The site is the final resting place of an ancient Roman ship,
which sank in the sixth century AD
while ferrying prefabricated marble elements for the construction of an early church.
The AUVs mapped the area in detail, finding other ships carrying columns of the same material.
Creating an internet in the sea for AUVs to communicate is no easy matter.
Wifi networks on land use electromagnetic waves,
but in water these will only travel a few centimetres.
Instead, a more complex mix of technologies is required.
For short distances, AUVs can share data using light,
while acoustic waves are used to communicate over long distances.
But more creative solutions are also being developed,
where an AUV working on the seabed offloads data to a second AUV,
which then surfaces and beams the data home to the research team using a satellite.
There's also a system that enables AUVs to share information from seabed scans, and other data.
So if an AUV surveying the seabed finds an intriguing object,
it can share the coordinates of the object - that is, its position -
with a nearby AUV that carries superior cameras,
and arrange for that AUV to make a closer inspection of the object.
Marine archaeologists are excited about the huge potential of these AUVs for their discipline.
One site where they're going to be deployed is the Gulf of Baratti, off the Italian coast.
In 1974, a 2,000-year-old Roman vessel was discovered here, in 18 metres of water.
When it sank, it was carrying medical goods, in wooden or tin receptacles.
Its cargo gives us insight into the treatments available all those years ago,
including tablets that are thought to have been dissolved to form a cleansing liquid for the eyes.
Other Roman ships went down nearby, taking their cargoes with them.
Some held huge pots made of terracotta.
Some were used for transporting cargoes of olive oil, and others held wine.
In many cases it's only these containers that remain,
while the wooden ships have been buried under silt on the seabed.
Another project...

1086,Cam13 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam13---test-1---part-1,60,"Hello, Tourist Information Centre, Mike speaking, how can I help you?
Oh, hi.
I wanted to find out about cookery classes.
I believe there are some one-day classes for tourists?
Well, they're open to everyone, but tourists are always welcome.
OK, let me give you some details of what's available.
There are several classes.
One very popular one is at the Food Studio.
OK
They focus on seasonal products,
and as well as teaching you how to cook them, they also show you how to choose them.
Right, that sounds good.
How big are the classes?
I'm not sure exactly, but they'll be quite small.
And could I get a private lesson there?
I think so‚Ä¶ let me check,
yes, they do offer those.
Though in fact most of the people who attend the classes find it's a nice way of getting to know one another.
I suppose it must be, yes.
And this company has a special deal for clients
where they offer a discount of 20% if you return for a further class.
OK.
But you said there were several classes?
That's right.
Another one you might be interested in is Bond's Cookery School.
They're quite new,
they just opened six months ago, but I've heard good things about them.
They concentrate on teaching you to prepare healthy food,
and they have quite a lot of specialist staff.
So is that food for people on a diet and things like that?
I don't know if I'd be interested in that.
Well, I don't think they particularly focus on low calorie diets or weight loss.
It's more to do with recipes that look at specific needs,
like including ingredients that will help build up your bones and make them stronger, that sort of thing.
I see.
Well, I might be interested, I'm not sure.
Do they have a website I could check?
Yes, just key in the name of the school - it'll come up.
And if you want to know more about them, every Thursday evening they have a lecture at the school.
It's free and you don't need to book or anything, just turn up at 7.30.
And that might give you an idea of whether you want to go to an actual class.
OK, there's one more place you might be interested in.
That's got a rather strange name, it's called The Arretsa Centre -
that's spelled ARRETSA.
OK.
They've got a very good reputation.
They do a bit of meat and fish cookery but they mostly specialise in vegetarian dishes.
Right.
That's certainly an area I'd like to learn more about.
I've got lots of friends who don't eat meat.
In fact, I think I might have seen that school today.
Is it just by the market?
That's right.
So they don't have any problem getting their ingredients.
They're right next door.
And they also offer a special two-hour course in how to use a knife.
They cover all the different skills - buying them, sharpening, chopping techniques.
It gets booked up quickly though so you'd need to check it was available.
Right, well thank you very much.
I'll go and‚Ä¶

1087,Cam13 - Test 1 - Part 2,B2,cam13---test-1---part-2,57,"Good evening everyone.
My name's Phil Sutton, and I'm chairman of the Highways Committee.
We've called this meeting to inform members of the public
about the new regulations for traffic and parking we're proposing for Granford.
I'll start by summarising these changes before we open the meeting to questions.
So, why do we need to make these changes to traffic systems in Granford?
Well, we're very aware that traffic is becoming an increasing problem.
It's been especially noticeable with the increase in heavy traffic while they've been building the new hospital.
But it's the overall rise in the volume of traffic of all kinds that's concerning us.
To date there's not been any increase in traffic accidents,
but that's not something we want to see happen, obviously.
We recently carried out a survey of local residents,
and their responses were interesting.
People were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads
due to cars parked along the sides of the roads.
We'd expected complaints about the congestion near the school
when parents are dropping off their children or picking them up,
but this wasn't top of the list,
and nor were noise and fumes from trucks and lorries,
though they were mentioned by some people.
We think these new traffic regulations would make a lot of difference.
But we still have a long way to go.
We've managed to keep our proposals within budget, just, so they can be covered by the Council.
But, of course, it's no good introducing new regulations
if we don't have a way of making sure that everyone obeys them,
and that's an area we're still working on with the help of representatives from the police force.
OK, so this slide shows a map of the central area of Granford,
with the High Street in the middle and School Road on the right.
Now, we already have a set of traffic lights in the High Street at the junction with Station Road,
but we're planning to have another set at the other end, at the School Road junction,
to regulate the flow of traffic along the High Street.
We've decided we definitely need a pedestrian crossing.
We considered putting this on School Road, just outside the school,
but in the end we decided that could lead to a lot of traffic congestion
so we decided to locate it on the High Street, crossing the road in front of the supermarket.
That's a very busy area, so it should help things there.
We're proposing some changes to parking.
At present, parking isn't allowed on the High Street outside the library,
but we're going to change that, and allow parking there,
but not at the other end of the High Street near School Road.
There'll be a new 'No Parking' sign on School Road,
just by the entrance to the school, forbidding parking for 25 metres.
This should improve visibility for drivers and pedestrians,
especially on the bend just to the north of the school.
As far as disabled drivers are concerned,
at present they have parking outside the supermarket,
but lorries also use those spaces,
so we've got two new disabled parking spaces on the side road up towards the bank.
It's not ideal, but probably better than the present arrangement.
We also plan to widen the pavement on School Road.
We think we can manage to get an extra half metre on the bend just before you get to the school,
on the same side of the road.
Finally, we've introduced new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket,
so lorries will only be allowed to stop there before 8 am.
That's the supermarket on School Road -
we kept to the existing arrangements with the High Street supermarket.
OK. So that's about it...

1088,Cam13 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam13---test-1---part-3,75,"We've got to choose a topic for our experiment, haven't we, Jack?
Were you thinking of something to do with seeds?
That's right.
I thought we could look at seed germination - how a seed begins to grow.
OK.
Any particular reason?
I know you're hoping to work in plant science eventually‚Ä¶
Yeah, but practically everything we do is going to feed into that.
No, there's an optional module on seed structure and function in the third year that I might do,
so I thought it might be useful for that.
If I choose that option, I don't have to do a dissertation module.
Good idea.
Hmm... well, I thought for this experiment we could look at the relationship between seed size and the way the seeds are planted.
So, we could plant different sized seeds in different ways, and see which grow best.
OK.
We'd need to allow time for the seeds to come up.
That should be fine if we start now.
A lot of the other possible experiments need quite a bit longer.
So that'd make it a good one to choose.
And I don't suppose it'd need much equipment;
we're not doing chemical analysis or anything.
Though that's not really an issue,
we've got plenty of equipment in the laboratory.
Yeah. We need to have a word with the tutor if we're going to go ahead with it though.
I'm sure our aim's OK.
It's not very ambitious but the assignment's only 10% of our final mark, isn't it?
But we need to be sure we're the only ones doing it.
Yeah, it's only 5% actually,
but it'd be a bit boring if everyone was doing it.
Did you read that book on seed germination on our reading list?
The one by Graves?
I looked through it for my last experiment,
though it wasn't all that relevant there.
It would be for this experiment, though.
I found it quite hard to follow -
lots about the theory, which I hadn't expected
Yes, I'd been hoping for something more practical.
It does include references to the recent findings on genetically-modified seeds, though.
Yes, that was interesting.
I read an article about seed germination by Lee Hall.
About seeds that lie in the ground for ages and only germinate after a fire?
That's the one.
I knew a bit about it already, but not about this research.
His analysis of figures comparing the times of the fires and the proportion of seeds that germinated
was done in a lot of detail - very impressive.
Was that the article with the illustrations of early stages of plant development?
They were very clear.
I think those diagrams were in another article.
Anyway, shall we have a look at the procedure for our experiment?
We'll need to get going with it quite soon.
Right.
So the first thing we have to do is find our seeds.
I think vegetable seeds would be best.
And obviously they mustn't all be the same size.
So, how many sorts do we need?
About four different ones?
I think that would be enough.
There'll be quite a large number of seeds for each one.
Then, for each seed we need to find out how much it weighs,
and also measure its dimensions,
and we need to keep a careful record of all that.
That'll be quite time-consuming.
And we also need to decide how deep we're going to plant the seeds -
right on the surface, a few millimetres down, or several centimetres.
OK.
So then we get planting.
Do you think we can plant several seeds together in the same plant pot?
No, I think we need a different one for each seed.
Hmm... Right. And we'll need to label them.
We can use different coloured labels.
Then we wait for the seeds to germinate.
I reckon that'll be about three weeks, depending on what the weather's like.
Then we see if our plants have come up, and write down how tall they've grown.
Then all we have to do is look at our numbers, and see if there's any relation between them.
That's right...

1089,Cam13 - Test 1 - Part 4,C1,cam13---test-1---part-4,60,"Hi.
Today we're going to be looking at animals in urban environments
and I'm going to be telling you about some research on how they're affected by these environments.
Now, in evolutionary terms,
urban environments represent huge upheavals,
the sorts of massive changes that usually happen over millions of years.
And we used to think that only a few species could adapt to this new environment.
One species which is well known as being highly adaptable is the crow,
and there've been various studies about how they manage to learn new skills.
Another successful species is the pigeon,
because they're able to perch on ledges on the walls of city buildings,
just like they once perched on cliffs by the sea.
But in fact,
we're now finding that these early immigrants were just the start of a more general movement of animals into cities,
and of adaptation by these animals to city life.
And one thing that researchers are finding especially interesting
is the speed with which they're doing this -
we're not talking about gradual evolution here -
these animals are changing fast.
Let me tell you about some of the studies that have been carried out in this area.
So, in the University of Minnesota,
a biologist called Emilie Snell-Rood and her colleagues
looked at specimens of urbanised small mammals such as mice and gophers
that had been collected in Minnesota, and that are now kept in museums there.
And she looked at specimens that had been collected over the last hundred years,
which is a very short time in evolutionary terms.
And she found that during that time,
these small mammals had experienced a jump in brain size when compared to rural mammals.
Now, we can't be sure this means they're more intelligent,
but since the sizes of other parts of the body didn't change,
it does suggest that something cognitive was going on.
And Snell-Rood thinks that this change might reflect the cognitive demands of adjusting to city life -
having to look in different places to find food, for example,
and coping with a whole new set of dangers.
Then over in Germany at the Max Planck Institute,
there's another biologist called Catarina Miranda
who's done some experiments with blackbirds living in urban and rural areas.
And she's been looking not at their anatomy but at their behaviour.
So as you might expect, she's found that the urban blackbirds tend to be quite bold -
they're prepared to face up to a lot of threats that would frighten away their country counterparts.
But there's one type of situation that does seem to frighten the urban blackbirds,
and that's anything new - anything they haven't experienced before.
And if you think about it, that's quite sensible for a bird living in the city.
Jonathan Atwell, in Indiana University,
is looking at how a range of animals respond to urban environments.
He's found that when they're under stress,
their endocrine systems react by reducing the amount of hormones such as corticosterone into their blood.
It's a sensible-seeming adaptation.
A rat that gets scared every time a subway train rolls past won't be very successful.
There's just one more study I'd like to mention which is by Sarah Partan and her team,
and they've been looking at how squirrels communicate in an urban environment,
and they've found that a routine part of their communication is carried out by waving their tails.
You do also see this in the country, but it's much more prevalent in cities,
possibly because it's effective in a noisy environment.
So what are the long-term implications of this?
One possibility is that we may see completely new species developing in cities.
But on the other hand, it's possible that not all of these adaptations will be permanent.
Once the animal's got accustomed to its new environment,
it may no longer need the features it's developed.
So, now we've had a look‚Ä¶

1090,Cam13 - Test 2 - Part 1,B1,cam13---test-2---part-1,83,"Hello, South City Cycling Club.
Oh, hi.
I want to find out about joining the club.
Right. I can help you there.
I'm the club secretary and my name's Jim Hunter.
Oh, hi Jim.
So, are you interested in membership for yourself?
That's right.
OK. Well there are basically two types of adult membership.
If you're pretty serious about cycling, there's the Full membership.
That costs $260
and that covers you not just for ordinary cycling
but also for races both here in the city and also in other parts of Australia.
Right. Well, I'm not really up to that standard.
I was more interested in just joining a group to do some cycling in my free time.
Sure.
That's why most people join.
So, in that case you'd be better with the Recreational membership.
That's $108 if you're over 19, and $95 if you're under.
I'm 25.
OK.
It's paid quarterly, and you can upgrade it later to the Full membership if you want to, of course.
Now both types of membership include the club fee of $20.
They also provide insurance in case you have an accident, though we hope you won't need that, of course.
No.
OK, well, I'll go with the Recreational membership, I think.
And that allows me to join in the club activities, and so on?
That's right.
And once you're a member of the club, you're also permitted to wear our kit when you're out cycling.
It's green and white.
Yes, I've seen cyclists wearing it.
So, can I buy that at the club?
Ah.. no, it's made to order by a company in Brisbane.
You can find them online: they're called Jerriz.
That's JERRIZ.
You can use your membership number to put in an order on their website.
OK.
Now, can you tell me a bit about the rides I can do?
Sure.
So we have training rides pretty well every morning,
and they're a really good way of improving your cycling skills as well as your general level of fitness,
but they're different levels.
Level A is pretty fast - you're looking at about 30 or 35 kilometres an hour.
If you can do about 25 kilometres an hour, you'd probably be level B,
and then level C are the novices, who stay at about 15 kilometres per hour.
Right.
Well I reckon I'd be level B.
So, when are the sessions for that level?
Ah... there are a couple each week.
They're both early morning sessions.
There's one on Tuesdays, and for that one you meet at 5.30 am,
and the meeting point's the stadium.
Do you know where that is?
Yes, it's quite near my home, in fact.
OK, and how about the other one?
That's on Thursdays.
It starts at the same time, but they meet at the main gate to the park.
Is that the one just past the shopping mall?
That's it.
So how long are the rides?
Ah.. they're about an hour and a half.
So, if you have a job it's easy to fit in before you go to work.
And the members often go somewhere for coffee afterwards, so it's quite a social event.
OK. That sounds good.
I've only just moved to the city so I don't actually know many people yet.
Well, it's a great way to meet people.
And does each ride have a leader?
Sometimes, but not always.
But you don't really need one; the group members on the ride support one another, anyway.
How would we know where to go?
If you check the club website, you'll see that the route for each ride is clearly marked.
So you can just print that out and take it along with you.
It's similar from one week to another, but it's not always exactly the same.
And what do I need to bring?
Well, bring a bottle of water, and your phone.
You shouldn't use it while you're cycling, but have it with you.
Right.
And in winter, it's well before sunrise when we set out,
so you need to make sure your bike's got lights.
That's OK.
Well, thanks Jim. I'd definitely like to join.
So what's the best way of going about it?
Ah.. you can‚Ä¶

OK, so this meeting is for new staff and staff who haven't been involved with our volunteering projects yet.
So basically, the idea is that we allow staff to give up some of their work time
to help on various charity projects to benefit the local community.
We've been doing this for the last five years and it's been very successful.
Participating doesn't necessarily involve a huge time commitment.
The company will pay for eight hours of your time.
That can be used over one or two days all at once,
or spread over several months throughout the year.
There are some staff who enjoy volunteering so much
they also give up their own free time for a couple of hours every week.
It's completely up to you.
Obviously, many people will have family commitments and aren't as available as other members of staff.
Feedback from staff has been overwhelmingly positive.
Because they felt they were doing something really useful,
nearly everyone agreed that volunteering made them feel more motivated at work.
They also liked building relationships with the people in the local community and felt valued by them.
One or two people also said it was a good thing to have on their CVs.
One particularly successful project last year was the Get Working Project.
This was aimed at helping unemployed people in the area get back to work.
Our staff were able to help them improve their telephone skills,
such as writing down messages and speaking with confidence to potential customers,
which they had found quite difficult.
This is something many employers look for in job applicants -
and something we all do without even thinking about, every day at work.
We've got an exciting new project starting this year.
Up until now, we've mainly focused on projects to do with education and training.
And we'll continue with our reading project in schools and our work with local charities.
But we've also agreed to help out on a conservation project in Redfern Park.
So if any of you fancy being outside and getting your hands dirty, this is the project for you.
I also want to mention the annual Digital Inclusion Day, which is coming up next month.
The aim of this is to help older people keep up with technology.
And this year, instead of hosting the event in our own training facility,
we're using the ICT suite at Hill College,
as it can hold far more people.
We've invited over 60 people from the Silver Age Community Centre to take part,
so we'll need a lot of volunteers to help with this event.
If you're interested in taking part,
please go to the volunteering section of our website and complete the relevant form.
We won't be providing any training for this
but you'll be paired with an experienced volunteer if you've never done it before.
By the way, don't forget to tell your manager about any volunteering activities you decide to do.
The participants on the Digital Inclusion Day really benefited.
The majority were in their seventies,
though some were younger and a few were even in their nineties!
Quite a few owned both a computer and a mobile phone,
but these tended to be outdated models.
They generally knew how to do simple things, like send texts,
but weren't aware of recent developments in mobile phone technology.
A few were keen to learn but most were quite dismissive at first -
they couldn't see the point of updating their skills.
But that soon changed.
The feedback was very positive.
The really encouraging thing was that participants all said
they felt much more confident about using social media to keep in touch with their grandchildren,
who prefer this form of communication to phoning or sending emails.
A lot of them also said playing online games would help them make new friends and keep their brains active.
They weren't that impressed with being able to order their groceries online,
as they liked going out to the shops,
but some said it would come in handy if they were ill or the weather was really bad.
One thing they asked about was using tablets for things like reading newspapers -
some people had been given tablets as presents but had never used them,
so that's something we'll make sure we include this time‚Ä¶

Thank you.
Now you wanted to consult me about your class presentation on nanotechnology -
you're due to give it in next week, aren't you?
That's right. And I'm really struggling.
I chose the topic because I didn't know much about it and wanted to learn more,
but now I've read so much about it, in a way there's too much to say -
I could talk for much longer than the twenty minutes I've been allocated.
Should I assume the other students don't know much, and give them a kind of general introduction,
or should I try and make them share my fascination with a particular aspect?
You could do either,
but you'll need to have it clear in your own mind.
Then I think I'll give an overview.
OK.
Now, one way of approaching this is to work through developments in chronological order.
On the other hand, you could talk about the numerous ways that nanotechnology is being applied.
You mean things like thin films on camera displays to make them water-repellent,
and additives to make motorcycle helmets stronger and lighter.
Exactly.
Or another way would be to focus on its impact in one particular area,
say medicine, or space exploration.
That would make it easier to focus.
Perhaps I should do that.
I think that would be a good idea.
Right.
How important is it to include slides in the presentation?
They aren't essential, by any means.
And there's a danger of tailoring what you say to fit whatever slides you can find.
While it can be good to include slides,
you could end up spending too long looking for suitable ones.
You might find it better to leave them out.
I see.
Another thing I was wondering about was how to start.
I know presentations often begin with
'First I'm going to talk about this, and then I'll talk about that',
but I thought about asking the audience what they know about nanotechnology.
That would be fine if you had an hour or two for the presentation,
but you might find that you can't do anything with the answers you get,
and it simply eats into the short time that's available.
So, maybe I should mention a particular way that nanotechnology is used, to focus people's attention.
That sounds sensible.
What do you think I should do next?
I really have to plan the presentation today and tomorrow.
Well, initially I think you should ignore all the notes you've made,
take a small piece of paper, and write a single short sentence that ties together the whole presentation:
it can be something as simple as 'Nanotechnology is already improving our lives'.
Then start planning the content around that.
You can always modify that sentence later, if you need to.
OK.
OK, now let's think about actually giving the presentation.
You've only given one before, if I remember correctly,
about an experiment you'd been involved in.
That's right.
It was pretty rubbish!
Let's say it was better in some respects than in others.
With regard to the structure.
I felt that you ended rather abruptly, without rounding it off.
Be careful not to do that in next week's presentation.
OK.
And you made very little eye contact with the audience,
because you were looking down at your notes most of the time.
You need to be looking at the audience and only occasionally glancing at your notes.
Your body language was a little odd.
Every time you showed a slide, you turned your back on the audience so you could look at it -
you should have been looking at your laptop.
And you kept scratching your head,
so I found myself wondering when you were next going to do that,
instead of listening to what you were saying!
Oh dear.
What did you think of the language?
I knew that not everyone was familiar with the subject,
so I tried to make it as simple as I could.
Yes, that came across.
You used a few words that are specific to the field,
but you always explained what they meant,
so the audience wouldn't have had any difficulty understanding.
I must say the handouts you prepared were well thought out.
They were a good summary of your presentation,
which people would have been able to refer to later on.
So well done on that.
Thank you.
Well, I hope that helps you with next week's presentation.
Yes, it will. Thanks a lot.
I'll look forward to seeing a big improvement, then.

1093,Cam13 - Test 2 - Part 4,C1,cam13---test-2---part-4,67,"Today, we'll be continuing the series of lectures on memory
by focusing on what is called episodic memory
and what can happen if this is not working properly.
Episodic memory refers to the memory of an event or 'episode'.
Episodic memories allow us to mentally travel back in time to an event from the past.
Episodic memories include various details about these events,
for example, when an event happened
and other information such as the location.
To help understand this concept,
try to remember the last time you ate dinner at a restaurant.
The ability to remember where you ate,
who you were with and the items you ordered are all features of an episodic memory.
Episodic memory is distinct from another type of memory called semantic memory.
This is the type of factual memory that we have in common with everyone else -
that is your general knowledge of the world.
To build upon a previous example,
remembering where you parked your car is an example of episodic memory,
but your understanding of what a car is
and how an engine works are examples of semantic memory.
Unlike episodic memory, semantic memory isn't dependent on recalling personal experiences.
Episodic memory can be thought of as a process with several different steps of memory processing:
encoding, consolidation and retrieval.
The initial step is called encoding.
This involves the process of receiving and registering information,
which is necessary for creating memories of information or events that you experience.
The degree to which you can successfully encode information
depends on the level of attention you give to an event while it's actually happening.
Being distracted can make effective encoding very difficult.
Encoding of episodic memories is also influenced by how you process the event.
For example, if you were introduced to someone called Charlie,
you might make the connection that your uncle has the same name.
Future recollection of Charlie's name is much easier
if you have a strategy to help you encode it.
Memory consolidation, the next step in forming an episodic memory,
is the process by which memories of encoded information are strengthened,
stabilised and stored to facilitate later retrieval.
Consolidation is most effective when the information being stored
can be linked to an existing network of information.
Consolidation makes it possible for you to store memories for later retrieval indefinitely.
Forming strong memories depends on the frequency with which you try to retrieve them.
Memories can fade or become harder to retrieve if they aren't used very often.
The last step in forming episodic memories is called retrieval,
which is the conscious recollection of encoded information.
Retrieving information from episodic memory depends upon
semantic, olfactory, auditory and visual factors.
These help episodic memory retrieval by acting as a prompt.
For example, when recalling where you parked your car
you may use the colour of a sign close to where you parked.
You actually have to mentally travel back to the moment you parked.
There are a wide range of neurological diseases
and conditions that can affect episodic memory.
These range from Alzheimer's to schizophrenia to autism.
An impairment of episodic memory can have a profound effect on individuals' lives.
For example, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be reasonably well controlled by medication;
however, patients' episodic memory may still be impaired
and so they are often unable to return to university or work.
Recent studies have shown that computer-assisted games designed to keep the brain active
can help improve their episodic memory.
Episodic memories can help people connect with others,
for instance by sharing intimate details about their past;
something individuals with autism often have problems with.
This may be caused by an absence of a sense of self.
This is essential for the storage of episodic memory,
and has been found to be impaired in children with autism.
Research has shown that treatments that improve memory
may also have a positive impact on children's social development.
One study...

1094,Cam13 - Test 3 - Part 1,B2,cam13---test-3---part-1,78,"Hello, Linda speaking.
Oh hi, Linda.
This is Matt Brooks.
Alex White gave me your number.
He said you'd be able to give me some advice about moving to Banford.
Yes, Alex did mention you.
How can I help?
Well, first of all - which area to live in?
Well, I live in Dalton, which is a really nice suburb -
not too expensive, and there's a nice park.
Sounds good.
Do you know how much it would be to rent a two bedroom flat there?
Yeah, you should be able to get something reasonable for 850 pounds per month.
That's what people typically pay.
You certainly wouldn't want to pay more than 900 pounds.
That doesn't include bills or anything.
No. That sounds alright.
I'll definitely have a look there.
Are the transport links easy from where you live?
Well, I'm very lucky.
I work in the city centre so I don't have to use public transport.
I go by bike.
Oh, I wish I could do that.
Is it safe to cycle around the city?
Yes, it's fine.
And it keeps me fit.
Anyway, driving to work in the city centre would be a nightmare
because there's hardly any parking.
And the traffic during the rush hour can be bad.
I'd be working from home
but I'd have to go to London one or two days a week.
Oh, that's perfect.
Getting to London is no problem.
There's a fast train every 30 minutes which only takes 45 minutes.
That's good.
Yeah, the train service isn't bad during the week.
And they run quite late at night.
It's weekends that are a problem.
They're always doing engineering work
and you have to take a bus to Hadham
and pick up the train there, which is really slow.
But other than that, Banford's a great place to live.
I've never been happier.
There are some nice restaurants in the city centre
and a brand new cinema which has only been open a couple of months.
There's a good arts centre too.
Sounds like Banford's got it all.
Yes! We're really lucky.
There are lots of really good aspects to living here.
The schools are good
and the hospital here is one of the best in the country.
Everyone I know who's been there's had a positive experience.
Oh, I can give you the name of my dentist too in Bridge Street,
if you're interested.
I've been going to him for years and I've never had any problems.
Oh, OK. Thanks!
I'll find his number and send it to you.
Thanks, that would be really helpful.
Are you planning to visit Banford soon?
Yes.
My wife and I are both coming next week.
We want to make some appointments with estate agents.
I could meet you if you like and show you around.
Are you sure?
We'd really appreciate that.
Either a Tuesday or Thursday is good for me, after 5.30.
Thursday's preferable.
Tuesday I need to get home before 6 pm.
Okay great.
Let me know which train you're catching
and I'll meet you in the cafe outside.
You can't miss it.
It's opposite the station and next to the museum.
Brilliant.
I'll text you next week then.
Thanks so much for all the advice.
No problem.
I'll see you next week.

1095,Cam13 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam13---test-3---part-2,52,"So if you are one of those people who hasn't found the perfect physical activity yet,
here are some things to think about which might help you make the right decision for you.
The first question to ask yourself is whether you would enjoy training in a gym.
Many people are put off by the idea of having to fit a visit to the gym into their busy day.
You often have to go very early or late as some gyms can get very crowded
but with regular training you'll see a big difference in a relatively short space of time.
Running has become incredibly popular in recent years.
That's probably got a lot to do with the fact that it's a very accessible form of exercise
that anyone can run even if you could only run a few meters to begin with.
But make sure you get the right shoes.
It's worth investing in a high quality pair and they don't come cheap.
Another great thing about running is that you can do it at any time of day or night.
The only thing that may stop you is snow and ice.
Swimming is another really good way to build fitness.
What attracts many people is that you can swim in an indoor pool at any time of year.
On the other hand, it can be quite boring or solitary.
It's hard to chat to people while you're swimming lengths.
Cycling has become almost as popular as running in recent years.
That's probably because as well as improving their fitness
many people say being out in the fresh air in a park or in the countryside can be fun,
provided the conditions are right of course.
Only fanatics go out in the wind and rain.
Yoga is a good choice for those of you looking for exercise,
which focuses on developing both a healthy mind and body.
It's a good way of building strength
and with the right instructor there's less chance of hurting yourself than with other more active sports.
But don't expect to find it easy.
It can be surprisingly challenging, especially for people who aren't very flexible.
Getting a personal trainer is a good way to start your fitness program.
Obviously there can be significant costs involved.
But if you've got someone there to encourage you and help you achieve your goals,
you're less likely to give up.
Make sure you get someone with a recognised qualification though.
Or you could do yourself permanent damage.
Whatever you do, don't join a gym unless you're sure you'll make good use of it.
So many people waste lots of money by signing up for membership and then hardly ever go.
What happens to their good intentions?
I don't think people suddenly stop caring about improving their fitness
or decide they have more important things to do.
I think people lose interest when they don't think they're making enough progress.
That's when they give up hope and stop believing they'll ever achieve their goals.
Also, what people sometimes don't realize when they start
is that it takes a lot of determination and hard work to keep training week after week,
and lots of people don't have that kind of commitment.
One thing you can do to help yourself is to set manageable goals,
be realistic and don't push yourself too far.
Some people advise writing goals down
but I think it's better to have a flexible approach.
Give yourself a really nice treat every time you reach one of your goals
and don't get too upset if you experience setbacks.
It's a journey.
There are bound to be difficulties along the way.

1096,Cam13 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam13---test-3---part-3,87,"OK, Jim.
You wanted to see me about your textile design project.
That's right.
I've been looking at how a range of natural dyes can be used to colour fabrics like cotton and wool.
Why did you choose that topic?
Well, I got a lot of useful ideas from the museum,
you know, at that exhibition of textiles.
But I've always been interested in anything to do with colour.
Years ago, I went to a carpet shop with my parents when we were on holiday in Turkey,
and I remember all the amazing colours.
They might not all have been natural dyes.
Maybe not, but for the project I decided to follow it up.
And I found a great book about a botanic garden in California that specialises in plants used for dyes.
OK.
So, in your project, you had to include a practical investigation.
Yeah.
At first I couldn't decide on my variables.
I was going to just look at one type of fibre for example, like cotton‚Ä¶
and see how different types of dyes affected it?
Yes.
Then I decided to include others as well,
so I looked at cotton and wool and nylon.
With just one type of dye?
Various types, including some that weren't natural, for comparison.
OK.
So, I did the experiments last week.
I used some ready-made natural dyes.
I found a website which supplied them,
they came in just a few days, but I also made some of my own.
That must have taken quite a bit of time.
Yes,
I'd thought it'd just be a matter of a teaspoon or so of dye,
and actually that wasn't the case at all.
Like I was using one vegetable, beetroot, for a red dye,
and I had to chop up a whole pile of it.
So it all took longer than I'd expected.
One possibility is to use food colourings.
I did use one.
That was a yellow dye, an artificial one.
Tartrazine?
Yeah. I used it on cotton first.
It came out a great colour,
but when I rinsed the material, the colour just washed away.
I'd been going to try it out on nylon, but I abandoned that idea.
Were you worried about health issues?
I'd thought if it's a legal food colouring, it must be safe.
Well, it can occasionally cause allergic reactions, I believe.
So what natural dyes did you look at?
Well, one was turmeric.
The colour's great, it's a really strong yellow.
It's generally used in dishes like curry.
It's meant to be quite good for your health when eaten,
but you might find it's not permanent when it's used as a dye -
a few washes, and it's gone.
Right.
I used beetroot as a dye for wool.
When I chop up beetroot to eat I always end up with bright red hands,
but the wool ended up just a sort of watery cream shade. Disappointing.
There's a natural dye called Tyrian purple. Have you heard of that?
Yes. It comes from a shellfish,
and it was worn in ancient times but only by important people as it was so rare.
I didn't use it.
It fell out of use centuries ago,
though one researcher managed to get hold of some recently.
But that shade of purple can be produced by chemical dyes nowadays.
Did you use any black dyes?
Logwood.
That was quite complicated.
I had to prepare the fabric so the dye would take.
I hope you were careful to wear gloves.
Yes. I know the danger with that dye.
Good. It can be extremely dangerous if it's ingested.
Now, presumably you had a look at an insect-based dye? Like cochineal, for example?
Yes. I didn't actually make that,
I didn't have time to start crushing up insects to get the red colour
and anyway they're not available here,
but I managed to get the dye quite easily from a website.
But it cost a fortune.
I can see why it's generally just used in cooking, and in small quantities.
Yes, it's very effective, but that's precisely why it's not used as a dye.
I also read about using metal oxide.
Apparently you can allow iron to rust while it's in contact with the fabric, and that colours it.
Yes, that works well for dying cotton.
But you have to be careful as the metal can actually affect the fabric
and so you can't expect to get a lot of wear out of fabrics treated in this way.
And the colours are quite subtle, not everyone likes them.
Anyway, it looks as if you've done a lot of work‚Ä¶

1097,Cam13 - Test 3 - Part 4,B2,cam13---test-3---part-4,59,"Last week, we started looking at reptiles, including crocodiles and snakes.
Today, I'd like us to have a look at another reptile - the lizard -
and in particular, at some studies that have been done on a particular type of lizard
whose Latin name is tiliqua rugosa.
This is commonly known as the sleepy lizard,
because it's quite slow in its movements and spends quite a lot of its time dozing under rocks or lying in the sun.
I'll start with a general description.
Sleepy lizards live in Western and South Australia, where they're quite common.
Unlike European lizards, which are mostly small, green and fast-moving,
sleepy lizards are brown,
but what's particularly distinctive about them is the colour of their tongue, which is dark blue,
in contrast with the lining of their mouth which is bright pink.
And they're much bigger than most European lizards.
They have quite a varied diet, including insects and even small animals,
but they mostly eat plants of varying kinds.
Even though they're quite large and powerful,
with strong jaws that can crush beetles and snail shells,
they still have quite a few predators.
Large birds like cassowaries were one of the main ones in the past,
but nowadays they're more likely to be caught and killed by snakes.
Actually, another threat to their survival isn't a predator at all, but is man-made -
quite a large number of sleepy lizards are killed by cars when they're trying to cross highways.
One study carried out by Michael Freake at Flinders University
investigated the methods of navigation of these lizards.
Though they move slowly, they can travel quite long distances.
And he found that even if they were taken some distance away from their home territory,
they could usually find their way back home as long as they could see the sky -
they didn't need any other landmarks on the ground.
Observations of these lizards in the wild have also revealed that their mating habits are quite unusual.
Unlike most animals, it seems that they're relatively monogamous,
returning to the same partner year after year.
And the male and female also stay together for a long time,
both before and after the birth of their young.
It's quite interesting to think about the possible reasons for this.
It could be that it's to do with protecting their young -
you'd expect them to have a much better chance of survival if they have both parents around.
But in fact observers have noted that once the babies have hatched out of their eggs,
they have hardly any contact with their parents.
So, there's not really any evidence to support that idea.
Another suggestion's based on the observation that male lizards in monogamous relationships
tend to be bigger and stronger than other males.
So maybe the male lizards stay around so they can give the female lizards protection from other males.
But again, we're not really sure.
Finally, I'd like to mention another study that involved collecting data by tracking the lizards.
I was actually involved in this myself.
So we caught some lizards in the wild
and we developed a tiny GPS system that would allow us to track them,
and we fixed this onto their tails.
Then we set the lizards free again,
and we were able to track them for twelve days and gather data,
not just about their location, but even about how many steps they took during this period.
One surprising thing we discovered from this
is that there were far fewer meetings between lizards than we expected -
it seems that they were actually trying to avoid one another.
So why would that be?
Well, again we have no clear evidence,
but one hypothesis is that male lizards can cause quite serious injuries to one another,
so maybe this avoidance is a way of preventing this - of self-preservation, if you like.
But we need to collect a lot more data before we can be sure of any of this.

1098,Cam13 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam13---test-4---part-1,75,"Hi Alex. It's Martha Clines here.
James White gave me your number.
I hope you don't mind me calling you.
Of course not. How are you, Martha?
Good thanks.
I'm ringing because I need a bit of advice.
Oh yeah. What about?
The training you did at JPNW a few years ago.
I'm applying for the same thing.
Oh right. Yes, I did mine in 2014.
Best thing I ever did. I'm still working there.
Really? What are you doing?
Well, now I work in the customer services department
but I did my initial training in Finance.
I stayed there for the first two years and then moved to where I am now.
That's the same department I'm applying for.
Did you enjoy it?
Ah... I was pretty nervous to begin with.
I didn't do well in my exams at school
and I was really worried because I failed Maths.
But it didn't actually matter because I did lots of courses on the job.
Did you get a diploma at the end of your trainee period?
I'm hoping to do the one in business skills.
Yes. That sounds good.
I took the one on IT skills but I wish I'd done that one instead.
OK, that's good to know.
What about the other trainees?
How did you get on with them?
There were about 20 of us who started at the same time
and we were all around the same age.
I was 18 and there was only one person younger than me, who was 17.
The rest were between 18 and 20.
I made some good friends.
I've heard lots of good things about the training at JPNW.
It seems like there are a lot of opportunities there.
Yeah, definitely.
Because of its size you can work in loads of different areas within the organisation.
What about pay?
I know you get a lower minimum wage than regular employees.
That's right - which isn't great.
But you get the same number of days' holiday as everyone else.
And the pay goes up massively if they offer you a job at the end of the training period.
Yeah, but I'm not doing it for the money.
It's the experience I think will be really useful.
Everyone says by the end of the year you gain so much confidence.
You're right. That's the most useful part about it.
There's a lot of variety too.
You're given lots of different things to do.
I enjoyed it all - I didn't even mind the studying.
Do you have to spend any time in college?
Yes, one day each month.
So you get lots of support from both your tutor and your manager.
That's good.
And the company is easy to get to, isn't it?
Yes, it's very close to the train station so the location's a real advantage.
Have you got a date for your interview yet?
Yes, it's on the 23rd of this month.
So long as you're well prepared there's nothing to worry about.
Everyone's very friendly.
I am not sure what I should wear.
What do you think?
Nothing too casual - like jeans, for example.
If you've got a nice jacket, wear that with a skirt or trousers.
OK. Thanks.
Any other tips?
Erm, well I know it's really obvious but arrive in plenty of time.
They hate people who are late.
So make sure you know exactly where you have to get to.
And one other useful piece of advice my manager told me before I had the interview for this job - is to smile.
Even if you feel terrified.
It makes people respond better to you.
I'll have to practise doing that in the mirror!
Yeah - well, good luck.
Let me know if you need any more information.
Thanks very much.

1099,Cam13 - Test 4 - Part 2,B1,cam13---test-4---part-2,63,"Hi everyone, welcome to the Snow Centre.
My name's Annie.
I hope you enjoyed the bus trip from the airport -
we've certainly got plenty of snow today!
Well, you've come to New Zealand's premier snow and ski centre,
and we've a whole load of activities for you during your week here.
Most visitors come here for the cross-country skiing,
where you're on fairly flat ground for most of the time,
rather than going down steep mountainsides.
There are marked trails,
but you can also leave these and go off on your own
and that's an experience not to be missed.
You can go at your own speed -
it's great aerobic exercise if you really push yourself,
or if you prefer you can just glide gently along and enjoy the beautiful scenery.
This afternoon, you'll be going on a dog-sled trip.
You may have seen our dogs on TV recently racing in the winter sled festival.
If you want, you can have your own team for the afternoon
and learn how to drive them, following behind our leader on the trail.
Or if you'd prefer, you can just sit back in the sled and enjoy the ride as a passenger.
At the weekend, we have the team relay event,
and you're all welcome to join in.
We have a local school coming along,
and a lot of the teachers are taking part too.
Participation rather than winning is the main focus,
and there's a medal for everyone who takes part.
Participants are in teams of two to four,
and each team must complete four laps of the course.
For your final expedition, you'll head off to Mount Frenner wearing a pair of special snow shoes which allow you to walk on top of the snow.
This is an area where miners once searched for gold,
though there are very few traces of their work left now.
When the snow melts in summer, the mountain slopes are carpeted in flowers and plants.
It's a long ascent, though not too steep,
and walkers generally take a couple of days to get to the summit and return.
You'll spend the night in our hut half-way up the mountain.
That's included in your package for the stay.
It's got cooking facilities, firewood and water for drinking.
For washing, we recommend you use melted snow, though, to conserve supplies.
We can take your luggage up on our snowmobile for you for just $10 a person.
The hut has cooking facilities so you can make a hot meal in the evening and morning,
but you need to take your own food.
The weather on Mount Frenner can be very stormy.
In that case, stay in the hut - generally the storms don't last long.
Don't stress about getting back here to the centre in time to catch the airport bus -
they'll probably not be running anyway.
We do have an emergency locator beacon in the hut
but only use that if it's a real emergency, like if someone's ill or injured.
Now, let me tell you something about the different ski trails you can follow during your stay here.
Highland Trail's directly accessible from where we are now.
This trail's been designed to give first-timers an experience they'll enjoy regardless of their age or skill,
but it's also ideal for experts to practise their technique.
Then there's Pine Trail‚Ä¶
if you're nervous about skiing, leave this one to the experts!
You follow a steep valley looking right down on the river below - scary!
But if you've fully mastered the techniques needed for hills, it's great fun.
Stony Trail's a good choice once you've got a general idea of the basics.
There are one or two tricky sections, but nothing too challenging.
There's a shelter half-way where you can sit and take a break and enjoy the afternoon sunshine.
And finally, Loser's Trail.
This starts off following a gentle river valley
but the last part is quite exposed so the snow conditions can be challenging -
if it's snowing or windy, check with us before you set out to make sure the trail's open that day.
Right, so now if you'd like to follow me, we'll get started‚Ä¶

1100,Cam13 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam13---test-4---part-3,79,"I've still got loads to do for our report on nutritional food labels.
Me too.
What did you learn from doing the project about your own shopping habits?
Well, I've always had to check labels for traces of peanuts in everything I eat because of my allergy.
But beyond that I've never really been concerned enough to check how healthy a product is.
This project has actually taught me to read the labels much more carefully.
I tended to believe claims on packaging like 'low in fat'.
But I now realise that the 'healthy' yoghurt I've bought for years is full of sugar
and that it's actually quite high in calories.
Ready meals are the worst‚Ä¶
comparing the labels on supermarket pizzas was a real eye-opener.
Did you have any idea how many calories they contain?
I was amazed.
Yes, because unless you read the label really carefully,
you wouldn't know that the nutritional values given are for half a pizza.
When most people eat the whole pizza.
Not exactly transparent is it?
Not at all.
But I expect it won't stop you from buying pizza?
Probably not, no!
I thought comparing the different labelling systems used by food manufactures was interesting.
I think the kind of labelling system used makes a big difference.
Which one did you prefer?
I liked the traditional daily value system best -
the one which tells you what proportion of your required daily intake of each ingredient the product contains.
I'm not sure it's the easiest for people to use but at least you get the full story.
I like to know all the ingredients in a product -
not just how much fat, salt and sugar they contain.
But it's good supermarkets have been making an effort to provide reliable information for customers.
Yes. There just needs to be more consistency between labelling systems used by different supermarkets,
in terms of portion sizes, etc.
The labels on the different brands of chicken flavour crisps were quite revealing too, weren't they?
Yeah.
I don't understand how they can get away with calling them chicken flavour
when they only contain artificial additives.
I know.
I'd at least have expected them to contain a small percentage of real chicken.
Absolutely.
I think having nutritional food labeling has been a good idea, don't you?
I think it will change people's behaviour and stop mothers, in particular, buying the wrong things.
But didn't that study kind of prove the opposite?
People didn't necessarily stop buying unhealthy products.
They only said that might be the case.
Those findings weren't that conclusive and it was quite a small-scale study.
I think more research has to be done.
Yes, I think you're probably right.
What do you think of the traffic-light system?
I think supermarkets like the idea of having a colour-coded system -
red, orange or green - for levels of fat, sugar and salt in a product.
But it's not been adopted universally.
And not on all products.
Why do you suppose that is?
Pressure from the food manufacturers.
Hardly surprising that some of them are opposed to flagging up how unhealthy their products are.
I'd have thought it would have been compulsory.
It seems ridiculous it isn't.
I know.
And what I couldn't get over is the fact that it was brought in without enough consultation -
a lot of experts had deep reservations about it.
That is a bit weird.
I suppose there's an argument for doing the research now when consumers are familiar with this system.
Yeah, maybe.
The participants in the survey were quite positive about the traffic-light system.
But I don't think they targeted the right people.
They should have focused on people with low literacy levels
because these labels are designed to be accessible to them.
Yeah.
But it's good to get feedback from all socio-economic groups.
And there wasn't much variation in their responses.
No.
But if they hadn't interviewed participants face-to-face,
they could have used a much bigger sample size.
I wonder why they chose that method?
Dunno.
How were they selected?
Did they volunteer or were they approached?
I think they volunteered.
The thing that wasn't stated was how often they bought packaged food -
all we know is how frequently they used the supermarket.

1101,Cam13 - Test 4 - Part 4,C1,cam13---test-4---part-4,72,"In my presentation, I'm going to talk about coffee,
and its importance both in economic and social terms.
We think it was first drunk in the Arab world,
but there's hardly any documentary evidence of it before the 1500s,
although of course that doesn't mean that people didn't know about it before then.
However, there is evidence that coffee was originally gathered from bushes
growing wild in Ethiopia, in the northeast of Africa.
In the early 16th century,
it was being bought by traders,
and gradually its use as a drink spread throughout the Middle East.
It's also known that in 1522,
in the Turkish city of Constantinople, which was the centre of the Ottoman Empire,
the court physician approved its use as a medicine.
By the mid-1500s, coffee bushes were being cultivated in the Yemen
and for the next hundred years this region produced most of the coffee drunk in Africa and the Arab world.
What's particularly interesting about coffee is its effect on social life.
It was rarely drunk at home,
but instead people went to coffee houses to drink it.
These people, usually men, would meet to drink coffee and chat about issues of the day.
But at the time, this chance to share ideas and opinions was seen as something that was potentially dangerous,
and in 1623 the ruler of Constantinople demanded the destruction of all the coffee houses in the city,
although after his death many new ones opened, and coffee consumption continued.
In the seventeenth century, coffee drinking spread to Europe,
and here too coffee shops became places where ordinary people, nearly always men, could meet to exchange ideas.
Because of this, some people said that these places performed a similar function to universities.
The opportunity they provided for people to meet together outside their own homes
and to discuss the topics of the day had an enormous impact on social life,
and many social movements and political developments had their origins in coffee house discussions.
In the late 1600s, the Yemeni monopoly on coffee production broke down
and coffee production started to spread around the world, helped by European colonization.
Europeans set up coffee plantations in Indonesia and the Caribbean
and production of coffee in the colonies skyrocketed.
Different types of coffee were produced in different areas,
and it's interesting that the names given to these different types,
like Mocha or Java coffee,
were often taken from the port they were shipped to Europe from.
But if you look at the labour system in the different colonies,
there were some significant differences.
In Brazil and the various Caribbean colonies,
coffee was grown in huge plantations
and the workers there were almost all slaves.
But this wasn't the same in all colonies;
for example in Java, which had been colonized by the Dutch,
the peasants grew coffee and passed a proportion of this on to the Dutch,
so it was used as a means of taxation.
But whatever system was used, under the European powers of the 18th century,
coffee production was very closely linked to colonisation.
Coffee was grown in ever-increasing quantities to satisfy the growing demand from Europe,
and it became nearly as important as sugar production,
which was grown under very similar conditions.
However, coffee prices were not yet low enough for people to drink it regularly at home,
so most coffee consumption still took place in public coffee houses
and it still remained something of a luxury item.
In Britain, however, a new drink was introduced from China,
and started to become popular, gradually taking over from coffee,
although at first it was so expensive that only the upper classes could afford it.
This was tea,
and by the late 1700s it was being widely drunk.
However, when the USA gained independence from Britain in 1776,
they identified this drink with Britain,
and coffee remained the preferred drink in the USA, as it still is today.
So, by the early 19th century, coffee was already being widely produced and consumed.
But during this century, production boomed and coffee prices started to fall.
This was partly because new types of transportation had been developed which were cheaper and more efficient.
So now, working people could afford to buy coffee -
it wasn't just a drink for the middle classes.
And this was at a time when large parts of Europe were starting to work in industries.
And sometimes this meant their work didn't stop when it got dark;
they might have to continue throughout the night.
So, the use of coffee as a stimulant became important -
it wasn't just a drink people drank in the morning, for breakfast.
There were also changes in cultivation‚Ä¶

1102,Cam12 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam12---test-1---part-1,82,"Hi. Can I help you?
I'd like to find out if you have any excursions suitable for families.
Sure.
How about taking your family for a cruise?
We have a steamship that takes passengers out several times a day -
it's over 100 years old.
That sounds interesting.
How long is the trip?
About an hour and a half.
And don't forget to take pictures of the mountains.
They're all around you when you're on the boat and they look fantastic.
OK.
And I assume there's a caf√© or something on board?
Sure. How old are your children?
Er, my daughter's fifteen and my son's seven.
Right.
Well, there are various things you can do once you've crossed the lake, to make a day of it.
One thing that's very popular is a visit to the Country Farm.
You're met off the boat by the farmer and he'll take you to the holding pens, where the sheep are kept.
Children love feeding them!
My son would love that.
He really likes animals.
Well, there's also a 40-minute trek round the farm on a horse, if he wants.
Do you think he'd manage it?
He hasn't done that before.
Sure. It's suitable for complete beginners.
Good.
And again, visitors are welcome to explore the farm on their own,
as long as they take care to close gates and so on.
There are some very beautiful gardens along the side of the lake which also belong to the farm -
they'll be just at their best now.
You could easily spend an hour or two there.
OK. Well that all sounds good.
And can we get lunch there?
You can, and it's very good, though it's not included in the basic cost.
You pay when you get there.
Right.
So is there anything else to do over on that side of the lake?
Well, what you can do is take a bike over on the ship and then go on a cycling trip.
There's a trail there called the Back Road -
you could easily spend three or four hours exploring it,
and the scenery's wonderful.
They'll give you a map when you get your ticket for the cruise -
there's no extra charge.
What's the trail like in terms of difficulty?
Quite challenging in places.
It wouldn't be suitable for your seven-year-old.
It needs someone who's got a bit more experience.
Well, my daughter loves cycling and so do I, so maybe the two of us could go,
and my wife and son could stay on the farm.
That might work out quite well.
But we don't have bikes here‚Ä¶
is there somewhere we could rent them?
Yes, there's a place here in the city.
It's called Ratchesons.
I'll just make a note of that...
er, how do you spell it?
RATCHESONS.
It's just by the cruise ship terminal.
OK.
You'd also need to pick up a repair kit for the bike from there to take along with you,
and you'd need to take along a snack and some water -
it'd be best to get those in the city.
Fine.
That shouldn't be a problem.
And I assume I can rent a helmet from the bike place?
Sure, you should definitely get that.
It's a great ride, but you want to be well prepared because it's very remote -
you won't see any shops round there, or anywhere to stay,
so you need to get back in time for the last boat.
Yeah. So what sort of prices are we looking at here?
Let's see, that'd be one adult and one child for the cruise with farm tour,
that's $117
and an adult and a child for the cruise only so that's $214 altogether.
Oh, wait a minute,
how old did you say your daughter was?
Fifteen.
Then I'm afraid it's $267
because she has to pay the adult fare, which is $75
instead of the child fare which is $22.
Sorry about that.
That's OK.

1103,Cam12 - Test 1 - Part 2,B1,cam12---test-1---part-2,61,"Good morning everyone.
My name's Joy Parkins and I'm the restaurant manager.
And I understand that none of you've had any previous experience as kitchen assistants?
Well, you might be feeling a bit nervous now,
but most of our kitchen assistants say they enjoy the work.
OK, they might get shouted at sometimes, but it's nothing personal,
and they're pleased that they have so many different things to do, which means they never get bored.
And I'll tell you straightaway that if you do well,
we might think about moving you up and giving you some more responsibility.
Right, well, you've all shown up on time, which is an excellent start.
Now I'm glad to see none of you have unsuitable footwear, so that's good -
you need to be careful as the floors can get very wet and slippery.
Those of you with long hair have got it well out of the way,
but some of you'll need to remove your rings and bracelets - just put them somewhere safe for today,
and remember to leave them at home tomorrow, as they can be a safety hazard.
Now it's going to be a busy day for you all today -
we don't have any tables free for this evening,
and only a few for lunch.
Fortunately we've got our Head Chef back -
he was away on holiday all last week which meant the other chefs had extra work.
Now, I'll tell you a bit more about the job in a minute
but first, some general regulations.
For all of you, whatever your age,
there's some equipment you mustn't use until you've been properly trained,
like the waste disposal system for example,
for health and safety reasons.
Then I think there are two of you here who are under 18 -
that's Emma and Jake, isn't it?
Right, so for you two, the meat slicer is out of bounds.
And of course none of you are allowed to use the electric mixer
until you've been shown how it works.
Now you may have heard that this can be a stressful job,
and I have to say that can be true.
You'll be working an eight-hour day for the first week,
though you'll have the chance to do overtime after that as well if you want to.
But however long the hours are, you'll get a break in the middle.
What you will find is that you're on your feet all day long, lifting and carrying,
so if you're not fit now you soon will be!
You'll find you don't have much chance to take it easy -
when someone tells you to do something you need to do it straightaway -
but at least we do have a very efficient air conditioning system compared with some kitchens.
Now let me tell you about some of the people you need to know.
So as I said, I'm Joy Parkins
and I decide who does what during the day and how long they work for.
I'll be trying to get you to work with as many different people in the kitchen as possible,
so that you learn while you're on the job.
One person whose name you must remember is David Field.
If you injure yourself at all, even if it's really minor,
you must report to him and he'll make sure the incident is recorded
and you get the appropriate treatment.
He's trained to give basic treatment to staff himself,
or he'll send you off somewhere else if necessary.
Then there's Dexter Wills -
he's the person you need to see if you smash a plate or something like that.
Don't just leave it and hope no one will notice -
it's really important to get things noted and replaced or there could be problems later.
And finally, there's Mike Smith.
He's the member of staff who takes care of all the stores of perishables,
so if you notice we're getting low in flour or sugar or something,
make sure you let him know so he can put in an order.
OK, now the next thing‚Ä¶

1104,Cam12 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam12---test-1---part-3,76,"OK, Stewart. We need to start planning our paper on public libraries.
Have you thought of an angle yet?
Well, there's so much we could look into.
How libraries have changed over the centuries, for instance, or...
how different countries organise them.
What do you think, Trudie?
Maybe we should concentrate on this country, and try and relate the changes in libraries to external developments,
like the fact that far more people can read than a century ago,
and that the local population may speak lots of different languages.
We could include something about changes in the source of funding, too.
Yes, but remember we're only supposed to write a short paper,
so it's probably best if we don't go into funding in any detail.
Right.
Well, shall we just brainstorm a few ideas, to get started?
OK.
We obviously need to look at the impact of new technology, particularly the internet.
Now that lots of books have been digitalised, people can access them from their own computers at home.
And if everyone did that, libraries would be obsolete.
Yes.
But the digitalised books that are available online for free are mostly out of copyright, aren't they?
And copyright in this country lasts for 70 years after the author dies.
So you won't find the latest best-seller or up-to-date information.
That's an important point.
Anyway, I find it hard to concentrate when I'm reading a long text on a screen.
I'd much rather read a physical book.
And it takes longer to read on a screen.
Oh, I prefer it.
I suppose it's just a personal preference.
I expect that libraries will go on evolving in the next few years.
Some have already become centres where community activities take place,
like local clubs meeting there.
I think that'll become even more common.
I'd like to think so,
and that they'll still be serving their traditional function, but I'm not so sure.
There are financial implications, after all.
What I'm afraid will happen is that books and magazines will all disappear, and there'll just be rows and rows of computers.
They won't look anything like the libraries we're used to.
Well, we'll see.
I've just had an idea.
Why don't we make an in-depth study of our local public library as background to our paper?
Yes, that'd be interesting, and raise all sorts of issues.
Let's make a list of possible things we could ask about,
then work out some sort of structure.
For instance, um, we could interview some of the staff,
and find out whether the library has its own budget, or if that's controlled by the local council.
And what their policies are.
I know they don't allow food,
but I'd love to find out what types of noise they ban -
there always seems to be a lot of talking, but never music.
I don't know if that's a policy or it just happens.
Ah, I've often wondered.
Then there are things like how the library is affected by employment laws.
I suppose there are rules about working hours, facilities for staff, and so on.
Right.
Then there are other issues relating to the design of the building and how customers use it.
Like what measures does the library take to ensure their safety?
They'd need floor coverings that aren't slippery, and emergency exits, for instance.
Oh, and another thing -
there's the question of the kind of insurance the library needs to have, in case anyone gets injured.
Yes, that's something else to find out.
You know something I've often wondered?
What's that?
Well, you know they've got an archive of local newspapers going back years?
Well, next to it they've got the diary of a well-known politician from the late 19th century.
I wonder why it's there.
Do you know what his connection was with this area?
No idea.
Let's add it to our list of things to find out.
Oh, I've just thought -
you know people might ask in the library about local organisations, like sports clubs?
Well, I wonder if they keep a database, or whether they just look online.
Right.
I quite fancy finding out what the differences are between a library that's open to the public
and one that's part of a museum, for example -
they must be very different.
Then something else I'd like to know is‚Ä¶
",https://dailydictation.com/upload/ielts-listening/ielts-cambridge-12-test-1-part-3-2023-04-18-00-18-35/0-ielts-cambridge-12-test-1-part-3.mp3,4,58
1105,Cam12 - Test 1 - Part 4,C1,cam12---test-1---part-4,86,"In public discussion of business, we take certain values for granted.
Today I'm going to talk about four of them:
collaboration, hard work, creativity and excellence.
Most people would say they're all 'good things'.
I'm going to suggest that's an over-simple view.
The trouble with these values is that they're theoretical concepts,
removed from the reality of day-to-day business.
Pursue values by all means,
but be prepared for what may happen as a result.
They can actually cause damage, which is not at all the intention.
Business leaders generally try to do the right thing.
But all too often the right thing backfires,
if those leaders adopt values without understanding and managing the side effects that arise.
The values can easily get in the way of what's actually intended.
OK. So the first value I'm going to discuss is collaboration.
Er, let me give you an example.
On a management training course I once attended,
we were put into groups and had to construct a bridge across a stream,
using building blocks that we were given.
The rule was that everyone in the team had to move at least one building block during the construction.
This was intended to encourage teamwork.
But it was really a job best done by one person.
The other teams tried to collaborate on building the structure,
and descended into confusion, with everyone getting in each other's way.
Our team leader solved the challenge brilliantly.
She simply asked everyone in the team to move a piece a few centimetres, to comply with the rule,
and then let the person in the team with an aptitude for puzzles like this build it alone.
We finished before any other team.
My point is that the task wasn't really suited to teamworking,
so why make it one?
Teamwork can also lead to inconsistency - a common cause of poor sales.
In the case of a smartphone that a certain company launched,
one director wanted to target the business market,
and another demanded it was aimed at consumers.
The company wanted both directors to be involved,
so gave the product a consumer-friendly name,
but marketed it to companies.
The result was that it met the needs of neither group.
It would have been better to let one director or the other have his way,
not both.
Now industriousness, or hard work.
It's easy to mock people who say they work hard:
after all, a hamster running around in a wheel is working hard - and getting nowhere.
Of course hard work is valuable, but only when properly targeted.
Otherwise it wastes the resources that companies value most: time and energy.
And that's bad for the organisation.
There's a management model that groups people according to four criteria:
clever, hard-working, stupid and lazy.
Here 'lazy' means having a rational determination not to carry out unnecessary tasks.
It doesn't mean trying to avoid work altogether.
Most people display two of these characteristics,
and the most valuable people are those who are both clever and lazy:
they possess intellectual clarity, and they don't rush into making decisions.
They come up with solutions to save the time and energy spent by the stupid and hard-working group.
Instead of throwing more man-hours at a problem,
the clever and lazy group looks for a more effective solution.
Next we come to creativity.
This often works well - creating an attention-grabbing TV commercial, for example,
might lead to increased sales.
But it isn't always a good thing.
Some advertising campaigns are remembered for their creativity,
without having any effect on sales.
This happened a few years ago with the launch of a chocolate bar:
subsequent research showed that plenty of consumers remembered the adverts,
but had no idea what was being advertised.
The trouble is that the creator derives pleasure from coming up with the idea,
and wrongly assumes the audience for the campaign will share that feeling.
A company that brings out thousands of new products may seem more creative than a company that only has a few,
but it may be too creative, and make smaller profits.
Creativity needs to be targeted, to solve a problem that the company has identified.
Just coming up with more and more novel products isn't necessarily a good thing.
And finally, excellence.
We all know companies that claim they 'strive for excellence',
but it takes a long time to achieve excellence.
In business, being first with a product is more profitable than having the best product.
A major study of company performance compared pioneers -
that is, companies bringing out the first version of a particular product -
with followers, the companies that copied and improved on that product.
The study found that the pioneers commanded an average market share of 29%,
while the followers achieved less than half that, only 13% -
even though their product might have been better.
Insisting on excellence in everything we do is time-consuming, wastes energy
and leads to losing out on opportunities.
Sometimes, second-rate work is more worthwhile than excellence.
'Make sure it's excellent' sounds like a good approach to business,
but the 'just-get-started' approach is likely to be more successful.

and the events will start at 2.45, and finish about 5.30.
OK, thanks. I'll make sure I get there early to get a good spot.
The festival will be officially opened by the mayor.
He'll just speak for a few minutes, welcoming everyone to the festival.
All the town councillors will be there, and of course lots of other people.
Right.
Then there'll be a performance by a band.
Most years we have a children's choir,
but this year the local army cadets offered to perform,
and they're very good.
After that, a community group from the town will perform a play they've written themselves, just a short one.
It's about Helen Tungate.
I don't know if you've heard of her?
I certainly have.
She was a scientist years ago.
That's right.
She was born in Kenton exactly 100 years ago,
so we're celebrating her centenary.
I'm a biologist, so I've always been interested in her,
I didn't realise she came from Kenton.
Yes.
Well, all that will take place in the afternoon,
and later, as the sun sets, there'll be a firework display.
You should go to the park to watch, as you'll get the best view from there,
and the display takes place on the opposite side of the river.
It's always one of the most popular events in the festival.
Sounds great.
And what's happening on the other days?
There are several events that go on the whole time.
For example, the students of the art college have produced a number of videos,
all connected with relationships between children and their grandparents.
That sounds interesting.
It makes a change from children and parents, doesn't it!
Exactly.
Because the art college is in use for classes, throughout the festival,
the videos are being shown in Handsworth House.
How do you spell the name?
H-A-N-D-S-W-O-R-T-H.
Handsworth House.
It's close to the Town Hall.
Right.
Now let me see, what else can I tell you about?
Are there any displays of ballet dancing?
I'm particularly interested in that as I do it as a hobby.
There isn't any ballet, I'm afraid,
but there'll be a demonstration of traditional dances from all round the country.
Oh, that'd be nice.
Where's that being held?
It's in the market in the town centre - the outdoor one, not the covered market.
And it's on at 2 and 5 every afternoon of the festival, apart from the first day.
Lovely.
I'm interested in all kinds of dancing, so I'm sure I'll enjoy that!
I'm sure you will.
And I'd really like to go to some concerts, if there are any.
Yes, there are several.
Three performed by professionals, and one by local children.
And where is it being held?
It's in the library, which is in Part Street.
On the 18th, at 6.30 in the evening.
I presume I'll need tickets for that.
Yes, you can book online,
or you can buy them when you arrive in Kenton,
either at the festival box office, or from any shops displaying our logo in the windows.
Well, I think that'll keep me busy for the whole of my stay in Kenton.
Thank you so much for all your help.
You're welcome. I hope you enjoy your stay.
Thank you. Goodbye.

1107,Cam12 - Test 2 - Part 2,C1,cam12---test-2---part-2,59,"Right. I've now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour,
so I'll bring you up to date with what I know.
As you know, we're flying first to Munich, on Monday the 4th.
The flight is at 11.30,
so it's too early to have lunch at the airport.
I suggest we meet there for coffee at 10,
which should give us plenty of time for breakfast before we leave home.
When we arrive in Munich, we'll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer.
Claus works for a tour operator, and he'll look after us for the time we'll be in Germany.
He's already liaised with the managers of the theatres we're going to visit,
and he's also arranged for an officer of the National Theatre in Munich
to show us round the theatre one afternoon during our stay.
Now last time we discussed this trip,
I didn't have the precise cost for hotel rooms, but now I have.
The normal rate at the hotel where we're staying is 150 euros a night for a double room.
I'd hoped to get that down to 120 euros,
but in fact I've been able to negotiate a rate of 110.
That'll be reflected in the final payment which you'll need to make by the end of this week.
On Tuesday, the day after our arrival,
I had hoped we could sit in on a rehearsal at one of the theatres,
but unfortunately that's proved very difficult to arrange,
so instead we'll have a coach trip to one of the amazing castles in the mountains south of Munich.
On Tuesday evening, we'll all have dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel.
From talking to you all about your preferences,
it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be too meat-oriented for some of you.
Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant,
but I must confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one,
as we have plenty of opportunities to go to an Italian restaurant at home.
On Wednesday afternoon, the director of the play we're going to see that evening will talk to us at the theatre.
She'll describe the whole process of producing a play,
including how she chose the actors,
and, as the play we're going to see is a modern one, how she worked with the playwright.
Right.
Now I'd just like to make a few points about the plays we're going to see,
partly because it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you!
The play we're seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one,
and we're going to the premiere, so it'll be quite a dressy occasion,
though of course you don't have to dress formally.
I gather it's rather a multimedia production,
with amazing lighting effects and a soundtrack of electronic music,
though unfortunately the playwright is ill and is unlikely to be able to attend.
On Thursday we're seeing a play that was first performed last year,
when it was commissioned to mark a hundred years since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist.
We're going to see a revival of that production, which aroused a lot of interest.
Friday's play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack,
as it'll be in the garden of a palace.
It's a beautiful setting, but I'd better warn you, there won't be much protection from the wind.
On Saturday, we're going by coach to a theatre in another town, not far from Munich.
This will be the opening of a drama festival,
and the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town will be attending.
After the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience,
and there'll be a band playing traditional music of the region.
And after having a day off on Sunday, our final play is on Monday,
and it's in the stunning setting of the old Town Hall,
which dates back to the 14th century.
The performance marks the fifty years that the lead actor has been on stage,
and the play is the one where he made his first professional appearance, all those years ago.
And the day after that, we'll be flying back home.
Now have you got any questions...

1108,Cam12 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam12---test-2---part-3,78,"Oh good morning. You must be James.
I'm Beth Cartwright - please call me Beth.
Thank you.
Now as this is your first tutorial since you started on the Scandinavian Studies course,
I'd like to find out something about you.
Why did you decide to take this course?
Well, my mother is Danish, and although we always lived in England, she used to talk about her home a lot,
and that made me want to visit Denmark.
We hardly ever did, though - my mother usually went on her own.
But whenever her relations or friends were in England they always came to see us.
I see.
So I assume you already speak Danish, one of the languages you'll be studying.
I can get by when I talk to people, though I'm not terribly accurate.
Now you probably know that you'll spend the third year of the course abroad.
Have you had any thoughts about that?
I'm really looking forward to it.
And although Denmark seems the obvious place to go, because of my family connections,
I'd love to spend the time in Iceland.
Oh, I'm sure it can be arranged.
Do you have any plans for when you graduate?
A lot of students go on to take a master's degree.
I think the four years of the undergraduate course will be enough for me.
I'm interested in journalism,
and I quite like the idea of moving to Scandinavia and writing for magazines.
I'd find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most graduates do.
OK.
Now how are you finding the courses you're taking this term, James?
Well, I'm really enjoying the one on Swedish cinema.
That'll continue next term,
but the one on Scandinavian literature that's running at the moment will be replaced by more specialised courses.
Oh, and by the way, if you're interested in watching Danish television programmes -
there's going to be a course on that the term after next.
That sounds good.
Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you have to write in the next few weeks?
Yes, my first choice would be to do something on the Icelandic sagas.
The trouble with that is that a lot of people choose that topic,
and it can be difficult to get hold of the books you'll need.
Why not leave that for another time?
Right.
You might find modern novels or 19th century playwrights interesting.
I've read or seen several plays in translation, so that would be a good idea.
Fine.
I'll put you down for that topic.
Right. So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper?
First I suggest you avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail.
That approach certainly has its place,
but I think you first need to get an understanding of the literature in the context of the society in which it was produced -
who it was written for, how it was published, and so on.
I also think that's more fruitful than placing it within the history of the genre.
OK, that sounds reasonable.
Could I ask for some advice about writing the paper I'm working on about the Vikings?
I have to do that this week, and I'm a bit stuck.
Of course.
Have you decided yet what to write about?
No, I haven't.
There's so much that seems interesting -
Viking settlement in other countries, trade, mythology‚Ä¶
Well, what I suggest is that you read an assignment a student wrote last year, which is kept in the library.
It's short and well focused, and I'm sure you'll find it helpful.
I'll give you the details in a moment.
Textbooks usually cover so many topics, it can be very difficult to choose just one.
OK.
I've got a DVD of the film about the Vikings that came out earlier this year.
Should I watch that again?
If it's the one I am thinking of, hmm, I'd ignore it -
it's more fantasy than reality.
But I've got a recording of a documentary that you should watch.
It makes some interesting and provocative points, which I think will help you to focus your topic.
Right.
So then should I work out an outline?
Yes. Just headings for different sections, at this stage.
And then you should start looking for suitable articles and books to draw on,
and take notes which you organise according to those headings.
I see.
Then put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading.
Make sure that this skeleton makes sense and flows properly, before writing up the paper in full.
OK.
Thanks, that's very helpful.

1109,Cam12 - Test 2 - Part 4,C2,cam12---test-2---part-4,57,"Over the years, attitudes towards workers have changed considerably.
After all, there was a time when workers had no rights at all, and laboured in appalling conditions.
Conditions have improved a lot, but conflict in the workplace is still common.
And human resources managers nowadays need to be able to deal with it when necessary.
What is conflict in the workplace?
Definitions vary, but I'm taking it to refer to a whole range of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable,
from minor, harmless arguments to - at the opposite extreme - physical violence.
Much of this is covered by the term bullying,
by which I mean one or more people behaving abusively or aggressively against another who is in a weaker position.
Although all behaviour like this is a form of conflict, not all conflict can be described in these terms.
As with all human behaviour, there are numerous reasons for it.
But often it's caused by someone who feels the need to show their superiority over someone else,
in order to feel that they aren't at the lowest level in a hierarchy or a group of people.
In some cases one person simply dislikes the other,
on the basis that the personality of one is in some way incompatible with that of the other person.
A general habit of optimism in one person could make them intolerant of a colleague who's constantly pessimistic -
not that that justifies treating them badly, of course.
Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their team than in the company as a whole.
These conflicts are called 'structural',
and could come about, for example, when a sales team believe they are the only people in the business who do any useful work,
and look down on behind-the-scenes administrators.
Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned -
the situation is likely to be very stressful for victims,
resulting in their absence from work, possibly for months.
For the company, if no effort is made to deal with conflict,
it can spiral out of control, and even lead to the breakdown of the business.
Some interesting work with chief executives - CEOs -
has uncovered some of the reasons why they may treat colleagues badly.
Many CEOs combine two opposing characteristics:
confidence - that is, the belief that they're capable of great achievements - with a high level of anxiety,
a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves or by the directors of the company.
This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who questions their decisions.
In a high pressure work environment, such characteristics become problematic.
And it's particularly difficult to tackle the situation
where colleagues, managers and board members are all trying to achieve their own visions.
When they can't agree on strategic issues and on where they see the business going,
there are real problems.
For managers at lower levels within the organisation,
it might seem that an autocratic form of management -
where the chief executive gives orders and everyone else has to obey -
would see more conflict than others.
Interestingly, though, a company with a more democratic business model, can suffer more,
when uncertainty about who to report to leads to conflicting demands.
Now I'll say a little about dealing with the type of conflict that has harmful effects.
Of course the ideal is to prevent it arising in the first place.
A good manager, at any level, will make efforts to earn the respect of the people they work with,
particularly those who report to them.
That will involve politeness in all communications,
and treating them as equals who happen to have a different role within the organisation.
Sometimes, of course, conflict does occur, and can get out of hand.
In such cases the human resources department often gets involved.
However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees human resources as simply a mouthpiece for the chief executive,
then an external mediator might be able to help.
By talking to both sides, and trying to find the truth of what's been happening,
they can build a clear picture of the situation,
and give feedback that both sides will accept,
precisely because they're independent.

1110,Cam12 - Test 3 - Part 1,B1,cam12---test-3---part-1,90,"Hello?
Hi, Susie, it's Paul here.
How are you?
Enjoying your new job?
You're working at the library, aren't you?
Yes.
I started when the library re-opened a month ago.
It's great.
Actually Carol and I have been meaning to join for a while.
Oh, you should.
It doesn't cost anything,
and the new library has all sorts of facilities.
It's not just a place where you borrow books.
For instance, there's an area with comfortable seats where you can sit and read the magazines they have there.
Some people spend the whole morning there.
Wish I had that amount of time to spend!
Yes, you must be pretty busy at present, with the children and everything?
We are, yes.
But we're hoping to get away this summer.
We're thinking of going to Greece.
Well, we've got a much larger section of the library devoted to travel books now,
so you should come and have a look.
I can't remember if there's anything specifically on Greece,
but I should think so.
OK.
Now Carol's organising a project for the history class she teaches at school,
it's about life in the town a hundred years ago.
Do you have anything that might be useful?
Yes, actually we've now got a new section with materials on the history of the town and surrounding region.
Right. I'll tell her.
You can't always find that sort of thing on the internet.
Now in the old library there used to be a separate room with reference books.
It was a really nice quiet room.
Yes. We've put those books in the main part of the library now,
but we do have a room called the community room.
It can be hired out for meetings,
but at other times people can use it to study.
I might use that.
It's hard to find anywhere quiet at home sometimes.
I can't remember how old your son and daughter are‚Ä¶
we've introduced a special section of fiction written specially for teenagers,
but they might be a bit young for that?
Yes, they would be.
Well, we do have lots of activities for younger children.
Yes?
For example we have a Science Club.
At the next meeting, they're going to be doing experiments with stuff that everyone has in the kitchen -
sugar and flour and so on.
They might be interested, yes.
And we have a competition for children called Reading Challenge.
That doesn't begin until after the end of term.
They have to read six books,
and they get a certificate if they manage it.
So that gives them something to do while they're on holiday, instead of getting bored.
That's the idea.
And there's special activities for adults too.
On Friday we have a local author called Tanya Streep,
who's going to be talking about her new novel.
It's called 'Catch the Mouse'
and she based the story on a crime that actually took place here years ago.
Right.
We're not free on Friday, but I'll look out for the book.
Now this probably isn't for you,
but we do have IT support available for members.
We get quite a few older people coming along
who are wanting to get up to speed with computer technology.
It's on Tuesday mornings -
they don't need to make an appointment or anything, they just turn up.
Well, my mother might be interested,
I'll let her know.
OK.
And there's another service which you wouldn't expect from a library,
which is a free medical check-up.
The hospital arranges for someone to come along
and measure the level of sugar in your blood,
and they check cholesterol levels at the same time.
Really?
Yes, but that's only for the over-60s,
so you wouldn't qualify.
OK.
Well, I'll tell my mother, she might be interested.
What other information‚Ä¶
well, we do have a little shop with things like wallcharts and greetings cards,
and also stamps so you can post the cards straightaway, which is really useful.
Yeah.
Well, I'll bring the children round at the weekend and we'll join.
Oh, one more thing - I'll be bringing the car, is there parking available?
Yes, and it's free in the evening and at weekends.
Perfect.
Well, thanks, Susie...

1111,Cam12 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam12---test-3---part-2,62,"In this session in your training day we're going to look at some of the more specialised holidays we offer at BC Travel.
Now, the travel business is very competitive
and it's important to be aware of how the market's changing and developing.
In terms of age groups,
the over-65s are an important market,
and one that's increasing steadily year on year.
The fewest holidays are taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds,
and that figure shows no sign of rising.
The biggest market at present is still the youngest group,
the 16 to 30s,
but this group's also seen the biggest drop over the last few years,
whereas there's a noticeable growth in the number of holidays taken by the 55 to 64-year-olds.
As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned,
bookings there are steady,
but I have to say we haven't seen the increase we expected.
One trend we're noticing with nearly all age groups is the growing popularity of holidays
in which clients do some kind of specialised activity.
I'm not talking here about adventure holidays,
where clients take part in high-risk activities like white water rafting just for the thrill of it.
Activity holidays usually involve rather less high-risk sports, or things like art and music.
They're not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite, in fact.
But they do often take place outside the main tourist centres,
which gives an opportunity for clients to find out more about the local people and customs,
and many say this is one of the most positive features of these holidays.
Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or talent,
but clients often say that more than this,
it's the chance to create lasting relationships with other like-minded people,
that's the main draw.
Let me give you some examples of BC Travel activity holidays.
Our painting holidays take place in four different centres in France and Italy
and they're very popular with clients of all abilities from beginners onwards.
We've got an excellent team of artists to lead the classes -
some of them have been with us from the start, and five additional ones will be joining us this year
so that we can offer a greater number of classes in each centre.
As far as cooking holidays are concerned,
I know a lot of agents offer holidays where clients cook recipes related to one particular country,
usually the one they're staying in, but we focus on dishes from a great many different ones.
Apart from that you'll find the usual emphasis on good quality, organic ingredients -
that's more or less a given nowadays -
and there are generally some meat-free recipes included.
Our photography holidays take place in a wide range of countries from Iceland to Vietnam,
and clients have the opportunity to see some stunning scenery.
Groups are small, no more than eight,
so clients can have one-on-one tuition during the holiday,
and excursions are arranged with fully-trained guides.
At the end of each holiday an exhibition is held of the photographs taken
so that clients can see one another's work and receive valuable feedback from the tutor.
Finally, let me tell you about our fitness holidays.
In Ireland and Italy we run one-week general fitness classes for all ages and levels of fitness.
Clients start the course with a consultation with a trainer,
and together they draw up an individual programme.
As well as improving general fitness,
clients find that they end up losing much of the stress they've built up in their daily lives.
In Greece, we have a two-week holiday for clients who want to do something about their weight.
This has all the features you'd expect, like a personalised diet programme,
but one of its most popular features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach.
People say it's far preferable to being in a gym.
Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco.
One very popular one is the mountain biking holiday.
Bikes are provided and there are different routes according to people's ability.
We offer one which is tailored to the needs of families, which is particularly popular.
OK, so that's about all the time I have today, so...
",https://dailydictation.com/upload/ielts-listening/ielts-cambridge-12-test-3-part-2-2023-05-22-08-13-03/0-ielts-cambridge-12-test-3-part-2.mp3,4,58
1112,Cam12 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam12---test-3---part-3,89,"Dave, I'm worried about our case study.
I've done a bit of reading, but I'm not sure what's involved in actually writing a case study.
I missed the lecture where Dr Baker talked us through it.
OK, well it's quite straightforward.
We've got our focus - that's tourism at the Horton Castle site.
And you said you'd done some reading about it.
Yes, I found some articles and made notes of the main points.
Did you remember to keep a record of where you got the information from?
Sure.
I know what a pain it is when you forget that.
OK, so we can compare what we've read.
Then we have to decide on a particular problem or need at our site.
And then think about who we're going to interview to get more information.
OK.
So who'd that be?
The people who work there?
And presumably some of the tourists too?
Yes, both those groups.
So we'll have to go to the site to do that, I suppose.
But we might also do some of our interviewing away from the site -
we could even contact some people here in the city,
like administrators involved in overseeing tourism.
OK. So we'll need to think about our interview questions and...
fix times and places for the meetings.
It's all going to take a lot of time.
And if we can, we should ask our interviewees if they can bring along some numerical data
that we can add to support our findings.
And photographs?
I think we have plenty of those already.
But Dr Baker also said
we have to establish with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our case study,
or whether they want to be anonymous.
Oh, I wouldn't have thought of that.
OK, once we've got all this information, I suppose we have to analyse it.
Yes, put it all together and choose what's relevant to the problem we're focusing on,
and analyse that carefully to find out if we can identify any trends or regularities there.
That's the main thing at this stage, rather than concentrating on details or lots of facts.
OK. And then once we've analysed that, what next?
Well, then we need to think about what we do with the data we've selected
to make it as clear as possible to our readers.
Things like graphs, or tables, or charts.
Right.
Then the case study itself is mostly quite standard;
we begin by presenting the problem, and giving some background,
then go through the main sections,
but the thing that surprised me is that in a normal report
we'd end with some suggestions to deal with the problem or need we identified,
but in a case study we end up with a question or a series of questions to our readers,
and they decide what ought to be done.
Oh, I hadn't realised that.
So basically, the problem we're addressing in our case study of the Horton Castle site
is why so few tourists are visiting it.
And we'll find out more from our interviews,
but I did find one report on the internet that suggested that one reason might be because...
as far as transport goes, access is difficult.
I read that too, but that report was actually written ten years ago,
when the road there was really bad, but that's been improved now.
And I think there's plenty of fascinating stuff there for a really good day out,
but you'd never realise it from the castle website -
maybe that's the problem.
Yes, it's really dry and boring.
I read somewhere a suggestion that what the castle needs is a visitor centre.
So we could have a look for some information about that on the internet.
What would we need to know?
Well, who'd use it for a start.
It'd be good to know what categories the visitors fell into too,
like school parties or retired people,
but I think we'd have to talk to staff to get that information.
OK. And as we're thinking of suggesting a visitor centre
we'd also have to look at potential problems.
I mean, obviously it wouldn't be cheap to set up.
No, but it could be a really good investment.
And as it's on a historical site it'd need to get special planning permission, I expect.
That might be hard.
Right, especially as the only possible place for it would be at the entrance,
and that's right in front of the castle.
But it could be a good thing for the town of Horton.
At present it's a bit of a ghost town.
Once they've left school and got any skills or qualifications,
the young people all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city,
and the only people left are children and those who've retired.
Right.
Something else we could investigate would be the potential damage that tourists might cause to the castle site,
I mean their environmental impact.
At present the tourists can just wander round wherever they want,
but if numbers increase, there might have to be some restrictions, like sticking to marked ways.
And there'd need to be guides and wardens around to make sure these were enforced.
Yes, we could look at that too.

1113,Cam12 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam12---test-3---part-4,67,"OK, so we've been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife.
Now I'll discuss a particular example.
Let's take a look at mercury.
Mercury's one of the 120 or so elements that make up all matter,
and it has the symbol Hg.
It's a shiny, silvery substance.
You may have seen it in old-fashioned thermometers,
but it's not used much for domestic purposes now
because it's highly toxic.
But the problem is that the amount of mercury in the environment's increasing.
The main reason for this is the power plants used to produce electricity.
The main source of energy that most of them use is still coal,
and when it's burned it releases mercury into the atmosphere.
Some of this gets deposited into lakes and rivers,
and if it's ingested by a fish it's not excreted,
it stays in the fish's body and it enters the food chain.
So it's been known for some time that birds which eat fish may be affected,
but what wasn't known until quite recently is that those that eat insects can also be affected.
So a woman called Claire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting birds.
And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by mercury poisoning,
she's looking for more subtle sub-effects.
And these may be to do with the behaviour of the birds,
or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works,
so whether it leads to problems with memory, for example.
And she's particularly focusing on the effects of mercury on bird song.
Now, the process of song learning happens at a particular stage in the birds' development,
and what you may not know
is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by listening to the songs produced by its father,
rather than by any other bird.
And Varian-Ramos has already found in her research
that if young male birds are exposed to mercury,
if they eat food contaminated with mercury,
then the songs they produce aren't as complex as those produced by other birds.
So quite low-level exposure to mercury is likely to have an impact on male birds in a natural situation,
because it can mean that they're less attractive to female birds,
and so it can affect their chances of reproduction.
Now the way she's carrying out this research is worth thinking about.
She's using a mixture of studies using birds kept in laboratories,
and studies carried out outdoors in the wild.
The lab-based studies have the advantage that you don't get all the variables you would in a natural setting,
so the experimenter has a much higher level of control,
and that means they can be more confident about their results in some ways.
And of course they don't have to worry about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them.
So what are the implications here for humans?
Well, because many birds are migratory,
they may be transporting mercury far from contaminated sites.
For example, it's been found that ducks who'd been feeding at a contaminated site
were later shot by hunters over a thousand kilometres away,
and presumably eaten.
But these birds likely had mercury levels high enough to warrant concern for human consumption.
In addition, going back to song learning by birds,
we saw that this may be affected by mercury contamination.
Well, we also know that in humans,
mercury causes developmental delays in the acquisition of language,
and in fact this process is very similar in the brain regions it involves
and even the genes that are involved.
But mercury contamination has other important implications for humans as well.
It's now known that an unborn child can be affected
if the food eaten by its mother contains high levels of mercury,
and these effects can be quite substantial.
In the end, it comes down to whether more value is placed on human economic wellbeing or environmental wellbeing.
It's true there are new regulations for mercury emissions from power plants,
but these will need billions of dollars to implement,
and increase costs for everyone.
Some argue that's too much to pay to protect wildlife.
But as we've seen, the issues go beyond that,
and I think it's an issue we need to consider very carefully.

1114,Cam12 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam12---test-4---part-1,80,"Hello, Pembroke Cycling Holidays, Bob speaking.
Oh hello.
I've seen your advert for people to lead cycle trips.
Are you the right person to speak to?
Yes, I am.
Could I have your name, please?
It's Margaret Smith.
Are you looking for a permanent job, Margaret?
No, temporary.
I've got a permanent job starting in a few months' time,
and I want to do something else until then.
What work do you do?
This will probably sound crazy - I used to be a lawyer,
and then I made a complete career change and I'm going to be a doctor.
I've just finished my training.
Right.
And have you had any experience of leading cycle trips?
Yes, I've led several bike tours in Africa.
The trip to India that I had arranged to lead next month has now been cancelled,
so when I saw you were advertising for tour leaders, I decided to apply.
OK.
Now we normally have two or three leaders on a trip, depending on the size of the group.
Some tours are for very experienced cyclists,
but we've got a tour coming up soon in Spain,
which is proving so popular we need an additional leader.
It's a cycling holiday for families. Would that suit you?
It certainly would.
I enjoy working with children,
and I probably need some more experience before I go on a really challenging trip.
That tour includes several teenagers;
have you worked with that age group before?
Yes, I'm a volunteer worker in a youth club,
where I help people to improve their cycling skills.
Before that I helped out in a cycling club where I taught beginners.
Well that's great.
Now the trip I mentioned is just for a fortnight,
but there might be the possibility of leading other tours after that.
Would that fit in with your plans?
That'd be fine.
I'll be free for five months.
My job is due to start on October the 2nd,
and I'm available from May the 1st until late September.
Good.
Now is there anything I need to know about the food you eat?
We usually have one or two people in the group who don't eat meat,
or have some sort of food allergy,
so we're always very careful about that.
Yes, I'm allergic to cheese.
Would that be a problem?
No, as long as we have enough notice, we can deal with that.
That's great.
It sounds really interesting!
Would you like me to fill in an application form?
Yes, please.
Where should I post it to?
Could you send it to 27 Arbuthnot Place,
A-R-B-U-T-H-N-O-T - Place, Dumfries.
And what's the postcode, please?
DG7 4PH.
Was that P Papa or B Bravo?
P Papa.
Got that.
If you could return the application form by Friday this week, we can interview you on Tuesday next week.
Say half past two.
Would that be possible for you?
Yes, it's fine.
You're quite a long way from where I live, so I'll drive over on Monday.
Should I bring anything to the interview?
We'll have your application form, of course,
but we'll need to see any certificates you've got that are relevant, in cycling, first aid, or whatever.
OK.
And at the interview we'd like to find out about your experience of being a tour guide,
so could you prepare a 10 minute talk about that, please?
You don't need slides or any complicated equipment - just some notes.
Right. I'll start thinking about that straightaway!
Good.
Well, we'll look forward to receiving your application form, and we'll contact you to confirm the interview.
Thanks very much.
Thank you, Margaret. Goodbye.
Bye.

1115,Cam12 - Test 4 - Part 2,B2,cam12---test-4---part-2,50,"Welcome to this podcast about the Sheepmarket, which is one of the oldest parts of the city.
As its name suggests, there was originally a market here where farmers brought their sheep,
but now it's been redeveloped into a buzzing, vibrant area of the city,
which is also home to one of the city's fastest-growing communities.
The nearby university has always meant the area's popular with students, who come in to enjoy the lively nightlife,
but now graduates embarking on careers in the worlds of fashion and design
are buying up the new apartments recently built here
to replace the small houses where the market workers used to live.
The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures, jewellery and ceramics which won't break the bank,
as well as local produce like fruit and vegetables.
There's also lots of pavement cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from all over the world go by.
The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets,
including the city's first department store, built in the 1880s, which is still open today.
The Sheepmarket is a centre for fashion,
and there's a policy of encouraging new young designers.
The Young Fashion competition is open to local young people who are passionate about fashion.
This year they've been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from the music and technology that's part of their everyday life,
using both natural and man-made fibres.
The garments will be judged by a panel of experts and fashion designers,
and the winning entries will be modelled at a special gala evening.
Parking at the Sheepmarket is easy.
There are plenty of pay and display car parking spaces on the roadsides
which are fine if you just want to stay for an hour or two,
but if you want to spend the day there, it's better to park in one of the four underground car parks.
It's not expensive and if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores, you'll not be charged at all.
After six pm many of the car parks have a flat rate which varies but it is usually very reasonable.
The Sheepmarket is one of the main centres for art and history in the whole of the country.
If you look at our map, you'll see some of the main attractions there.
Most visitors start from Crawley Road, at the bottom of the map.
The Reynolds House is one of the oldest houses in the city, and is open to the public.
It's on the north side of Crawley Road, next to the footpath that leads to the public gardens.
The area's particularly interesting for its unusual sculptures.
The Thumb is just what its name suggests, but it's about 10 metres high.
You'll see it on Hill Road, across the road from the Bank.
The Museum's got a particularly fine collection of New Zealand landscapes.
It's on the east side of the Sheepmarket, on City Road.
It's on the other side of the road from the public gardens, immediately facing the junction with Hill Road.
The Contemporary Art Gallery is on a little road that leads off Station Square, not far from the public gardens.
The road ends at the gallery - it doesn't go anywhere else.
That's open every day except Mondays.
The Warner Gallery specialises in 19th-century art.
It's on City Road, near the junction with Crawley Road,
on the same side of the road as the public gardens.
It's open on weekdays from 9 to 5, and entry is free.
Finally, if you're interested in purchasing high quality artwork,
the place to go is Nucleus.
You need to go from Crawley Road up through Station Square and east along Hill Road
until you get to a small winding road turning off.
Go up there and it's on your right -
if you get to City Road you've gone too far.

1116,Cam12 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam12---test-4---part-3,81,"Joe, you know I'm giving a presentation in our film studies class next week?
Yes.
Well, could we discuss it?
I could do with getting someone else's opinion.
Of course, Katie. What are you going to talk about?
It's about film adaptations of Shakespeare's plays.
I've got very interested in all the different approaches that film directors take.
So I thought I'd start with Giannetti, who's a professor of film and literature,
and in one of his books he came up with a straightforward classification of film adaptations
based on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels.
Right.
I've already made some notes on that,
so I just need to sort those out before the presentation.
I thought that next I'd ask the class to come up with the worst examples of Shakespeare adaptations that they've seen,
and to say why.
That should be more fun than having their favourite versions.
Yes, I can certainly think of a couple!
Right.
Next I want to talk about Rachel Malchow.
I came across something on the internet about her work on film adaptations,
and I was thinking of showing some film clips to illustrate her ideas.
Will you have enough time, though?
Both to prepare and during the presentation?
After all, I doubt if you'll be able to find all the clips you want.
Perhaps you're right.
OK, well, I'd better do some slides instead,
saying how various films relate to what she says.
That should encourage discussion.
Next I want to say something about how plays may be chosen for adaptation
because they're concerned with issues of the time when the film is made.
You mean things like patriotism, or the role of governments?
Exactly.
It's quite tricky, but I've got a few ideas I'd like to discuss.
And finally I want to talk about a few adaptations that I think illustrate a range of approaches,
and make some comments on them.
Do you know the Japanese film Ran?
I haven't seen it.
It was based on Shakespeare's King Lear, wasn't it?
That's right.
It was a very loose adaptation, using the same situation and story,
but moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain.
So for example the king's daughters become sons,
because in Japanese culture at that time, women couldn't succeed to the throne.
OK.
I hope you're going to talk about the 1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing.
I think that's one of the best Shakespeare films.
It really brings the play to life, doesn't it?
Yes, I agree.
And I think filming it in Italy, where the play is set,
makes you see what life was like at the time of the play.
Absolutely. Right, what's next?
Er, next, I thought Romeo & Juliet, the 1996 film,
which moves the action into the present day.
Yes, it worked really well, I thought -
changing the two feuding families in the original to two competing business empires,
even though they're speaking in the English of the original play.
You'd expect it would sound really bizarre,
but I found I soon got used to it.
Me too.
Then I thought I'd include a real Hollywood film,
one that's intended to appeal to a mass commercial audience.
There must be quite a number of those.
Yes, but I've picked the 1996 film of Hamlet.
It included every line of the text,
but it's more like a typical action hero movie -
there are loads of special effects, but no unifying interpretation of the play.
All show and no substance.
Exactly.
Then there's Prospero's Books, based on The Tempest.
That was really innovative, from a stylistic point of view.
Didn't it include dance and singing and animation, as well as live actors?
Yes, it did.
I also want to mention Looking for Richard.
Did you ever see it?
No, but I've read about it.
It was a blend of a documentary with a few scenes from Richard III, wasn't it?
That's right.
It's more a way of looking into how people nowadays connect with the playwright -
the play is really just the starting point.
And that'll be where I finish.
Well, it sounds as though it'll be very interesting.

1117,Cam12 - Test 4 - Part 4,C1,cam12---test-4---part-4,71,"This lecture will be about the science of acoustics, the study of sound,
in relation to urban environments such as cities.
As an acoustic engineer myself,
I think this is an area where we're likely to see great changes.
In the past, researching urban soundscapes was simple.
We measured levels of sound in decibels,
so I used to take my sound meter and I measured the noise somewhere,
and then I might ask a sample of people to say at what level the sound became annoying.
With data like this, acoustic engineers have been able to build up what we call noise maps,
maps of the sound environment.
But actually these aren't a lot of use.
What they do show is that the highest noise levels are generally on roads.
Well, that's not really very surprising.
But there's quite a lot going on that these maps don't show,
because they can't capture the complex way that sound varies over time.
So they ignore important issues such as the noise someone might hear from the open windows
or gardens of their neighbours,
and this sort of noise can be quite significant in summer.
We don't have any databases on this sort of information.
As well as that, these records of sound levels take no account of the fact that people vary in their perceptions of noise -
so someone like me with years of working in acoustics might be very different from you in that regard.
But anyway, even though these noise maps are fairly crude,
they've been useful in providing information
and raising awareness that noise matters,
we need to deal with it and so it's a political matter.
And that's important -
we need rules and regulations because noise can cause all sorts of problems.
Those of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day,
so city-dwellers often suffer from interrupted sleep.
It's also known that noise can lead to a rise in levels of stress,
due to physical changes in the body affecting the composition of the blood.
And there are other problems as well,
for instance if schoolchildren don't have a quiet place to study, their work will suffer.
Now, one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn't differentiate between different types of noise.
Some types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and relaxing
might well score quite highly in decibel levels -
think of the sound made by a fountain in a town square, for example.
That's not necessarily something that we'd want to control or reduce.
So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design.
This is going to be tricky
because just measuring decibel levels isn't going to help us here.
Instead, many researchers are using social science techniques,
studying people's emotional response to sound by using questionnaires and so on.
So what exactly do people want to hear in an urban environment?
Some recent interdisciplinary research has come out with results that at first sight seem contradictory -
a city needs to have a sense of activity, so it needs to be lively,
with sounds like the clack of high heels on a pavement or the hiss of a coffee machine,
but these mustn't be too intrusive,
because at the same time we need to be able to relax.
One of the major problems in achieving this will be getting architects and town planners to use the research.
Apart from studying the basics of acoustics,
these people receive very little training in this area.
But in fact they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to add to the experience of urban living,
whereas at present, they tend to see it as something to be avoided or reduced as far as possible,
or something that's just a job for engineers like the street drainage system.
What's needed is for noise in cities to be regarded as an aesthetic quality,
as something that has the qualities of an art form.
If we acknowledge this, then we urgently need to know what governs it and how designers can work with it.
We need to develop a complex understanding of many factors.
What is the relationship between sound and culture?
What can we learn from disciplines such as psychology about the way that sound interacts with human development and social relationships,
and the way that sound affects our thoughts and feelings?
Can we learn anything from physics about the nature of sound itself?
Today's powerful technologies can also help us.
To show us their ideas and help us to imagine the effect their buildings will have,
architects and town planners already use virtual reality -
but these programs are silent.
In the future such programs could use realistic sounds,
meaning that soundscapes could be explored before being built.
So hopefully, using the best technology we can lay our hands on,
the city of the future will be a pleasure to the ears as well as the eyes.

1118,Cam11 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam11---test-1---part-1,90,"Hello?
Oh, hello.
I wanted to enquire about hiring a room in the Village Hall,
for the evening of September the first.
Let me just see‚Ä¶
Yes, we have both rooms available that evening.
There's our Main Hall - that's got seating for 200 people.
Or there's the Charlton Room‚Ä¶
Sorry?
The Charlton Room - C-H-A-R-L-T-O-N.
That's got seating for up to one hundred.
Well, we're organising a dinner to raise money for a charity,
and we're hoping for at least 150 people,
so I think we'll go for the Main Hall.
How much would that cost?
Let's see.
You wanted it for the evening of September the 1st?
Yes, that's a Saturday.
So from six pm to midnight
that'd be ¬£115.
That's the weekend price, it's ¬£75 on weekdays.
That's all right.
And I have to tell you there's also a deposit of ¬£250,
which is returnable of course as long as there's no damage.
But we do insist that this is paid in cash,
we don't take cards for that.
You can pay the actual rent of the room however you like though - cash, credit card, cheque‚Ä¶
Oh, well I suppose that's OK.
So does the charge include use of tables and chairs and so on?
Oh, yes.
And what about parking?
Yeah, that's all included.
The only thing that isn't included is‚Ä¶
you said you were organising a dinner?
Yeah.
Well, you'll have to pay extra for the kitchen if you want to use that.
It's ¬£25.
It's got very good facilities -
good quality cookers and fridges and so on.
OK, well I suppose that's all right.
We can cover the cost in our entry charges.
Right.
So I'll make a note of that.
Now there are just one or two things you need to think about before the event.
For example, you'll have to see about getting a licence if you're planning to have any music during the meal.
Oh, really?
It's quite straightforward, I'll give you the details later on.
And about a week or ten days before your event you'll need to contact the caretaker, that's Mr Evans,
to make the arrangements for entry -
he'll sort that out with you.
And do I give him the payment as well?
No, you do that directly with me.
Right. Now is there anything I need to know about what happens during the event?
Well, as you'll be aware, of course the building is no smoking throughout.
Of course.
Now, are you having a band?
Yes.
Well, they'll have a lot of equipment,
so rather than using the front door they should park their van round the back
and use the stage door there.
You can open that from inside but don't forget to lock it at the end.
OK.
And talking of bands, I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,
but you must make sure that no one fiddles about with the black box by the fire door -
that's a system that cuts in when the volume reaches a certain level.
It's a legal requirement.
Sure.
Anyway, we want people to be able to talk to one another
so we don't want anything too loud.
Oh, that reminds me, we'll be having speeches.
Are there any microphones available?
Yeah. Just let the caretaker know, he'll get those for you.
Right, now when the event is over we do ask that the premises are left in good condition.
So there's a locked cupboard
and you'll be informed of the code you need to open that.
It's got all the cleaning equipment, brushes and detergent and so on.
Right.
So what do we need to do after everyone's gone?
Sweep the floors I suppose?
Well, actually they have to be washed, not just swept.
Then you'll be provided with black plastic bags,
so all the rubbish must be collected up and left outside the door.
Of course.
We'll make sure everything's left tidy.
Oh, and I forgot to ask,
I presume we can have decorations in the room?
Yes, but you must take them down afterwards.
Sure.
And the chairs and tables should be stacked up neatly at the back of the room.
I'll make sure I've got a few people to help me.

1119,Cam11 - Test 1 - Part 2,B1,cam11---test-1---part-2,55,"Welcome to the Fiddy Working Heritage Farm.
This open-air museum gives you the experience of agriculture and rural life in the English countryside at the end of the 19th century.
So you'll see a typical farm of that period,
and like me, all the staff are dressed in clothes of that time.
I must give you some advice and safety tips before we go any further.
As it's a working farm, please don't frighten or injure the animals.
We have a lot here, and many of them are breeds that are now quite rare.
And do stay at a safe distance from the tools:
some of them have sharp points which can be pretty dangerous,
so please don't touch them.
We don't want any accidents, do we?
The ground is very uneven,
and you might slip if you're wearing sandals
so I'm glad to see you're all wearing shoes -
we always advise people to do that.
Now, children of all ages are very welcome here,
and usually even very young children love the ducks and lambs,
so do bring them along next time you come.
I don't think any of you have brought dogs with you,
but in case you have, I'm afraid they'll have to stay in the car park unless they're guide dogs.
I'm sure you'll understand that they could cause a lot of problems on a farm.
Now let me give you some idea of the layout of the farm.
The building where you bought your tickets is the New Barn, immediately to your right,
and we're now at the beginning of the main path to the farmland -
and of course the car park is on your left.
The scarecrow you can see in the car park in the corner, beside the main path,
is a traditional figure for keeping the birds away from crops,
but our scarecrow is a permanent sculpture.
It's taller than a human being, so you can see it from quite a distance.
If you look ahead of you, you'll see a maze.
It's opposite the New Barn, beside the side path that branches off to the right just over there.
The maze is made out of hedges which are too tall for young children to see over them,
but it's quite small, so you can't get lost in it!
Now, can you see the bridge crossing the fish pool further up the main path?
If you want to go to the caf√©, go towards the bridge and turn right just before it.
Walk along the side path and the caf√©'s on the first bend you come to.
The building was originally the schoolhouse, and it's well over a hundred years old.
As you may know, we run skills workshops here,
where you can learn traditional crafts like woodwork and basket-making.
You can see examples of the work, and talk to someone about the courses, in the Black Barn.
If you take the side path to the right, here, just by the New Barn,
you'll come to the Black Barn just where the path first bends.
Now I mustn't forget to tell you about picnicking,
as I can see some of you have brought your lunch with you.
You can picnic in the field, though do clear up behind you, of course.
Or if you'd prefer a covered picnic area, there's one near the farmyard:
just after you cross the bridge,
there's a covered picnic spot on the right.
And the last thing to mention is Fiddy House itself.
From here you can cross the bridge
then walk along the footpath through the field to the left of the farmyard.
That goes to the house, and it'll give you a lovely view of it.
It's certainly worth a few photographs,
but as it's a private home, I'm afraid you can't go inside.
Right. Well, if you're all ready, we'll set off on our tour of the farm.

1120,Cam11 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam11---test-1---part-3,95,"OK, Greg, so I finally managed to read the article you mentioned -
the one about the study on gender in physics.
About the study of college students done by Akira Miyake and his team?
I was interested that the researchers were actually a mix of psychologists and physicists.
That's an unusual combination.
Yeah.
I got a little confused at first about which students the study was based on.
They weren't actually majoring in physics -
they were majoring in what's known as the STEM disciplines.
That's science, technology, engineering and‚Ä¶ and math.
Yes, but they were all doing physics courses as part of their studies.
That's correct.
So as I understood it,
Miyake and co started from the fact that women are underrepresented
in introductory physics courses at college,
and also that on average,
the women who do enrol on these courses perform more poorly than the men.
No one really knows why this is the case.
Yeah. But what the researchers wanted to find out
was basically what they could do about the relatively low level of the women's results.
But in order to find a solution
they needed to find out more about the nature of the problem.
Right - now let's see if I can remember‚Ä¶
it was that in the physics class,
the female students thought the male students all assumed that women weren't any good at physics‚Ä¶
was that it?
And they thought that the men expected them to get poor results in their tests.
That's what the women thought, and that made them nervous, so they did get poor results.
But actually they were wrong‚Ä¶
No one was making any assumptions about the female students at all.
Anyway, what Miyake's team did was quite simple -
getting the students to do some writing before they went into the physics class.
What did they call it?
Values-affirmation -
they had to write an essay focusing on things that were significant to them,
not particularly to do with the subject they were studying,
but more general things like music or people who mattered to them.
Right.
So the idea of doing the writing is that this gets the students thinking in a positive way.
And putting these thoughts into words can relax them and help them overcome the psychological factors
that lead to poor performance. Yeah.
But what the researchers in the study hadn't expected
was that this one activity raised the women's physics grades from the C to the B range.
A huge change.
Pity it wasn't to an A, but still!
No, but it does suggest that the women were seriously underperforming beforehand, in comparison with the men.
Yes. Mind you, Miyake's article left out a lot of details.
Like, did the students do the writing just once, or several times?
And had they been told why they were doing the writing?
That might have affected the results.
You mean, if they know the researchers thought it might help them to improve,
then they'd just try to fulfill that expectation?
Exactly.
So anyway, I thought for our project we could do a similar study,
but investigate whether it really was the writing activity that had that result.
OK.
So we could ask them to do a writing task about something completely different‚Ä¶
something more factual?
Like a general knowledge topic.
Maybe‚Ä¶
or we could have half the students doing a writing task
and half doing something else, like an oral task.
Or even, half do the same writing task as in the original research
and half do a factual writing task.
Then we'd see if it really is the topic that made the difference, or something else.
That's it. Good.
So at our meeting with the supervisor on Monday
we can tell him we've decided on our project.
We should have our aims ready by then.
I suppose we need to read the original study - the article's just a summary.
And there was another article I read, by Smolinsky.
It was about her research on how women and men perform in mixed teams in class,
compared with single-sex teams and on their own.
Let me guess‚Ä¶ the women were better at teamwork.
That's what I expected,
but actually the men and the women got the same results
whether they were working in teams or on their own.
But I guess it's not that relevant to us.
What worries me anyway is how we're going to get everything done in the time.
We'll be OK now we know what we're doing.
Though I'm not clear how we assess whether the students in our experiment actually make any progress or not‚Ä¶
No.
We may need some advice on that.
The main thing's to make sure we have the right size sample,
not too big or too small.
That shouldn't be difficult.
Right, what do we need to do next?
We could have a look at the timetable for the science classes‚Ä¶
or perhaps we should just make an appointment to see one of the science professors.
That'd be better.
Great.
And we could even get to observe one of the classes.
What for?
Well‚Ä¶ OK maybe let's just go with your idea.
Right, well‚Ä¶

1121,Cam11 - Test 1 - Part 4,C1,cam11---test-1---part-4,74,"I've been looking at ocean biodiversity,
that's the diversity of species that live in the world's oceans.
About 20 years ago,
biologists developed the idea of what they called 'biodiversity hotspots'.
These are the areas which have the greatest mixture of species,
so one example is Madagascar.
These hotspots are significant
because they allow us to locate key areas for focusing efforts at conservation.
Biologists can identify hotspots on land, fairly easily,
but until recently, very little was known about species distribution and diversity in the oceans,
and no one even knew if hotspots existed there.
Then a Canadian biologist called Boris Worm
did some research in 2005 on data on ocean species that he got from the fishing industry.
Worm located five hotspots for large ocean predators like sharks,
and looked at what they had in common.
The main thing he'd expected to find was that they had very high concentrations of food,
but to his surprise that was only true for four of the hotspots -
the remaining hotspot was quite badly off in that regard.
But what he did find was that in all cases,
the water at the surface of the ocean had relatively high temperatures,
even when it was cool at greater depths,
so this seemed to be a factor in supporting a diverse range of these large predators.
However, this wasn't enough on its own,
because he also found that the water needed to have enough oxygen in it -
so these two factors seemed necessary to support the high metabolic rate of these large fish.
A couple of years later, in 2007,
a researcher called Lisa Balance, who was working in California,
also started looking for ocean hotspots, but not for fish -
what she was interested in was marine mammals, things like seals.
And she found three places in the oceans which were hotspots,
and what these had in common was that these hotspots were all located at boundaries between ocean currents,
and this seems to be the sort of place that has lots of the plankton that some of these species feed on.
So now people who want to protect the species that are endangered need to get as much information as possible.
For example, there's an international project called the Census of Marine Life.
They've been surveying oceans all over the world, including the Arctic.
One thing they found there which stunned other researchers
was that there were large numbers of species which live below the ice -
sometimes under a layer up to 20 metres thick.
Some of these species had never been seen before.
They've even found species of octopus living in these conditions.
And other scientists working on the same project,
but researching very different habitats on the ocean floor,
have found large numbers of species congregating around volcanoes,
attracted to them by the warmth and nutrients there.
However, biologists still don't know how serious the threat to their survival is for each individual species.
So a body called the Global Marine Species Assessment is now creating a list of endangered species on land,
so they consider things like the size of the population -
how many members of one species there are in a particular place -
and then they look at their distribution in geographical terms,
although this is quite difficult when you're looking at fish, because they're so mobile,
and then thirdly they calculate the rate at which the decline of the species is happening.
So far only 1,500 species have been assessed,
but they want to increase this figure to 20,000.
For each one they assess,
they use the data they collect on that species to produce a map showing its distribution.
Ultimately they will be able to use these to figure out not only where most species are located
but also where they are most threatened.
So finally, what can be done to retain the diversity of species in the world's oceans?
Firstly, we need to set up more reserves in our oceans,
places where marine species are protected.
We have some, but not enough.
In addition, to preserve species such as leatherback turtles,
which live out in the high seas but have their nesting sites on the American coast,
we need to create corridors for migration,
so they can get from one area to another safely.
As well as this, action needs to be taken to lower the levels of fishing quotas
to prevent overfishing of endangered species.
And finally, there's the problem of 'by-catch'.
This refers to the catching of unwanted fish by fishing boats -
they're returned to the sea, but they're often dead or dying.
If these commercial fishing boats used equipment which was more selective,
so that only the fish wanted for consumption were caught,
this problem could be overcome.
OK. So does anyone have any‚Ä¶

1122,Cam11 - Test 2 - Part 1,B2,cam11---test-2---part-1,92,"Good Morning. Youth Council. Caroline speaking.
Oh, hello, I'm interested in standing for election to the Youth Council,
and I was told to give you a call.
That's good.
Could I have your name, please?
Yes, it's Roger Brown.
Thank you.
I'm Caroline, the Youth Council administrator.
So do you know much about what the Council does, Roger?
I've talked to Stephanie -
I think she's the chair of the Council.
That's right.
And she told me a lot about it.
How it's a way for young people to discuss local issues, for example,
and make suggestions to the town council.
That's what made me interested.
Fine. Well let me take down some of your details.
First of all, how old are you?
You know the Council is for young people aged from 13 to 18?
I've just turned 18.
And where do you live, Roger?
Well, that's a bit complicated.
At the moment I'm looking for a flat to rent here,
so I'm in a hostel from Monday to Friday.
I go back to my parents' place at the weekend.
OK, so where's the best place to send you some information about the Council?
Oh, to my parent's address, please.
That's 17, Buckleigh Street -
B-U-C-K-L-E-I-G-H Street,
Stamford, Lincolnshire,
though you don't really need the county.
Oh, I know Stamford - it's a lovely town.
And what's the postcode?
PE9 7QT.
Right, thank you.
So are you working here, or are you a student?
I started studying at the university a couple of weeks ago,
and I've got a part-time job for a few hours a week.
What do you do?
Well, I've done several different things.
I've just finished a short-term contract as a courier,
and now I'm working as a waiter in one of the big hotels.
That can't leave you much time for studying!
Oh, it's not too bad.
I manage to fit it all in.
What are you studying?
My ambition is to go into parliament eventually,
so my major subject is politics.
That's partly why I think the Youth Council is important and want to be a part of it.
And I suppose you're also taking a minor subject, aren't you?
I know a lot of people study economics too.
I chose history.
To be honest, I'm not finding it as interesting as I expected!
OK, so with your studying and your part-time job,
do you have time for any other interests or hobbies?
Well, I spend quite a lot of time cycling -
both around town to get to university and to work,
and also long-distance, from here to London, for instance.
That's pretty impressive!
Anything else?
For relaxation I'm also keen on the cinema -
I used to go at least once a week, but I can't manage to go so often now.
Right.
Are you sure you'll have enough time for the Youth Council?
Yes, I've worked out that I can afford to reduce my hours at work, and that will make the time.
So is there any particular aspect of the Youth Council's work that appeals to you, Roger?
Well, my sister is blind,
so I'm particularly interested in working with disabled young people,
to try and improve the quality of their lives.
That's great.
Well, the best way to get involved is to be nominated by some people who you know.
Right.
Can you tell me how to set about organising that?
You should talk to Jeffrey, our Elections Officer.
I can arrange a meeting in the council office with him, if you like.
Yes, please.
He'll be here next Monday, if that suits you.
That's the 14th, isn't it?
Yes.
I can manage late afternoon.
Would you like to suggest a time?
He generally leaves around 5.30.
Well, would 4.30 be OK?
My last class finishes at 4, so I'd have plenty of time to get to your office.
Right, that's fine.
Oh, and could I have a phone number we can contact you on?
Yes, my mobile number's 07788136711.
Thank you.
Well, we'll look forward to seeing you next week.
Thanks very much.
Goodbye.
Bye.

1123,Cam11 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam11---test-2---part-2,66,"Hi. Great to see you!
I'm Jody, and I'll be looking after both of you for the first month you're working here at the Amersham Theatre.
I'll tell you something about the theatre now, then take you to meet two of the other staff.
It's an old building, and it's been modernised several times.
In fact, as you can see, we're carrying out a major refurbishment at the moment.
The interior has just been repainted,
and we're about to start on the exterior of the building -
that'll be a big job.
The work's running over budget,
so we've had to postpone installing an elevator.
I hope you're happy running up and down stairs!
When the theatre was built,
people were generally slimmer and shorter than now,
and the seats were very close together.
We've replaced them with larger seats, with more legroom.
This means fewer seats in total,
but we've taken the opportunity to install seats that can easily be moved, to create different acting spaces.
We've also turned a few storerooms over to other purposes like using them for meetings.
We try hard to involve members of the public in the theatre.
One way is by organising backstage tours
so people can be shown round the building and learn how a theatre operates.
These are proving very popular.
What we're finding is that people want to have lunch or a cup of coffee while they're here,
so we're looking into the possibility of opening a caf√© in due course.
We have a bookshop, which specialises in books about drama
and that attracts plenty of customers.
Then there are two large rooms that will be decorated next month,
and they'll be available for hire,
for conferences and private functions, such as parties.
We're also considering hiring out costumes to amateur drama clubs.
Now I want to tell you about our workshops.
We recently started a programme of workshops that anyone can join.
Eventually we intend to run courses in acting,
but we're waiting until we've got the right people in place as trainers.
That's proving more difficult than we'd expected!
There's a big demand to learn about the technical side of putting on a production,
and our lighting workshop has already started with great success.
We're going to start one on sound next month.
A number of people have enquired about workshops on make-up,
and that's something we're considering for the future.
A surprise success is the workshop on making puppets -
we happen to have someone working here who does it as a hobby,
and she offered to run a workshop.
It was so popular we're now running them every month!
Now, a word about the layout of the building.
The auditorium, stage and dressing rooms for the actors are all below ground level.
Here on the ground floor we have most of the rooms that the public doesn't see.
The majority are internal, so they have windows in the roof to light them.
Standing here in the foyer, you're probably wondering why the box office isn't here,
where the public would expect to find it.
Well, you might have noticed it on your way in -
although it's part of this building, it's next door with a separate entrance from the road.
For the theatre manager's office, you go across the foyer and through the double doors,
turn right, and it's the room at the end of the corridor, with the door on the left.
The lighting box is where the computerised stage lighting is operated
and it's at the back of the building.
When you're through the double doors
turn left, turn right at the water cooler, and right again at the end.
It's the second room along that corridor.
The lighting box has a window into the auditorium,
which of course is below us.
The artistic director's office is through the double doors,
turn right and it's the first room you come to on the right-hand side.
And finally, for the moment,
the room where I'll take you next - the relaxation room.
So if you'd like...

1124,Cam11 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam11---test-2---part-3,93,"I've brought my notes on our Biology Field Trip to Rocky Bay, Colin,
so we can work on our report on the research we did together.
OK.
I've got mine too. Let's look at the aims of the trip first.
Right. What did you have?
I just put something about getting experience of the different sorts of procedures used on a field trip.
But we need something about what causes different organisms to choose particular habitats.
I agree.
And something about finding out how to protect organisms in danger of dying out?
In our aims?
But we weren't really looking at that.
I suppose not.
OK, now there's the list of equipment we all had to bring on the field trip.
What did they tell us to bring a ruler for?
It was something about measuring the slope of the shore,
but of course we didn't need it because we were measuring wind direction,
and we'd brought the compass for that‚Ä¶
But not the piece of string to hold up in the air!
Didn't Mr Blake make a fuss about us leaving that behind.
He does go on.
Anyway it was easy to get one from another of the students.
Now, the next section's the procedure.
I sent you the draft of that.
Yeah. And..
It was clear, but I don't think we need all these details of what time we left and what time we got back and...
how we divided up the different research tasks.
OK. I'll look at that again.
Then we have to describe our method of investigation in detail.
So let's begin with how we measured wave speed.
I was surprised how straightforward that was.
I'd expected us to have some sort of high-tech device,
not just stand there and count the number of waves per minute.
Not very precise, but I suppose it was good enough.
But the way we measured the amount of salt was interesting.
In the water from the rock pools?
Yeah.
Oh, I wanted to check the chemicals we used in the lab when we analysed those samples -
was it potassium chromate and silver nitrate?
That's right.
OK.
And we need the map of the seashore.
You just left that to me.
And I had to do it while the tide was low,
well, that was OK, but the place I started it from was down on the beach,
then I realised I should have gone up higher to get better visibility,
so I had to start all over again.
But at least I'd got the squared paper or I'd have had problems drawing it all to scale.
It looks good.
We could get a map of the region off the internet and see if we need to make any changes.
I had a look but I couldn't find anything.
But you took some pictures, didn't you?
Yeah. I'll email you them if you want.
OK.
I'll make my amendments using those, then I can scan it into our report.
Great.
Now when we get to our findings I thought we could divide them up into the different zones we identified on the shore
and the problems organisms face in each zone.
So for the highest area‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶the splash zone?
Yeah, we found mostly those tiny shellfish that have strong hard shells that act as protection.
But not from other organisms that might eat them, predators?
No, that's not the main danger for them.
But the shells prevent them from drying out
because they're in the open air for most of the time.
Right.
And since they're exposed, they need to be able to find some sort of shelter, or cover themselves up, so they don't get too hot.
Then in the middle and lower zones, nearer the sea,
we need to discuss the effects of wave action‚Ä¶
Yes, and how organisms develop structures to prevent themselves from being swept away,
or even destroyed by being smashed against the rocks.
I haven't done anything on the geological changes.
I don't know what to put for that.
No, we weren't concentrating on that.
Maybe we need to find some websites.
Good idea.
I've got the lecture notes from Mr Blake's geology course,
but they're too general.
But we could ask him which books on our Reading List might be most helpful.
Right.
OK, now I did a draft of the section of sources of possible error in our research,
but I don't know if you agree.
For example, the size of the sample, and whether it's big enough to make any general conclusions from.
But I thought actually we did have quite a big sample.
We did.
And our general method of observation seemed quite reliable.
But we might not be all that accurate as far as the actual numbers go.
Yeah, we might have missed some organisms -
if they were hiding under a rock, for example.
I wasn't sure about the way we described their habitats.
I decided it was probably OK.
Yeah, and the descriptions we gave of the smaller organisms,
they weren't very detailed, but they were adequate in this context.
I'm not sure we identified all the species correctly though.
OK, we'd better mention that.

1125,Cam11 - Test 2 - Part 4,C2,cam11---test-2---part-4,57,"We've been discussing the factors the architect has to consider when designing domestic buildings.
I'm going to move on now to consider the design of public buildings,
and I'll illustrate this by referring to the new Taylor Concert Hall that's recently been completed here in the city.
So, as with a domestic building,
when designing a public building, an architect needs to consider the function of the building -
for example, is it to be used primarily for entertainment, or for education, or for administration?
The second thing the architect needs to think about is the context of the building,
this includes its physical location obviously,
but it also includes the social meaning of the building:
how it relates to the people it's built for.
And finally, for important public buildings,
the architect may also be looking for a central symbolic idea on which to base the design,
a sort of metaphor for the building and the way in which it is used.
Let's look at the new Taylor Concert Hall in relation to these ideas.
The location chosen was a site in a run-down district that has been ignored in previous redevelopment plans.
It was occupied by a factory that had been empty for some years.
The whole area was some distance from the high-rise office blocks of the central business district and shopping centre,
but it was only one kilometre from the ring road.
The site itself was bordered to the north by a canal
which had once been used by boats bringing in raw materials when the area was used for manufacturing.
The architect chosen for the project was Tom Harrison.
He found the main design challenge was the location of the site in an area that had no neighbouring buildings of any importance.
To reflect the fact that the significance of the building in this quite run-down location was as yet unknown,
he decided to create a building centred around the idea of a mystery -
something whose meaning still has to be discovered.
So how was this reflected in the design of the building?
Well, Harrison decided to create pedestrian access to the building
and to make use of the presence of water on the site.
As people approach the entrance, they therefore have to cross over a bridge.
He wanted to give people a feeling of suspense
as they see the building first from a distance, and then close-up,
and the initial impression he wanted to create from the shape of the building as a whole was that of a box.
The first side that people see, the southern wall, is just a high, flat wall uninterrupted by any windows.
This might sound off-putting,
but it supports Harrison's concept of the building -
that the person approaching is intrigued and wonders what will be inside.
And this flat wall also has another purpose.
At night-time, projectors are switched on and it functions as a huge screen,
onto which images are projected.
The auditorium itself seats 1500 people.
The floor's supported by ten massive pads.
These are constructed from rubber,
and so are able to absorb any vibrations from outside
and prevent them from affecting the auditorium.
The walls are made of several layers of honey-coloured wood,
all sourced from local beech trees.
In order to improve the acoustic properties of the auditorium and to amplify the sound,
they are not straight, they are curved.
The acoustics are also adjustable according to the size of orchestra and the type of music being played.
In order to achieve this, there are nine movable panels in the ceiling above the orchestra
which are all individually motorized,
and the walls also have curtains which can be opened or closed to change the acoustics.
The reaction of the public to the new building has generally been positive.
However, the evaluation of some critics has been less enthusiastic.
In spite of Harrison's efforts to use local materials,
they criticise the style of the design as being international rather than local,
and say it doesn't reflect features of the landscape or society for which it is built.

1126,Cam11 - Test 3 - Part 1,B1,cam11---test-3---part-1,73,"Good morning. This is Burnham tourist office, Martin speaking.
Oh, hello.
I saw a poster about free things to do in the area,
and it said people should phone you for information.
I'm coming to Burnham with my husband and two children for a few days on June the 27th,
or possibly the 28th,
and I'd like some ideas for things to do on the 29th.
Yes, of course. OK.
Then let's start with a couple of events especially for children.
The art gallery is holding an event called 'Family Welcome' that day,
when there are activities and trails to use throughout the gallery.
That sounds interesting.
What time does it start?
The gallery opens at 10, and the 'Family Welcome' event runs from 10.30 until 2 o'clock.
The gallery stays open until 5.
And several times during the day, they're going to show a short film that the gallery has produced.
It demonstrates how ceramics are made,
and there'll be equipment and materials for children to have a go themselves.
Last time they ran the event, there was a film about painting,
which went down very well with the children,
and they're now working on one about sculpture.
I like the sound of that.
And what other events happen in Burnham?
Well, do you all enjoy listening to music?
Oh, yes.
Well there are several free concerts taking place at different times -
one or two in the morning,
the majority at lunchtime, and a couple in the evening.
And they range from pop music to Latin American.
The Latin American could be fun.
What time is that?
It's being repeated several times, in different places.
They're performing in the central library at 1 o'clock,
then at 4 it's in the City Museum,
and in the evening, at 7.30, there's a longer concert, in the theatre.
Right. I'll suggest that to the rest of the family.
Something else you might be interested in is the boat race along the river.
Oh, yes, do tell me about that.
The race starts at Offord Marina, to the north of Burnham, and goes as far as Summer Pool.
The best place to watch it from is Charlesworth Bridge, though that does get rather crowded.
And who's taking part?
Well, local boat clubs, but the standard is very high.
One of them came first in the West of England regional championship in May this year -
it was the first time a team from Burnham has won.
It means that next year they'll be representing the region in the national championship.
Now I've heard something about Paxton Nature Reserve.
It's a good place for spotting unusual birds, isn't it?
That's right - throughout the year.
There is a lake there, as well as a river,
and they provide a very attractive habitat.
So it's a good idea to bring binoculars if you have them.
And just at the moment you can see various flowers that are pretty unusual -
the soil at Paxton isn't very common.
They're looking good right now.
Right.
My husband will be particularly interested in that.
And there's going to be a talk and slide show about mushrooms -
and you'll be able to go out and pick some afterwards and study the different varieties.
Uhuh. And is it possible for children to swim in the river?
Yes. Part of it has been fenced off to make it safe for children to swim in.
It's very shallow, and there's a lifeguard on duty whenever it's open.
The lake is too deep, so swimming isn't allowed there.
OK, we must remember to bring their swimming things, in case we go to Paxton.
How long does it take to get there by car from Burnham?
About 20 minutes,
but parking is very limited, so it's usually much easier to go by bus -
and it takes about the same time.
Right.
Well. I'll discuss the options with the rest of the family.
Thanks very much for all your help.
You're welcome.
Goodbye.
Bye.

1127,Cam11 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam11---test-3---part-2,65,"First of all, let me thank you all for coming to this public meeting, to discuss the future of our town.
Our first speaker is Shona Ferguson, from Barford town council.
Shone.
Thank you.
First I'll briefly give you some background information,
then I'll be asking you for your comments on developments in the town.
Well, as you don't need me to tell you, Barford has changed a great deal in the last 50 years.
These are some of the main changes.
Fifty years ago, buses linked virtually every part of the town and the neighbouring towns and villages.
Most people used them frequently,
but not now because the bus companies concentrate on just the routes that attract most passengers.
So parts of the town are no longer served by buses.
Even replacing old uncomfortable buses with smart new ones has had little impact on passenger numbers.
It's sometimes said that bus fares are too high,
but in relation to average incomes, fares are not much higher than they were 50 years ago.
Changes in the road network are affecting the town.
The centre was recently closed to traffic on a trial basis, making it much safer for pedestrians.
The impact of this is being measured.
The new cycle paths separating bikes from cars in most main roads,
are being used far more than was expected reducing traffic and improving air quality.
And although the council's attempts to have a bypass constructed have failed,
we haven't given up hope of persuading the government to change its mind.
Shopping in the town centre has changed over the years.
Many of us can remember when the town was crowded with people going shopping.
Numbers have been falling for several years,
despite efforts to attract shoppers, for instance by opening new car parks.
Some people combine shopping with visits to the town's restaurants and caf√©s.
Most shops are small independent stores, which is good,
but many people prefer to use supermarkets and department stores in nearby large towns,
as there are so few well-known chain stores here.
Turning now to medical facilities,
the town is served by family doctors in several medical practices -
fewer than 50 years ago, but each catering for far more patients.
Our hospital closed 15 years ago,
which means journeys to other towns are unavoidable.
On the other hand, there are more dentists than there used to be.
Employment patterns have changed, along with almost everything else.
The number of schools and colleges has increased making that the main employment sector.
Services, such as website design and accountancy, have grown in importance,
and surprisingly, perhaps, manufacturing hasn't seen the decline that has affected it in other parts of the country.
Now I'll very quickly outline current plans for some of the town's facilities,
before asking for your comments.
As you'll know if you regularly use the car park at the railway station, it's usually full.
The railway company applied for permission to replace it with a multi-storey car park,
but that was refused.
Instead, the company has bought some adjoining land, and this will be used to increase the number of parking spaces.
The Grand, the old cinema in the high street will close at the end of the year,
and reopen on a different site.
You've probably seen the building under construction.
The plan is to have three screens with fewer seats, rather than just the one large auditorium in the old cinema.
I expect many of you shop in the indoor market.
It's become more and more shabby-looking,
and because of fears about safety, it was threatened with demolition.
The good news is that it will close for six weeks to be made safe and redecorated,
and the improved building will open in July.
Lots of people use the library, including school and college students who go there to study.
The council has managed to secure funding to keep the library open later into the evening, twice a week.
We would like to enlarge the building in the not-too-distant future,
but this is by no means definite.
There's no limit on access to the nature reserve on the edge of town,
and this will continue to be the case.
What will change, though, is that the council will no longer be in charge of the area.
Instead it will become the responsibility of a national body
that administers most nature reserves in the country.
OK, now...

1128,Cam11 - Test 3 - Part 3,B1,cam11---test-3---part-3,78,"Hello, Helen. Sorry I'm late.
Hi, Jeremy, no problem.
Well we'd better work out where we are on our project, I suppose.
Yeah. I've looked at the drawings you've done for my story, 'The Forest',
and I think they're brilliant - they really create the atmosphere I had in mind when I was writing it.
I'm glad you like them.
There are just a few suggestions I'd like to make.
Go ahead.
Now, I'm not sure about the drawing of the cave -
it's got trees all around it, which is great,
but the drawing's a bit too static, isn't it?
I think it needs some action.
Yes, there's nothing happening.
Perhaps I should add the boy - Malcolm, isn't it?
He would be walking up to it.
Yes, let's have Malcolm in the drawing.
And what about putting in a tiger -
the one that he makes friends with a bit later? Maybe it could be sitting under a tree washing itself.
And the tiger stops in the middle of what it's doing when it sees Malcolm walking past.
That's a good idea.
OK, I'll have a go at that.
Then there's the drawing of the crowd of men and women dancing.
They're just outside the forest, and there's a lot going on.
That's right, you wanted them to be watching a carnival procession, but I thought it would be too crowded.
Do you think it works like this?
Yes, I like what you've done.
The only thing is, could you add Malcolm to it, without changing what's already there.
What about having him sitting on the tree trunk on the right of the picture?
Yes, that would be fine.
And do you want him watching the other people?
No, he's been left out of all the fun, so I'd like him to be crying -
that'll contrast nicely with the next picture,
where he's laughing at the clowns in the carnival.
Right, I'll do that.
And then the drawing of the people ice skating in the forest.
I wasn't too happy with that one.
Because they're supposed to be skating on grass aren't they?
That's right, and it's frozen over.
At the moment it doesn't look quite right.
I see what you mean.
I'll have another go at that.
And I like the wool hats they're wearing.
Maybe you could give each of them a scarf as well.
Yeah, that's easy enough.
They can be streaming out behind the people to suggest they're skating really fast.
Great.
Well that's all on the drawings.
Right.
So you've finished writing your story and I just need to finish illustrating it,
and my story and your drawings are done.
So the next thing is to decide what exactly we need to write about in the report that goes with the stories,
and how we're going to divide the work.
Right, Helen.
What do you think about including a section on how we planned the project as a whole, Jeremy?
That's probably quite important.
Yeah. Well, you've had most of the good ideas so far.
How do you feel about drafting something,
then we can go through it together and discuss it?
OK, that seems reasonable.
And I could include something on how we came up with the ideas for our two stories, couldn't I?
Well, I've started writing something about that,
so why don't you do the same and we can include the two things.
Right.
So what about our interpretation of the stories?
Do we need to write about what we think they show,
like the value of helping other people, all that sort of thing?
That's going to come up later isn't it?
I think everyone in the class is going to read each other's stories
and come up with their own interpretations which we're going to discuss.
Oh, I missed that.
So it isn't going to be part of the report at all?
No.
But we need to write about the illustrations, because they're an essential element of children's experience of reading the stories.
It's probably easiest for you to write that section, as you know more about drawing than I do.
Maybe, but I find it quite hard to write about.
I'd be happier if you did it.
OK.
So when do you think‚Ä¶

1129,Cam11 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam11---test-3---part-4,68,"So what I'm going to talk about to you today is something called Ethnography.
This is a type of research aimed at exploring the way human cultures work.
It was first developed for use in anthropology,
and it's also been used in sociology and communication studies.
So what's it got to do with business, you may ask.
Well, businesses are finding that ethnography can offer them deeper insight into the possible needs of customers,
either present or future,
as well as providing valuable information about their attitudes towards existing products.
And ethnography can also help companies to design new products or services that customers really want.
Let's look at some examples of how ethnographic research works in business.
One team of researchers did a project for a company manufacturing kitchen equipment.
They watched how cooks used measuring cups to measure out things like sugar and flour.
They saw that the cooks had to check and recheck the contents,
because although the measuring cups had numbers inside them,
the cooks couldn't see these easily.
So a new design of cup was developed to overcome this problem,
and it was a top seller.
Another team of ethnographic researchers looked at how cell phones were used in Uganda, in Africa.
They found that people who didn't have their own phones could pay to use the phones of local entrepreneurs.
Because these customers paid in advance for their calls,
they were eager to know how much time they'd spent on the call so far.
So the phone company designed phones for use globally with this added feature.
Ethnographic research has also been carried out in computer companies.
In one company, IT systems administrators were observed for several weeks.
It was found that a large amount of their work involved communicating with colleagues in order to solve problems,
but that they didn't have a standard way of exchanging information from spreadsheets and so on.
So the team came up with an idea for software that would help them to do this.
In another piece of research, a team observed and talked to nurses working in hospitals.
This led to the recognition that the nurses needed to access the computer records of their patients,
no matter where they were.
This led to the development of a portable computer tablet
that allowed the nurses to check records in locations throughout the hospital.
Occasionally, research can be done even in environments where the researchers can't be present.
For example, in one project done for an airline,
respondents used their smartphones to record information during airline trips,
in a study aiming at tracking the emotions of passengers during a flight.
So what makes studies like these different from ordinary research?
Let's look at some of the general principles behind ethnographic research in business.
First of all, the researcher has to be completely open-minded -
he or she hasn't thought up a hypothesis to be tested, as is the case in other types of research.
Instead they wait for the participants in the research to inform them.
As far as choosing the participants themselves is concerned,
that's not really all that different from ordinary research -
the criteria according to which the participants are chosen may be something as simple as the age bracket they fall into,
or the researchers may select them according to their income,
or they might try to find a set of people who all use a particular product, for example.
But it's absolutely crucial to recruit the right people as participants.
As well as the criteria I've mentioned,
they have to be comfortable talking about themselves
and being watched as they go about their activities.
Actually, most researchers say that people open up pretty easily,
maybe because they're often in their own home or workplace.
So what makes this type of research special is that it's not just a matter of sending a questionnaire to the participants,
instead the research is usually based on first-hand observation of what they are doing at the time.
But that doesn't mean that the researcher never talks to the participants.
However, unlike in traditional research,
in this case it's the participant rather than the researchers
who decides what direction the interview will follow.
This means that there's less likelihood of the researcher imposing his or her own ideas on the participant.
But after they've said goodbye to their participants and got back to their office,
the researchers' work isn't finished.
Most researchers estimate that 70 to 80 percent of their time is spent not on the collecting of data but on its analysis -
looking at photos listening to recordings and transcribing them and so on.
The researchers may end up with hundreds of pages of notes.
And to determine what's significant, they don't focus on the sensational things or the unusual things,
instead they try to identify a pattern of some sort in all this data,
and to discern the meaning behind it.
This can result in some compelling insights that can in turn feed back to the whole design process.

1130,Cam11 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam11---test-4---part-1,78,"Good morning. Stretton Festival box office. How can I help you?
Oh, hello.
My family and I are on holiday in the area,
and we've seen some posters about the festival this week.
Could you tell me about some of the events, please?
Of course.
First of all, are there still tickets available for the jazz band on Saturday?
There are, but only ¬£15.
The ¬£12 seats have all been sold.
OK. And the venue is the school, isn't it?
Yes, that's right, the secondary school.
Make sure you don't go to the primary school by mistake!
And there's an additional performer who isn't mentioned on the posters -
Carolyn Hart is going to play with the band.
Oh, I think I've heard her on the radio.
Doesn't she play the oboe, or flute or something?
Yes the flute.
She usually plays with symphony orchestras,
and apparently this is her first time with a jazz band.
Well, I'd certainly like to hear her.
Then the next thing I want to ask about is the duck races -
I saw a poster beside a river. What are they, exactly?
Well, you buy a yellow plastic duck - or as many as you like - they're a pound each.
And you write your name on each one.
There'll be several races, depending on the number of ducks taking part.
And John Stevens, a champion swimmer who lives locally, is going to start the races.
All the ducks will be launched into the river at the back of the cinema,
then they'll float along the river for 500 metres, as far as the railway bridge.
And are there any prizes?
Yes, the first duck in each race to arrive at the finishing line wins its owner free tickets for the concert on the last night of the festival.
You said you can buy a duck?
I'm sure my children will both want one.
They're on sale at a stall in the market.
You can't miss it -
it's got an enormous sign showing a couple of ducks.
OK. I'll go there this afternoon.
I remember walking past there yesterday.
Now could you tell me something about the flower show, please?
Well, admission is free,
and the show is being held in Bythwaite Hall.
Sorry, how do you spell that?
B-Y-T-H-W-A-I-T-E.
Bythwaite.
Is it easy to find?
I'm not very familiar with the town yet.
Oh, you won't have any problem.
It's right in the centre of Stretton.
It's the only old building in the town, so it's easy to recognise.
I know it.
I presume it's open all day.
Yes, but if you'd like to see the prizes being awarded for the best flowers,
you'll need to be there at 5 o'clock.
The prizes are being given by a famous actor, Kevin Shapless.
He lives nearby and gets involved in a lot of community events.
Gosh, I've seen him on TV.
I'll definitely go to the prize-giving.
Right.
I've seen a list of plays that are being performed this week,
and I'd like to know which are suitable for my children,
and which ones my husband and I might go to.
How old are your children?
Five and seven.
What about 'The Mystery of Muldoon'?
That's aimed at five to ten-year-olds.
So if I take my children, I can expect them to enjoy it more than I do?
I think so.
If you'd like something for yourself and your husband and leave your children with a babysitter,
you might like to see 'Fire and Flood' -
it's about events that really happened in Stretton 200 years ago,
and children might find it rather frightening.
Oh, thanks for the warning.
And finally, what about 'Silly Sailor'?
That's a comedy, and it's for young and old.
In fact, it won an award in the Stretton Drama Festival a couple of months ago.
OK.
Well, goodbye, and thanks for all the information.
I'm looking forward to the festival!
Goodbye.

1131,Cam11 - Test 4 - Part 2,B1,cam11---test-4---part-2,55,"Good morning, and welcome to the museum -
one with a remarkable range of exhibits, which I'm sure you'll enjoy.
My name's Greg, and I'll tell you about the various collections as we go around.
But before we go, let me just give you a taste of what we have here.
Well, for one thing, we have a fine collection of twentieth and twenty-first century paintings,
many by very well-known artists.
I'm sure you'll recognise several of the paintings.
This is the gallery that attracts the largest number of visitors,
so it's best to go in early in the day, before the crowds arrive.
Then there are the nineteenth century paintings.
The museum was opened in the middle of that century,
and several of the artists each donated one work - to get the museum started, as it were.
So they're of special interest to us -
we feel closer to them than to other works.
The sculpture gallery has a number of fine exhibits,
but I'm afraid it's currently closed for refurbishment.
You'll need to come back next year to see it properly,
but a number of the sculptures have been moved to other parts of the museum.
'Around the world' is a temporary exhibition -
you've probably seen something about it on TV or in the newspapers.
It's created a great deal of interest, because it presents objects from every continent and many countries,
and provides information about their social context - why they were made, who for, and so on.
Then there's the collection of coins.
This is what you might call a focused, specialist collection,
because all the coins come from this country,
and were produced between two thousand and a thousand years ago.
And many of them were discovered by ordinary people digging their gardens and donated to the museum!
All our porcelain and glass was left to the museum by its founder, when he died in 1878.
And in the terms of his will, we're not allowed to add anything to that collection:
he believed it was perfect in itself, and we don't see any reason to disagree!
OK, that was something about the collections,
and now here's some more practical information, in case you need it.
Most of the museum facilities are downstairs, in the basement,
so you go down the stairs here.
When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you'll find yourself in a sitting area,
with comfortable chairs and sofas
where you can have a rest before continuing your exploration of the museum.
We have a very good restaurant, which serves excellent food all day, in a relaxing atmosphere.
To reach it, when you get to the bottom of the stairs, go straight ahead to the far side of the sitting area,
then turn right into the corridor.
You'll see the door of the restaurant facing you.
If you just want a snack, or if you'd like to eat somewhere with facilities for children,
we also have a caf√©.
When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you'll need to go straight ahead,
turn right into the corridor, and the caf√© is immediately on the right.
And talking about children, there are baby-changing facilities downstairs:
cross the sitting area, continue straight ahead along the corridor on the left
and you and your baby will find the facilities on the left-hand side.
The cloakroom where you should leave coats, umbrellas and any large bags,
is on the left hand side of the sitting area.
It's through the last door before you come to the corridor.
There are toilets on every floor,
but in the basement they're the first rooms on the left when you get down there.
OK, now if you've got anything to leave in the cloakroom,
please do that now, and then we'll start our tour.

1132,Cam11 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam11---test-4---part-3,67,"Hi, Joanna, good to meet you.
Now, before we discuss your new research project.
I'd like to hear something about the psychology study you did last year for your Master's degree.
So how did you choose your subjects for that?
Well, I had six subjects, all professional musicians, and all female.
Three were violinists
and there was also a cello player and a pianist and a flute player.
They were all very highly regarded in the music world
and they'd done quite extensive tours in different continents,
and quite a few had won prizes in competitions as well.
And they were quite young, weren't they?
Yes, between 25 and 29 -
the mean was 27.8.
I wasn't specifically looking for artists who'd produced recordings but...
this is something that's just taken for granted these days, and they all had.
Right.
Now you collected your data through telephone interviews, didn't you?
Yes.
I realised if I was going to interview leading musicians, it'd only be possible over the phone because they're so busy.
I recorded them using a telephone recording adaptor.
I'd been worried about the quality, but it worked out all right.
I managed at least a 30-minute interview with each subject, sometimes longer.
Did doing it on the phone make it more stressful?
I'd thought it might‚Ä¶
it was all quite informal though and in fact they seemed very keen to talk.
And I don't think using the phone meant I got less rich data rather the opposite in fact.
Interesting.
And you were looking at how performers dress for concert performances?
That's right.
My research investigated the way players see their role as a musician
and how this is linked to the type of clothing they decide to wear.
But that focus didn't emerge immediately.
When I started I was more interested in trying to investigate the impact of what was worn on those listening,
and also whether someone like a violinist might adopt a different style of clothing from, say, someone playing the flute or the trumpet.
It's interesting that the choice of dress is up to the individual, isn't it?
Yes, you'd expect there to be rules about it in orchestras, but that's quite rare.
You only had women performers in your study.
Was that because male musicians are less worried about fashion?
I think a lot of the men are very much influenced by fashion,
but in social terms the choices they have are more limited‚Ä¶
they'd really upset audiences if they strayed away from quite narrow boundaries.
Now, popular music has quite different expectations.
Did you read Mike Frost's article about the dress of women performers in popular music...
No.
where he points out that a lot of female singers and musicians in popular music tend to dress down in performances,
and wear less feminine clothes, erm, like jeans instead of skirts,
and he suggests this is because otherwise they'd just be discounted as trivial.
But you could argue they're just wearing what's practical‚Ä¶
I mean, a pop-music concert is usually a pretty energetic affair.
Yes, he doesn't make that point, but I think you're probably right.
I was interested by the effect of the audience at a musical performance when it came to the choice of dress.
The subjects I interviewed felt this was really important.
It's all to do with what we understand by performance as a public event.
They believed the audience had certain expectations
and it was up to them as performers to fulfill these expectations to show a kind of esteem‚Ä¶
they weren't afraid of looking as if they'd made an effort to look good.
I think in the past the audience would have had those expectations of one another too,
but that's not really the case now, not in the UK anyway.
No.
And I also got interested in what sports scientists are doing too, with regard to clothing.
Musicians are quite vulnerable physically, aren't they, because...
the movements they carry out are very intensive and repetitive, so...
I'd imagine some features of sports clothing could safeguard the players from the potentially dangerous effects of this sort of thing.
Yes, but musicians don't really consider it.
They avoid clothing that obviously restricts their movements, but that's as far as they go.
Anyway, coming back to your own research, do you have any idea where you're going from here?
I was thinking of doing a study using an audience...

1133,Cam11 - Test 4 - Part 4,C1,cam11---test-4---part-4,68,"As we saw in the last lecture,
a major cause of climate change is the rapid rise in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the last century.
If we could reduce the amount of CO2,
perhaps the rate of climate change could also be slowed down.
One potential method involves enhancing the role of the soil that plants grow in,
with regard to absorbing CO2.
Rattan Lal, a soil scientist from Ohio State University, in the USA,
claims that the world's agricultural soils could potentially absorb 13% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -
the equivalent of the amount released in the last 30 years.
And research is going on into how this might be achieved.
Lal first came to the idea that soil might be valuable in this way not through an interest in climate change,
but rather out of concern for the land itself and the people dependent on it.
Carbon-rich soil is dark, crumbly and fertile, and retains some water.
But erosion can occur if soil is dry,
which is a likely effect if it contains inadequate amounts of carbon.
Erosion is of course bad for people trying to grow crops or breed animals on that terrain.
In the 1970s and '80s,
Lal was studying soils in Africa so devoid of organic matter
that the ground had become extremely hard, like cement.
There he met a pioneer in the study of global warming,
who suggested that carbon from the soil had moved into the atmosphere.
This is now looking increasingly likely.
Let me explain.
For millions of years, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been regulated, in part,
by a natural partnership between plants and microbes - tiny organisms in the soil.
Plants absorb CO2 from the air
and transform it into sugars and other carbon-based substances.
While a proportion of these carbon products remain in the plant,
some transfer from the roots to fungi and soil microbes,
which store the carbon in the soil.
The invention of agriculture some 10,000 years ago
disrupted these ancient soil-building processes
and led to the loss of carbon from the soil.
When humans started draining the natural topsoil, and ploughing it up for planting,
they exposed the buried carbon to oxygen.
This created carbon dioxide and released it into the air.
And in some places,
grazing by domesticated animals has removed all vegetation, releasing carbon into the air.
Tons of carbon have been stripped from the world's soils - where it's needed -
and pumped into the atmosphere.
So what can be done?
Researchers are now coming up with evidence that even modest changes to farming
can significantly help to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
Some growers have already started using an approach known as regenerative agriculture.
This aims to boost the fertility of soil and keep it moist through established practices.
These include keeping fields planted all year round,
and increasing the variety of plants being grown.
Strategies like these can significantly increase the amount of carbon stored in the soil,
so agricultural researchers are now building a case for their use in combating climate change.
One American investigation into the potential for storing CO2 on agricultural lands is taking place in California.
Soil scientist Whendee Silver of the University of California, Berkeley,
is conducting a first-of-its-kind study on a large cattle farm in the state.
She and her students are testing the effects on carbon storage of the compost that is created from waste -
both agricultural, including manure and cornstalks,
and waste produced in gardens, such as leaves, branches, and lawn trimmings.
In Australia, soil ecologist Christine Jones is testing another promising soil-enrichment strategy.
Jones and 12 farmers are working to build up soil carbon by cultivating grasses that stay green all year round.
Like composting, the approach has already been proved experimentally;
Jones now hopes to show that it can be applied on working farms
and that the resulting carbon capture can be accurately measured.
It's hoped in the future that projects such as these
will demonstrate the role that farmers and other land managers can play in reducing the harmful effects of greenhouse gases.
For example, in countries like the United States,
where most farming operations use large applications of fertiliser,
changing such long-standing habits will require a change of system.
Rattan Lal argues that farmers should receive payment not just for the corn or beef they produce
but also for the carbon they can store in their soil.
Another study being..

1134,Cam10 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam10---test-1---part-1,78,"Good morning. World Tours.
My name is Jamie.
How can I help you?
Good morning.
I want some information on self-drive tours in the USA.
Could you send me a brochure?
Of course.
Could I have your name please?
Andrea Brown.
Thank you.
And your address?
24, Ardleigh Road.
Can you spell that?
A-R-D-L-E-I-G-H Road.
Postcode?
BH52OP
Thanks.
And can I have your phone number?
Is a mobile alright?
Fine.
It's 07786643091.
Thank you.
And can I ask you where you heard about World Tours?
From a friend? Or did you see an advert somewhere?
No, I read about you in the newspaper.
OK, I'll get the brochures in the post to you but can I give you some information over the phone.
What kinds of things do you want to do on your holiday?
I'm interested in going to California with my family.
I've got two children and we want to hire a car.
OK.
We have a couple of self-drive tours there visiting different places of interest in California.
The first one begins in Los Angeles and there's plenty of time to visit some of the theme parks there.
That's something on my children's list so I'd want to include that.
Good. Then you drive to San Francisco.
From San Francisco you can drive to Yosemite Park where you spend a couple of nights.
You can choose to stay in a lodge or on the campsite.
I don't like the idea of staying in a tent.
It'd be too hot.
Right.
And the tour ends in Las Vegas.
OK.
The other trip we can arrange is slightly different.
It starts in San Francisco.
Then you drive south to Cambria.
Someone told me there's a really nice castle near Cambria.
Will we go near that?
Hearst Castle is on that road so you could stop there.
Good. I'd like to do that.
Does this trip also go into the desert?
No, it continues to Santa Monica where most people like to stop and do some shopping.
We have enough of that at home so that doesn't interest us.
OK. Well you could go straight on to San Diego.
That's good for beaches isn't it?
That's right, that's a good place to relax and your children might like to visit the zoo before flying home.
I don't think so.
We want some time for sunbathing and swimming.
So how many days are the trips and how much do they cost?
The first one I told you about is a self-drive tour through California
which lasts twelve days and covers 2,020 kilometres.
The shortest journey is 206 kilometres
and the longest is 632 kilometres.
The cost is ¬£525 per person.
That includes accommodation, car rental and a flight but no meals.
OK. And the other trip?
That lasts nine days but you spend only three days on the road.
You cover about 980 kilometres altogether.
So is that cheaper then?
Yes, it's almost a hundred pounds cheaper.
It's ¬£429 per person, which is a good deal.
So that covers accommodation and car hire.
What about flights?
They aren't included.
But these hotels offer dinner in the price.
OK. Well, thank you very much.
I'll be in touch when I've had a chance to look at the brochure.
I'm pleased to help.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

1135,Cam10 - Test 1 - Part 2,B2,cam10---test-1---part-2,52,"On behalf of LP Clubs, I'd like to welcome you all here today.
My name's Sandy Fisher and I'm one of the fitness managers here.
Before we start our tour of the club
I'll just run through some basic information about the facilities we have here,
including recent improvements, and explain the types of membership available.
Our greatest asset is probably our swimming pool
which at 25 metres isn't Olympic-sized,
but now we've expanded it to eight lanes, it's much wider.
This means there are rarely more than a couple of people at a time in each lane.
Unfortunately, there isn't space for an outdoor pool here
but the glass roof on the swimming pool is partly retractable,
which means you can enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days.
Our recently refurbished fitness suite has all the latest exercise equipment
including ten new running machines, and a wide range of weight-training machines.
Each member is given full training in how to operate the equipment
and there is always a trainer on duty to offer help and advice.
Although we do have adult-only times after 6 and at certain times at weekends,
children are well catered for.
Older children continue to benefit from a wide range of tuition;
anything from trampolining to yoga.
One thing all our members appreciate about us is that we take very good care of them.
This starts on day one with your personal assessment.
You are asked to fill in a questionnaire giving details of any health problems.
One of our personal trainers will then go through this with you.
The trainer will then take you through the safety rules for using the equipment in the fitness suite.
During your next exercise session, a personal trainer will work with you to make sure you understand these.
It's very important to do this because we really do want to avoid having any sports injuries.
There's a lot more to looking after yourself than simply lifting weights!
At the end of the personal assessment,
the trainer will draw up a plan, outlining what you should try to achieve within a six-week period.
This will then be reviewed at the end of the six weeks.
Now, I'll just quickly run through the types of membership we have available.
All members must pay a joining fee of ¬£90
in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees.
Gold membership entitles you to free entry at all LP Clubs.
There are now LP clubs in all major cities and towns
so if you travel a lot, this will be a great advantage.
Individual gold membership costs ¬£50 a month
and joint membership for you and your partner will cost ¬£75.
Premier membership is for professional people
whose work commitments make it difficult for them to use the club during the day
and so LP gives booking preferences to Premier members at peak times.
This means you will find it easier to book the sessions at times that suit you.
Reciprocal arrangements with other LP Clubs are available to Premier members.
Premier membership is for individuals only,
but you will be sent passes for guests every month.
The monthly fee is ¬£65.
You don't have to have any special clothes or equipment when you visit the club.
We provide robes and hairdryers in the changing rooms,
but it's very important to remember your photo card
because you won't be able to get in without it.
For people who aren't working...

1136,Cam10 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam10---test-1---part-3,78,"Erm‚Ä¶ hello Professor, I'm John Wishart.
I'm working on my entry for the Global Design Competition.
My tutor said you might be able to help me with it.
Ah, yes, I got a copy of your drawings.
Come in and tell me about it.
What sort of competition is it?
Well, it's an international design competition
and we have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic kitchen appliance.
I see, and are there any special conditions? Does it have to save energy for example?
Actually that was the focus in last year's competition.
This year's different.
We have to adopt an innovative approach to existing technology,
using it in a way that hasn't been thought of before.
I see, that sounds tricky.
And what kitchen appliance have you chosen?
Well, I decided to choose the dishwasher.
Interesting, what made you choose that?
Well, they're an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses
but they're all pretty boring and almost identical to each other.
I think some people will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different.
That's a nice idea.
I see you've called your design 'the Rockpool'; why is that?
Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach.
The top is made of glass so that you can look down into it.
And there's a stone at the bottom.
Is that just for decoration?
Actually it does have a function.
Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone.
So it's really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher.
That's right.
It's a really nice design, but what makes it innovative?
Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses carbon dioxide.
In place of water and detergent?
How will you manage that?
The idea is to pressurize the carbon dioxide so that it becomes a liquid.
The fluid is then released into the dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.
Sounds like a brilliant idea!
Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents.
So what happens once the dishes are clean?
Well, to allow them to dry,
the liquid carbon dioxide and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding chamber.
That's where the liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a gas.
Then the oil and grease are separated out and sent to the waste system.
It sounds like you've thought it all out very thoroughly.
So, what happens to the carbon dioxide once the process is complete?
Not wasted I hope.
Actually, that's where the real savings are made.
The carbon dioxide is sent back to the cylinder and can be used again and again.
What a terrific idea.
Do you think it will ever be built?
Probably not, but that's OK.
Well, I'm sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.
Now, you seem to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with?
Well, my design has made it to the final stage of the competition
and, in a few months' time. I have to give a presentation,
and that's the part I was hoping you could help me with.
Right, well that should be easy enough.
What have you managed to do so far?
Well, I've got detailed drawings to show how it will work
and I've also written a 500-word paper on it.
I see.
Well, if you want to stand a good chance of winning you really need a model of the machine.
Yes, I thought I might but I'm having a few problems.
What is the main difficulty so far?
Let me guess - is it the materials?
Yes.
I want it to look professional but everything that's top quality is also very expensive.
Look, projects like this are very important to us.
They really help lift our profile.
So why don't you talk to the university about a grant?
I can help you fill out the application forms if you like.
That would be great.
You'd better show me this paper you've written as well.
For a global competition such as this
you need to make sure the technical details you've given are accurate and thorough.
Oh, that would be a great help.
Is there anything else I can do?
Well, I'm really‚Ä¶

1137,Cam10 - Test 1 - Part 4,B2,cam10---test-1---part-4,50,"Today we continue our series on ecology and conservation
with a look at a particularly endangered member of the black bear family.
One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat,
which is the result of a special gene that surfaces in a few.
Local people have named it 'the spirit bear'.
And according to the legends of these communities,
its snowy fur brings with it a special power.
Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them -
so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else.
It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area.
The white bear's habitat is quite interesting.
The bear's strong relationship with the old-growth rainforest is a complex one.
The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways.
For example, the old-growth trees have extremely long roots
that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams.
Keeping these banks intact is important
because these streams are home to salmon,
which are the bear's main food source.
In return, the bear's feeding habits nurture the forest.
As the bears eat the salmon,
they discard the skin and bones in great amounts on the forest floor,
which provide vital nutrients.
These produce lush vegetation that sustains thousands of other types of life forms,
from birds to insects and more.
Today, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands.
There is great concern for their survival
since it is estimated that less than 200 of these white bears remain.
The best way to protect them is to make every effort to preserve the delicate balance of their forest environment -
in other words, their ecosystem.
The greatest threat to the bear's existence is the loss of its habitat.
Over many years, logging companies have stripped the land by cutting down a large number of trees.
In addition, they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the bear usually feeds,
and many hibernation sites have also been lost.
The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bears fish.
To make matters worse,
the number of salmon in those streams is declining
because there is no legal limit on fishing at the moment.
All these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear's very existence,
which is made all the more fragile
by the fact that reproduction among these bears has always been disappointingly low.
And so, what's the situation going forward?
Community organizations, environmental groups and the British Columbia government
are now working together on the problem.
The government is now requiring logging companies
to adopt a better logging method, which is a positive step.
However, these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the future.
Other steps also need to be taken.
While it is important to maintain the spirit bear's habitat,
there also needs to be more emphasis on its expansion.
The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their homes‚Ä¶

1138,Cam10 - Test 2 - Part 1,B1,cam10---test-2---part-1,61,"Excuse me.
Yes?
I wonder if you could spare a few minutes to do a survey on transport. It won't take long.
No, that's fine.
Oh, lovely.
The survey is on behalf of the local council.
They'd like to know about what transport you use and any suggestions for improvement.
Can I start by asking you how you travelled to town today?
Sure. I came on the bus.
Great. Now can I get a few details about yourself?
OK.
What's your name?
It's Luisa‚Ä¶
Yes.
Hardie.
Can you spell that, please?
Yes, it's H-A-R-D-I-E.
Great. Thanks. And can I have your address?
It's 19, White Stone Road.
Oh, right. I know that area. It's Bradfield, isn't it?
That's right.
Is the postcode GT7?
It's actually GT82LC.
Great. And could I ask what your job is?
Are you a student?
I've actually just finished my training.
I'm a hairdresser.
Oh, right.
And one more question in this section.
What is the reason for you coming into town today?
Actually it's not for shopping today, which would be my normal reason,
but to see the dentist.
Right. Thanks.
Now in this last section I'd like you to give us some ideas about the facilities and arrangements in the city for getting to and from work,
Any suggestions you have for improvements?
Well, something I've thought about for some time is that when I do walk and I'm doing a later shift,
I think the lighting should be better.
Yes, good point.
And of course, I think it's a real shame they've been cutting down on the number of footpaths.
They should have more of those.
Then people would walk more.
Yes, right.
And, I don't think there are enough trains.
That's why I don't use them - you have to wait so long.
Thanks.
And finally I'd like to ask your opinion on cycling.
As you may know, there's a drive in the city to get more people to cycle to work.
Right.
But we realise that there are things which the council, but also employers, might do to help encourage workers to cycle to work.
Yep.
Well, I have thought about it and where I work there are no safe places to leave your bikes.
OK.
And also, I'd have to cycle uphill
and on a hot day I'd arrive at work pretty sweaty so I think I'd need a shower somewhere at work.
Right.
And I suppose the last thing is that I wouldn't be all that confident about cycling on such busy roads.
I think I'd like to see you offering training for that, you know.
I'd feel a lot better about starting if that was the case.
Well, that's very helpful.
Thank you very much for your time.
No problem. Bye.

1139,Cam10 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam10---test-2---part-2,56,"Good morning.
I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments in the city:
the Brackenside Open-Air Swimming Pool
and the children's Adventure Playground in Central Park.
As many of you may know,
the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public,
in the extensive consultation exercise which the City Council conducted last year.
And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC -
the South West Regional Development Commission.
First of all, Brackenside Pool.
As many of the older members of the audience will remember,
there used to be a wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 years ago
but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe.
For the design of this new heated pool,
we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally renowned architect Ellen Wendon,
who has managed to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits in so well with many of the other buildings in the area,
with up-to-the-minute features such as a recycling system -
the only one of its kind in the world - which enables seawater to be used in the pool.
Now, there has been quite a bit of discussion in the local press
about whether there would be enough room for the number of visitors we're hoping to attract,
but the design is deceptive and there have been rigorous checks about capacity.
Also, just in case you were wondering,
we're on schedule for a June 15th opening date and well within budget:
a testimony to the excellent work of local contractors Hickman's.
We hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th.
We have engaged award-winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open
and there'll be drinks and snacks available at the pool side.
There'll also be a competition for the public to decide on the sculpture we plan to have at the entrance:
you will decide which famous historical figure from the city we should have.
And now, moving on to the Central Park Playground,
which we're pleased to announce has just won the Douglas Award for safety:
the news came through only last week.
The unique design is based on the concept of the Global Village,
with the playground being divided into 6 areas showing different parts of the world -
each with a representative feature.
For example, there is a section on Asia,
and this is represented by rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orang-utans, tigers and so on -
fauna native to the forests of the region.
Moving south to the Antarctic -
we couldn't run to an ice rink I'm afraid
but opted instead for climbing blocks in the shape of mountains -
I thought they could have had slides for the glaciers but the designers did want to avoid being too literal!
Then on to South America -
and here the theme is El Dorado -
games replicating the search for mines full of precious stones.
And then moving up to North America,
here there was considerable debate -
I know the contribution of cinema and jazz was considered
but the designers finally opted for rockets and the international Space Station.
Eastwards to Europe then, and perhaps the most traditional choice of all the areas:
medieval castles and other fortifications.
Then last, but not least, moving south to Africa
and a whole set of wonderful mosaics and trails to represent the great rivers of this fascinating and varied continent.
Now, the opening date for our Global Playground is the 10th of July.
And again we'd love to see you there -
so make a date and come and see this magnificent, original new amenity right in the heart of the city.

1140,Cam10 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam10---test-2---part-3,77,"Right, well, for our presentation shall I start with the early life of Thor Heyerdahl?
Sure.
Why don't you begin with describing the type of boy he was,
especially his passion for collecting things.
That's right, he had his own little museum.
And I think it's unusual for children to develop their own values and not join in their parents' hobbies;
I'm thinking of how Heyerdahl wouldn't go hunting with his dad, for example.
Yeah, he preferred to learn about nature by listening to his mother read to him.
And quite early on he knew he wanted to become an explorer when he grew up.
That came from his camping trips he went on in Norway I think‚Ä¶
No, it was climbing that he spent his time on as a young man.
Oh, right‚Ä¶
After university he married a classmate
and together, they decided to experience living on a small island,
to find out how harsh weather conditions shaped people's lifestyles.
As part of their preparation before they left home,
they learnt basic survival skills like building a shelter.
I guess they needed that knowledge in order to live wild in a remote location
with few inhabitants, cut off by the sea,
which is what they were aiming to do.
An important part of your talk should be the radical theory Heyerdahl formed from examining mysterious ancient carvings
that he happened to find on the island.
I think you should finish with that.
OK.
All right, Victor, so after your part
I'll talk about Thor Heyerdahl's adult life,
continuing from the theory he had about Polynesian migration:
Up until that time of course,
academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west.
Yes, they thought that travel from the east was impossible,
because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest inhabited land.
Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible.
And another argument was that there was no tradition of large ship-building in the communities lying to the east of Polynesia.
But Heyerdahl knew they made lots of coastal voyages in locally built canoes.
Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long voyage that Heyerdahl did next.
It was an incredibly risky journey to undertake -
sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know?
To show others that he could have spectacular adventures.
What do you think, Olivia?
Well, I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea,
to see if migration from the east was possible.
Yes, that's probably it.
And the poor guy suffered a bit at that time because the war forced him to stop his work for some years‚Ä¶
Yes.
When he got started again and planned his epic voyage,
do you think it was important to him that he achieve it before anyone else did?
I haven't read anywhere that that was his motivation.
The most important factor seems to have been that he use only ancient techniques and local materials to build his raft.
Yes.
I wonder how fast it went.
Well, it took them 97 days from South America to the Pacific Islands.
And after that, Heyerdahl went to Easter Island, didn't he?
We should mention the purpose of that trip.
I think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds.
No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia.
Oh, yes, that's right.
But what he wanted to do was talk to the local people about their old stone carvings
and then make one himself to learn more about the process.
I see.
Well, what a great life.
Even though many of his theories have been disproven,
he certainly left a lasting impression on many disciplines, didn't he?
To my mind, he was the first person to establish what modern academics call practical archaeology.
I mean, that they try to recreate something from the past today,
like he did with his raft trip.
It's unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians originated from have been completely discredited.
Yes.
Right, well, I'll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources.
I mainly used The Life and Work of Thor Heyerdahl by William Oliver.
I thought the research methods he used were very sound,
although I must say I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned.
I think they need to do a new, revised edition.
Yeah, I agree.
What about the subject matter - I found it really challenging!
Well, it's a complex issue‚Ä¶
I thought the book had lots of good points.
What did you think of‚Ä¶
",https://dailydictation.com/upload/ielts-listening/ielts-cambridge-10-test-2-part-3-2023-06-13-22-03-12/0-ielts-cambridge-10-test-2-part-3.mp3,4,60
1141,Cam10 - Test 2 - Part 4,C1,cam10---test-2---part-4,58,"Well, I've been talking to managers in a number of businesses,
and reading surveys about the future of management.
And what I'm going to present in this seminar
is a few ideas about how the activity is likely to change in the next ten years.
It isn't a scientific, statistical analysis -
just some ideas for us to discuss.
One area I want to mention is business markets,
and I'm sure a really significant development will be a major increase in competition,
with companies from all around the world trying to sell similar products.
Consumers will have much more choice,
for instance, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in the USA, China, Finland and dozens of other countries.
At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are actually losing power to major global corporations.
We can probably all think of companies that exert a great deal of influence,
which may be good for consumers.
A third point I want to make about markets
is that in the rapidly expanding economies,
such as India, China, Brazil and Russia,
demand is growing very fast.
This is putting pressure on resources all over the world.
I think businesses are becoming more open to external influences.
In particular, companies are consulting customers more and more before making their business decisions.
Companies are finding out what they want and providing it,
instead of making products and then trying to sell them,
which is the model of years ago.
Another influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers to extend product lifecycles,
to reduce the amount of pollution and waste.
And in some cases, regulation will need to be strengthened.
Many societies are much more fluid and democratic,
and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that.
I think we're going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind.
And when they're completed,
the teams will be disbanded and new ones formed.
More and more people see work as simply one part of their lifestyle,
and not the most important one,
and as the workforce is shrinking in some countries,
businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being able to choose among a lot of applicants.
Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible hours and -
something that has been made possible by advances in technology - remote working,
with people based at their home, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose.
Management styles will almost certainly continue to change.
Senior managers will require a lot more than the efficiency that they've always needed.
Above all they'll need great skills in leadership,
so that their organisation can initiate and respond to change in a fast-moving world,
where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts.
In most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties.
The predominant style of management will almost certainly become more consultative and collaborative,
caused above all, by more women moving into senior management positions.
Many of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy.
The traditional emphasis of business was manufacturing,
and of course the service sector is very important.
But we shouldn't overlook the growing financial contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property.
Some books and films generate enormous sums from the sale of related DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on.
Another point I'd like to make is that although I've been talking about companies,
one trend that they have to face is the move away from people working for the same employer for years.
Instead, more and more people are becoming self-employed,
to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they're unlikely to get from being employed.
OK, well that's all I want to say,
so let's open it up for discussion.

1142,Cam10 - Test 3 - Part 1,B1,cam10---test-3---part-1,85,"Good morning.
Welcome to the Early Learning Childcare Centre.
How may I help you?
Hi. I spoke to you last week about enrolling my daughter for next year.
Oh, yes.
I'll just get some details from you.
So, you're her mother?
That's right.
And, can I have your name?
It's Carol, Carol Smith.
And your daughter's name?
It's Kate.
Now, we have several groups at the centre and we cater for children from three to five years old.
How old is your daughter?
She's three now but she turns four next month.
I'll put four down because that's how old she'll be when she starts.
Fine, she's so excited about her birthday and coming to the centre.
Aw, that's good to hear.
And what's your address?
It's 46 Wombat Road,
that's W-O-M-B-A-T.
Woodside 4032.
And what's the phone number?
Oh‚Ä¶ it's‚Ä¶ 3345 9865.
So, have you decided on the days you'd like to bring your daughter here?
I'd prefer Monday and Wednesday if possible.
Mmm. I'll check,
Monday's fine, but I think the centre is already full for Wednesday.
Erm. Yes. Sorry. It seems to be a very popular day.
We can offer you a Thursday or a Friday as well.
Oh dear.
I suppose Thursday would be all right because she has swimming on Friday.
OK, got that.
Because a lot of parents work, we do offer flexible start and finish times.
We are open from 7:30 in the morning until 6 o'clock at night.
What time would you like your daughter to start?
I need to get to work in the city by 9:00 so I'll drop her off at 8:30.
You're pretty close to the city here so that should give me plenty of time to get there.
That's fine.
Now, we also need to decide which group she'll be in.
we have two different groups and they're divided up according to age.
There's the green group.
Which is for three- to four-year-olds.
And then there's the red group which is for four- to five-year-olds.
She's quite mature for her age and she can already write her name and read a little.
Well, I'll put her in the red group
and we can always change her to the green one if there are any problems.
That sounds fine.
OK.
Let's move on to meals.
We can provide breakfast, lunch and dinner.
As she's finishing pretty early, she won't need dinner,
will you give her breakfast before she comes?
Yes, she'll only need lunch.
Now, does she have any medical conditions we need to know about?
Does she have asthma or any hearing problems for example?
No. But she does need to wear glasses.
Oh, I'll make a note of that.
Yes, she's pretty good about wearing them, she can't see much without them.
Right. OK.
Now, I also need emergency contact details.
So what sort of information do you need?
Just the name and number of a friend or family member we can contact in case we can't get hold of you at any time.
OK.
That'd better be my sister‚Ä¶ Jenny Ball.
That's B-A-L-L.
Her phone number is 33467523.
Great.
So she is the child's aunt?
Yes, that's right.
I'll make a note of that as well.
Now, is there anything you'd like to ask?
What about payment?
How much are the fees each term?
Well, for two days and the hours you've chosen,
that will be $450 altogether.
OK, and do I have to pay that now?
No, we send out invoices once the children start at the centre.
You can choose to pay at the end of each term or...
we do offer a slightly discounted rate if you pay every month.
Oh, I'll do that then.
I find it easier to budget that way and I'm not used to the term dates just yet.
Good, it makes it a lot simpler for us as well.
Well, that's everything.
Would you like me to show you around‚Ä¶?

1143,Cam10 - Test 3 - Part 2,B1,cam10---test-3---part-2,63,"Today we're pleased to have on the show Alice Bussell from the Dolphin Conservation Trust.
Tell us about the Trust, Alice.
Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the world.
It tries to raise people's awareness of the problems these marine creatures are suffering
because of pollution and other threats.
It started ten years ago and it's one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country -
although it's still fairly small compared with the big players in animal protection.
We are particularly proud of the work we do in education -
last year we visited a huge number of schools in different parts of the country,
going round to talk to children and young people aged from five to eighteen.
In fact, about thirty-five per cent of our members are children.
The charity uses its money to support campaigns -
for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth.
It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist - with dolphin expertise - to monitor populations.
Of course, many people give their services on a voluntary basis
and we now have volunteers working in observation, office work and other things.
I should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year - for our work in education.
Although it's not meant an enormous amount of money for us,
it has made our activities even more widely publicised and understood.
In the long term it may not bring in extra members
but we're hoping it'll have this effect.
Is it possible to see dolphins in UK waters?
Yes. In several locations.
And we have a big project in the east part of Scotland.
This has long been a haven for dolphins because it has very little shipping.
However, that may be about to change soon
because oil companies want to increase exploration there.
We're campaigning against this
because, although there'll be little pollution from oil,
exploration creates a lot of underwater noise.
It means the dolphins can't rest and socialise.
This is how I became interested in dolphin conservation in the first place.
I had never seen one and I hadn't been particularly interested in them at school.
Then I came across this story about a family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth
because of the oil companies and about a child who campaigned to save them.
I couldn't put the book down - I was hooked.
I'm sure our listeners will want to find out what they can do to help.
You mentioned the 'Adopt a Dolphin' scheme.
Can you tell us about that?
Of course!
People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor.
They receive a picture of it and news updates.
I'd like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members:
Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson.
Unfortunately, Echo is being rather elusive this year and hasn't yet been sighted by our observers
but we remain optimistic that he'll be out there soon.
All the others have been out in force -
Samson and Moondancer are often photographed together
but it is Kiwi who's our real 'character' as she seems to love coming up close for the cameras
and we've captured her on film hundreds of times.
They all have their own personalities -
Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly,
whereas Samson has a lot of energy -
he's always leaping out of the water with great vigour.
You'd probably expect him to be the youngest -
he's not quite - that's Kiwi -
but Samson's the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme.
Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway.
Echo and Moondancer are noisy too,
but Moondancer's easy to find because she has a particularly large fin on her back,
which makes her easy to identify.
So, yes, they're all very different‚Ä¶
Well, they sound a fascinating group‚Ä¶

1144,Cam10 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam10---test-3---part-3,84,"Hi, Rob. How's the course going?
Oh, hi, Mia. Yeah, great.
I can't believe the first term's nearly over.
I saw your group's performance last night at the student theatre.
It was good.
Really?
Yeah‚Ä¶ but now we have to write a report on the whole thing, an in-depth analysis.
I don't know where to start.
Like, I have to write about the role I played, the doctor, how I developed the character.
Well, what was your starting point?
My grandfather was a doctor before he retired, and I just based it on him.
OK, but how?
Did you talk to him about it?
He must have all sorts of stories, but he never says much about his work, even now.
He has a sort of authority though.
So how did you manage to capture that?
I'd visualise what he must have been like in the past,
when he was sitting in his consulting room listening to his patients.
OK, so that's what you explain in your report.
Right.
Then there's the issue of atmosphere -
so in the first scene we needed to know how boring life was in the doctor's village in the 1950s,
so when the curtain went up on the first scene in the waiting room,
there was that long silence before anyone spoke.
And then people kept saying the same thing over and over, like 'Cold, isn't it?'
Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row.
Yes, all those details of the production.
And I have to analyse how I functioned in the group -
what I found out about myself.
I know I was so frustrated at times, when we couldn't agree.
Yes. So did one person emerge as the leader?
Sophia did.
That was OK - she helped us work out exactly what to do, for the production.
And that made me feel better, I suppose.
When you understood what needed doing?
Yes.
And Sophia did some research, too.
That was useful in developing our approach.
Like what?
Well, she found these articles from the 1950s about how relationships between children and their parents,
or between the public and people like bank managers or the police were shifting.
Interesting.
And did you have any practical problems to overcome?
Well, in the final rehearsal everything was going fine until the last scene -
that's where the doctor's first patient appears on stage on his own.
The one in the wheelchair?
Yes, and he had this really long speech, with the stage all dark except for one spotlight -
and then that stuck somehow so it was shining on the wrong side of the stage‚Ä¶
but anyway we got that fixed, thank goodness.
Yes, it was fine on the night.
But while you're here, Mia.
I wanted to ask you about the year abroad option.
Would you recommend doing that?
Yes, definitely.
It's a fantastic chance to study in another country for a year.
I think I'd like to do it,
but it looks very competitive -
there's only a limited number of places.
Yes, so next year when you are in the second year of the course,
you need to work really hard in all your theatre studies modules.
Only students with good marks get places -
you have to prove that you know your subject really well.
Right.
So how did you choose where to go?
Well, I decided I wanted a programme that would fit in with what I wanted to do after I graduate,
so I looked for a university with emphasis on acting rather than directing for example.
It depends on you.
Then about six months before you go,
you have to email the scheme coordinator with your top three choices.
I had a friend who missed the deadline and didn't get her first choice,
so you do need to get a move on at that stage.
You'll find that certain places are very popular with everyone.
And don't you have to write a personal statement at that stage?
Yes.
Right.
I'll get some of the final year students to give me some tips‚Ä¶
maybe see if I can read what they wrote.
I think that's a very good idea.
I don't mind showing you what I did.
And while you're abroad don't make the mistake I made.
I got so involved I forgot all about making arrangements for when I came back here for the final year.
Make sure you stay in touch so they know your choices for the optional modules.
You don't want to miss out doing your preferred specialisms.
Right.

1145,Cam10 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam10---test-3---part-4,61,"Today, I want to talk about self-regulatory focus theory
and how the actions of leaders can affect the way followers approach different situations.
Self-regulatory focus theory is a theory developed by Tori Higgins.
He says that a person's focus at any given time is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain.
These are two basic motivations that each and every one of us has,
and they cause us to have different kinds of goals.
Promotion goals in different life situations emphasise achievement.
Prevention goals are oriented towards the avoidance of punishment.
In a specific situation,
our thoughts might focus more on promotion goals or more on prevention goals.
The theory suggests that two factors affect which goals we are focusing on.
First, there is a chronic factor.
This factor is connected to a person's personality
and says that each person has a basic tendency to either focus more on promotion goals
or focus more on prevention goals as part of his or her personality.
Second, there is a situational factor
which means that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other.
For example, we are more likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have promotion goals
when we are spending time with a friend.
In contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss,
we are more likely to try to avoid making mistakes
and therefore have more prevention goals in our mind.
Research has shown that the goals we are focusing on at a given time affect the way we think.
For example, when focusing on promotion goals,
people consider their ideal self, their aspirations and gains.
They don't think about what they can lose,
so they think in a happier mode.
They feel more inspired to change.
When people are focusing on prevention goals,
they think about their ‚Äúought‚Äù self.
What are they supposed to be?
What are people expecting from them?
They consider their obligations to others.
As a result, they experience more anxiety and try to avoid situations where they could lose.
Now that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people,
I want to look at the idea that the way leaders behave, or their style of leading,
can affect the focus that followers adopt in a specific situation.
In talking about leadership,
we often mention transformational leaders and transactional leaders.
Transformational leaders, when interacting with their followers, focus on their development.
In their words and actions transformational leaders highlight change.
Their speech is passionate and conveys a definitive vision.
All of these things can encourage followers to think about what could be.
In other words, they inspire a promotion focus in their followers.
In contrast, transactional leaders focus on developing clear structures
that tell their followers exactly what is expected of them.
While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders,
they emphasise more how a follower will be punished
or that a follower won't get rewarded
if his or her behaviour doesn't change.
In short, they emphasise the consequences of making a mistake.
This emphasis will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and problems.
This is clearly a prevention focus.
In conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the other one.
For a designer who works in a field where a lot of innovation is needed,
a promotion focus is probably better.
In contrast, a prevention focus which causes people to work more cautiously and produce higher quality work
might be very appropriate for a job like a surgeon, for example.
The main point of the research, though, is that the actions of leaders
can greatly influence whether people approach a situation
with more of a promotion focus or more of a prevention focus.

Good morning. Is that Mr Thorndyke?
Speaking.
How can I help?
I've got quite a few things which need painting and fixing in the flat
and I wonder whether you'd be able to do the work.
I'm sure I'd be able to help but let me take down a few details.
Yes, of course.
Well, firstly, how did you hear about us?
It was my friend May Hampton‚Ä¶
you did some excellent work for her a couple of years ago.
Do you remember?
Oh, yes, that was in West Park Flats, lovely lady.
Yes, she is.
And what's your name, please?
It's Edith Pargetter.
can you spell your surname, please?
It's P-A-R-G-E-T-T-E-R.
Double T, right.
And do you live in West Park Flats as well?
No, actually it's East Park, Flat 4.
Oh, right, that's over the road, I seem to remember - quite difficult to get to.
Yes, it's at the back of the library.
Right, I know.
And what's your phone number?
875934
but I'm out a great deal in the afternoons and evenings.
So would the best time to ring you be in the morning?
Yes.
Fine. I've made a note of that.
Can I just ask, I'll be in a van and I know parking's rather difficult round your flats.
Where would you recommend?
Well, I always tell people in larger vehicles to park by the postbox on the other side of the road from the entrance.
Good, thanks.
And will you be able to give me a full itemised quote?
Oh, yes, I'll list all the jobs separately with individual prices.
That'd be a great help.
No problem.
Now, what would you like me to do?
Firstly and most urgently is in the kitchen.
With all the weather damage, the glass in the door has cracked and I'd need that fixing‚Ä¶
I presume you mean replacing?
Oh, yes. And as soon as possible‚Ä¶
What I'll do is come round tomorrow morning and do that immediately.
Oh, thank you so much.
The other things aren't so urgent but‚Ä¶
Now, I'll make a note of everything you want doing.
Well, in the kitchen I'd like some painting doing.
All the kitchen walls?
Just the area over the cooker.
It's very greasy‚Ä¶
Right‚Ä¶ it does tend to get that way!
Yes!
Well, if you want a proper job done what I'd need to do is strip the old paint and plaster it about a week before I paint it.
Of course.
Now, May tells me you also do work in the garden.
That's right.
Well, I'd like you to replace a fence.
Just one?
Yes, at the far end.
Fine. Shouldn't be a problem.
And that's the lot.
Fine.
Yeah, as I say I can come round tomorrow morning to look over things with you.
Oh, that's great, thank you.
So, I'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow at‚Ä¶

1147,Cam10 - Test 4 - Part 2,B2,cam10---test-4---part-2,52,"Welcome to Manham Port, where a thousand years of history are brought to life.
All the family can enjoy a day out at Manham:
visit our copper mine, see models of the machinery it used,
have your photo taken in nineteenth century costume,
experience at first hand how people lived at different stages throughout history,
and especially how children studied, worked and played.
The port of Manham is located in beautiful and peaceful countryside,
on a bend in the great River Avon,
and developed here because it's the highest navigable point of the Avon -
boats can go no higher up this river -
and proved a handy place to load and unload cargo to and from the sea,
which is over 23 miles away.
A small port was already established here when, about 900 years ago, tin was discovered nearby,
though it wasn't until the Industrial Revolution, when a tremendous need for metals of all kinds developed,
that Manham expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country.
And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals,
and by the end of the nineteenth century, lead, copper, manganese and arsenic were added to the cargos leaving Manham.
In the early days, the ores had been smelted - or processed - in the same area they were mined.
But, as demand grew, the smelting process required huge factory furnaces or fires to melt the metal from the rock
and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped long distances.
Sadly, in the twentieth century, the great port of Manham declined,
and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area.
The building at the port fell into disrepair,
and the place became almost forgotten.
But then, the Manham Trust was formed to conserve the historical resources of the area.
It organised scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations.
It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex
and to set about reconstructing it.
Today you can see the results of this ambitious programme of restoration.
The intention, and we believe this will be realised before the end of the year,
is to return Manham Port to the condition it reached at its peak as 'the greatest copper port in the country'.
But what can you do and see on your visit today?
Here are just a few highlights.
We suggest you start with the visit to the copper mine.
Travel on converted mining trains and journey into the depths of the mountain along seams once worked by hundreds of miners.
Watch out especially for the great pumping machines which rid the mine of water.
But please be warned that, like all mines, ours is very dark and closed in
and we do say that children under five and also dogs should NOT be taken into the mine.
The next recommended visit is to the village school.
While looking round the classrooms, take a special look at our display of games, which is one of the largest in the world.
And it's recommended that you time your visit to coincide with a guided tour.
This will give you the opportunity to ask lots of questions.
Near the school is the beautiful old sailing ketch called 'The George'.
You are welcome to board the boat and look round the cabins.
Look out for the ship's wheel which was missing until only five years ago
when it was dredged out of the silt by a local fisherman.
We have no idea how it got there
but it's been polished and proudly restored to its original place on the boat.
Please take care going down the ladders if you wish to visit the lower deck -
we don't recommend you allow young children to use them.
So we hope you have a memorable visit to Manham Port
and will tell your friends all about us.

1148,Cam10 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam10---test-4---part-3,88,"Hi, Laura - could you spare a few minutes to talk about the work placement you did last summer?
I'm thinking of doing one myself‚Ä¶
Hi, Tim. Sure.
Didn't you do yours at an environmental services company?
That's right‚Ä¶
It's only a very small company
and they needed someone to produce a company brochure,
and I wanted to get some business experience
because I'm interested in a career in occupational psychology in a business environment.
It was good because I had overall responsibility for the project.
What kind of skills do you think you developed on the placement?
I mean, apart from the ones you already had‚Ä¶
Did you have to do all the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything?
We hired the services of a professional photographer for that.
I did have to use my IT skills to a certain extent
because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets,
but that didn't involve anything I hadn't done before.
Do you think you got any better at managing your time and prioritizing things?
You always used to say you had trouble with that‚Ä¶
Oh, definitely.
There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline.
And I also got better at explaining things and asserting my opinions,
because I had to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and give him a progress report.
It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then.
Absolutely.
It was really worthwhile‚Ä¶
But you know, the company benefited too‚Ä¶
Yes, they must have done.
After all, if they'd used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure instead of doing it in-house,
presumably they'd have paid a lot more?
Oh, yes.
I worked it out -
it would have been 250% more.
And I thought the end result was good,
even though we did everything on site.
The company has quite a powerful computer
and I managed to borrow some scanning software from the university.
The new brochure looks really professional;
it enhances the image of the company straight away.
So in the long run it should help them to attract clients, and improve their sales figures?
That's the idea. Yeah.
Well, all in all it sounds very positive -
I think I will go ahead and apply for a placement myself.
How do I go about it?
It's easy enough to do,
because there's a government agency called STEP
- S-T-E-P
- that organises placements for students.
You should start by getting their booklet with all the details -
I expect you can download one from their website.
Actually, they've got copies in the psychology department -
I've seen them there.
I'll just go to the office and pick one up.
Right.
And then if I were you, after I'd looked at it I'd go over all the options with someone‚Ä¶
I suppose I should ask my tutor's advice.
He knows more about me than anyone.
One of the career officers would be better,
they've got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.
OK‚Ä¶
And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP -
you'll find their address in the booklet.
And once you've registered they assign you to a mentor who looks after your application.
And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something?
They told me at the careers office that it's best to be proactive, and get updates yourself
by checking the website for new placement alerts.
Your mentor is supposed to keep you informed, but you can't rely on that.
I don't suppose it's a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is it?
Not really‚Ä¶
But it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview.
You get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel departments.
And do I reply directly to them?
Yes, you do.
STEP only gets involved again once you've been made a job offer.
Right‚Ä¶
So, once you've had an interview you should let your mentor know what the outcome is?
I mean whether you're offered a job, and whether you've decided to accept it?
That's right.
They'll inform the careers office once a placement has been agreed,
so you don't have to do that.
Is that all then?
More or less.
Only once you've accepted an offer you'll probably have to supply a reference,
because the placement will be conditional on that.
And that's something you should ask your own tutor to provide.
He knows about your academic ability and also about your qualities, like reliability.
Well, thanks very much for the information -
I'm starting to look‚Ä¶

1149,Cam10 - Test 4 - Part 4,C1,cam10---test-4---part-4,58,"Today we're going to look at an important area of science, namely nanotechnology.
So what is it?
Nano means tiny,
so it's science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules.
The idea is that by controlling and rearranging atoms, you can literally create anything.
However, as we'll see, the science of the small has some big implications affecting us in many ways.
There's no doubt that nanotechnology promises so much for civilisation.
However, all new technologies have their teething problems.
And with nanotechnology, society often gets the wrong idea about its capabilities.
Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people's fears about nanotechnology -
with scenarios such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it,
or self-replicating nano-robots that eventually take over the world.
So how do we safeguard such a potentially powerful technology?
Some scientists recommend that nano-particles be treated as new chemicals with separate safety tests and clear labelling.
They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in laboratories and factories.
Others have called for a withdrawal of new nano products such as cosmetics
and a temporary halt to many kinds of nanotech research.
But as far as I'm concerned there's a need to plough ahead with the discoveries and applications of nanotechnology.
I really believe that most scientists would welcome a way to guard against unethical uses of such technology.
We can't go around thinking that all innovation is bad, all advancement is bad.
As with the debate about any new technology, it is how you use it that's important.
So let's look at some of its possible uses.
Thanks to nanotechnology, there could be a major breakthrough in the field of transportation
with the production of more durable metals.
These could be virtually unbreakable, lighter and much more pliable
leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present.
Those same improved capabilities will dramatically reduce the cost of travelling into space
making it more accessible to ordinary people and opening up a totally new holiday destination.
In terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to shrink computer parts down to minute sizes.
We need nanotechnology in order to create a new generation of computers
that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory
but will be about the size of a sugar cube.
Nanotechnology could also revolutionise the way that we generate power.
The cost of solar cells will be drastically reduced
so harnessing this energy will be far more economical than at present.
But nanotechnology has much wider applications than this
and could have an enormous impact on our environment.
For instance, tiny airborne nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the ozone layer,
which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet.
That's a pretty amazing thought, isn't it?
On a more local scale,
this new technology could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters
as nanotechnology will allow us to remove oil and other contaminants from the water far more effectively.
And, if nanotechnology progresses as expected -
as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms -
then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up.
In terms of production, this means that you only use what you need
and so there wouldn't be any waste.
The notion that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health.
It means that we'll eventually be able to replicate anything.
This would have a phenomenal effect on our society.
In time it could even lead to the eradication of famine
through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry.
But it's in the area of medicine that nanotechnology may have its biggest impact.
How we detect disease will change as tiny biosensors are developed to analyse tests in minutes rather than days.
There's even speculation nano-robots could be used to slow the ageing process, lengthening life expectancy.
As you can see, I'm very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next few decades.
Just how long it'll take, I honestly don't know.

Good evening.
I'm ringing about the job I understand you have vacant.
Oh yes.
I'd like to find out a few more details, if i may.
Yes, of course. Can i take your name?
It's Peter Chin.
Okay Peter.
Well, if you want to ask about the job and then if we're both still interested,
we could arrange for you to come for an interview.
Great, thanks.
I'm afraid i missed the advert for the job but heard about it from a friend.
That's no problem at all.
What would you like to know?
Well, um, what sort of work is it? Washing up?
It's answering the phone.
Oh, right, fine.
And not waiting at table.
That'd be good.
And how many nights a week would it be?
Well, we're really only busy at the weekend.
So two nights?
Three actually, so it would work out at twelve hours a week.
That'd be fine.
It wouldn't interfere with my studies.
Are you at the university?
Yes. First year Physics student.
Oh right.
Um, and because I'm not an EU national, would I need a work permit?
Yes you would.
Just get your tutor to sign it.
That wouldn't be a problem, if i were to get the job.
Um, where exactly is the restaurant?
Well, we have two branches -
the one we're recruiting for is in Hillsdunne Road.
I don't know that.
How do you spell it please?
It's HILLSDUNNE Road.
Got that. Thanks.
is it near a bus stop?
Yes. The nearest one would probably be just beside the library.
Oh yes, I know it. That'd be fine for me.
And could I ask about the pay?
We're offering ¬£4.45 an hour.
That's very good.
My last job was ¬£3.95 an hour.
We feel it's pretty good and we also offer some good fringe benefits.
Really?
Well, we give you a free dinner, so you eat well.
Right, better than hostel food!
We certainly hope so!
And we also offer extra pay for working on national holidays.
Oh, that's a really good perk, isn't it?
Yes, we think so.
And then because of the difficulties of getting public transport,
if you're working after 11 o'clock we drive you home.
Oh, that's good to know.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in inviting you for an interview, if you're still interested?
Oh yes, certainly.
Could I just also ask what qualities you're looking for?
Well, for this particular job we want a clear voice, which you obviously do have!
Thanks.
And you must be able to think quickly, you know.
Well, I hope I'd...
So, when could you come in for an interview?
We're actually quite quiet tonight?
Sorry, I couldn't come tonight...
or tomorrow, I'm afraid.
Thursday's okay, that'd be 22nd of October.
Fine, after 5 p.m?
Yes, fine. Would 6 o'clock be okay?
Perfect.
And could you bring along the names of two referees?
Yes, that's fine, no problem.
Good, I look forward to seeing you.
Oh, by the way, who should i ask for?
Oh yes, of course, sorry.

1151,Cam9 - Test 1 - Part 2,B2,cam9---test-1---part-2,49,"Now we go to Jane who is going to tell us about what's happening in town this weekend.
Right, thanks Andrew,
and now on to what's new,
and do we really need yet another sports shop in Bradcaster?
Well, most of you probably know Sports World -
the branch of a Danish sports goods company that opened a few years ago -
it's attracted a lot of custom,
and so the company has now decided to open another branch in the area.
It's going to be in the shopping centre to the west of Bradcaster.
So that will be good news for all of you who found the original shop in the north of the town hard to get to.
I was invited to a special preview
and I can promise you, this is the ultimate in sports retailing.
The whole place has been given a new minimalist look
with the company's signature colours of black and red.
The first three floors have a huge range of sports clothing as well as equipment,
and on the top floor, there's a cafe and a book and DVD section.
You'll find all the well-known names as well as some less well-known ones.
If they haven't got exactly what you want in stock,
they promise to get it for you in ten days.
Unlike the other store, where it can take up to fourteen days.
They cover all the major sports, including football, tennis and swimming,
but they particularly focus on running.
and they claim to have the widest range of equipment in the country.
As well as that, a whole section of the third floor is devoted to sports bags,
including the latest designs from the States.
If you can't find what you want here, it doesn't exist!
The shop will be open from 9.00 am this Saturday
and if you go along to the opening
then you'll have the chance to meet the national 400 metres running champion - Paul King,
who's coming along to open the shop,
and he will be staying around until about midday
to chat to any fans who want to meet him and sign autographs.
Then there will be a whole range of special attractions all weekend.
There will be free tickets for local sporting events for the first 50 customers,
and also a special competition open to all.
Just answer fifteen out of twenty sports questions correctly
to win a signed copy of Paul King's DVD - 'Spring Tips',
while the first person to get all the questions correct gets a year's free membership of the Bradcaster Gym.
All entrants will receive a special Sports calendar
with details of all Bradcaster fixtures in the coming year.
One of the special opening offers is a fitness test -
a complete review of your cardiac fitness and muscle tone,
actually done in the shop by qualified staff.
This would normally cost ¬£30
but is available at half price for this month only.
There are only a limited number of places available for this,
so to make a booking, phone 560341.
In addition, if you open an account you get lots more special offers
including the chance to try out equipment...

1152,Cam9 - Test 1 - Part 3,C1,cam9---test-1---part-3,89,"Before we start, Spiros and Hiroko,
thanks for coming in today to talk about your recent study experiences
and congratulations to you both in doing so well in your first semester exams!
I'd like to discuss with you the value of the English for Academic Purposes course you did here last year
before starting your university course.
Spiros, if I could start with you,
what parts of the programme have now proved to be particularly valuable to you?
Um... I think that having to do a seminar presentation really helped me.
For example, a couple of weeks ago in our marketing subject,
when it was my turn to give a presentation I felt quite confident.
Of course, I was still nervous but...
because I had done one before, I knew what to expect.
Also, I know I was well-prepared and I had practised my timing.
In fact, I think that in relation to some of the other people in my group,
I did quite a good job because my overall style was quite professional.
What about you, Hiroko?
Mmm, that's interesting.
In my group, I was really surprised by the way the students did their presentations -
they just read their notes aloud!
Can you believe that?
They didn't worry about their presentation style or keeping eye contact with their audience
and I remember that these things were really stressed to us in the course here.
So, how did you approach your presentation, Hiroko?
Well, to speak frankly, I read my notes too!
At the time, it was a relief to do it this way, but...
actually, when I had finished, I didn't feel any real sense of satisfaction.
I didn't feel positive about the experience at all.
That's a pity.
You know, although I was pleased with my presentation,
I am not so pleased with my actual performance right now in the tutorials -
during the whole semester, I've not said anything in our tutorial discussions.
Not a word.
Really, Spiros?
Why's that?
Do the other students talk too much?
It's partly that,
but it's mostly because I have had no confidence to speak out.
Their style of speaking is so different.
It's not the style we were used to during the course.
They use so many colloquialisms,
they're not very polite and sometimes there seems to be no order in their discussion.
Also, they are very familiar with each other,
so because they know each other's habits,
they can let each other into the discussion.
You're right, Spiros, I've experienced that too.
For most of this semester, I've said absolutely nothing in tutorials.
But recently, I've been trying to speak up more and I just jump in,
and I've noticed an interesting thing.
I've noticed that if they thought my point was interesting or new,
then the next time they actually asked for my opinion,
and then it was much easier for me to be part of the discussion.
That's great, Hiroko!
I hope that happens for me next semester.
I'll have to work hard to find some interesting points.
What helped you to find these ideas?
I think that one thing that helped me with this was the reading.
I've had to do so much reading this semester just to help me make sense of the lectures.
At first, I couldn't understand what the lecturers were talking about,
so I had to turn to the books and journals.
Every night I read for hours,
using the lists of references that were given, and I made pages of notes.
At breakfast, I read and read my notes again.
This habit has helped me to follow the ideas in the lectures,
and it's also given me some ideas to use in the tutorials.
But i did so much reading anyway.
I don't think there's any time left over for anything extra.
My reading speed is still quite slow,
though I'm much better at dealing with vocabulary than I used to be.
What else do you think we could add to the course program to help with this reading problem?
There's not really anything because it's my problem.
I remember we were given long articles to read.
We didn't like that but now I realise that reading those long articles was good preparation for the things I need to read now.
Also, in class, we regularly had speed-reading tasks to do,
and we kept a record of our reading speed,
so the teachers were encouraging us to work on that.
That's true, Spiros,
but what we read could have been different.
Sometimes in the English class, I felt frustrated when I had to read articles about the environment or health or education,
because I wanted to concentrate on my own field,
but we didn't read anything about engineering.
So, I think I wasted some time learning vocabulary I didn't need.
Hmm... but surely the strategies you were taught for dealing with that vocabulary were helpful.
Yes, but psychologically speaking,
I would have felt much better working on reading from my own field.
What do you think Spiros?
Oh, I agree, that would have helped my confidence too
and I would have been more motivated.
It was good though that we could work on our own topics when we wrote the research assignments.
Okay, let's move on to writing now...

1153,Cam9 - Test 1 - Part 4,C1,cam9---test-1---part-4,54,"Good afternoon everyone.
Well, with some of you about to go out on field work
it's timely that in this afternoon's session I'll be sharing some ideas about the reasons why groups of whales and dolphins
sometimes swim ashore from the sea right onto the beach and...
most often, die in what are known as 'mass strandings'.
Unfortunately, this type of event is a frequent occurrence in some of the locations that you'll be travelling to,
where sometimes the tide goes out suddenly, confusing the animals.
However, there are many other theories about the causes of mass strandings.
The first is that the behaviour is linked to parasites.
It's often found that stranded animals were infested with large numbers of parasites.
For instance, a type of worm is commonly found in the ears of dead whales.
Since marine animals rely heavily on their hearing to navigate,
this type of infestation has the potential to be very harmful.
Another theory is related to toxins, or poisons.
These have also been found to contribute to the death of many marine animals.
Many toxins, as I'm sure you're aware, originate from plants, or animals.
The whale ingests these toxins in its normal feeding behaviour
but whether these poisons directly or indirectly lead to stranding and death
seems to depend upon the toxin involved.
In 1988, for example,
14 humpback whales examined after stranding along the beaches of Cape Cod
were found to have been poisoned after eating tuna that contained saxitoxin,
the same toxin that can be fatal in humans.
Alternatively, it has also been suggested that some animals strand accidentally by following their prey ashore in the confusion of the chase.
In 1995, David Thurston monitored pilot whales that beached after following squid ashore.
However, this idea does not seem to hold true for the majority of mass strandings
because examination of the animals' stomach contents reveal that most had not been feeding as they stranded.
There are also some new theories which link strandings to humans.
A growing concern is that loud noises in the ocean cause strandings.
Noises such as those caused by military exercises are of particular concern
and have been pinpointed as the cause of some strandings of late.
One of these, a mass stranding of whales in 2000 in the Bahamas
coincided closely with experiments using a new submarine detection system.
There were several factors that made this stranding stand out as different from previous strandings.
This led researchers to look for a new cause.
For one, all the stranded animals were healthy.
In addition, the animals were spread out along 38 kilometres of coast,
whereas it's more common for the animals to be found in a group when mass strandings occur.
A final theory is related to group behaviour,
and suggests that sea mammals cannot distinguish between sick and healthy leaders
and will follow sick leaders, even to an inevitable death.
This is a particularly interesting theory
since the whales that are thought to be most social - the toothed whales -
are the group that strand the most frequently.
The theory is also supported by evidence from a dolphin stranding in 1994.
Examination of the dead animals revealed that apart from the leader,
all the others had been healthy at the time of their death.
Without one consistent theory however,
it is very hard for us to do anything about this phenomenon
except to assist animals where and when we can.
Stranding networks have been established around the world
to aid in rescuing animals and collecting samples from those that could not be helped.
I recommend John Connor's Marine Mammals Ashore as an excellent starting point
if you're interested in finding out more about these networks, or establishing one yourself.

1154,Cam9 - Test 2 - Part 1,B1,cam9---test-2---part-1,69,"Good morning. Can I help you?
Yes. I've just been accepted on a course at the university
and I'd like to try and arrange accommodation in the hall of residence.
Yes, certainly.
Please sit down.
What I'll do is fill in a form with you to find out a little more about your preferences and so forth.
Thank you.
So, first of all, can I take your name?
It's Anu Bhatt.
Could you spell your name please?
Yes.
ANU... BHATT.
Thanks, and could I ask your date of birth?
The 31st March, 1972.
Thank you.
And where are you from?
India.
Oh right.
And um... what will you be studying?
I'm doing a course in nursing.
Right, thank you.
And how long would you want to stay in hall, do you think?
Well, it'll take three years
but I'd only like to stay in hall for two.
I'd like to think about living outside for the third year.
Fine.
And what did you have in mind for catering?
Do you want to cook for yourself or have all your meals provided, that's full board?
Is there something in between?
Yes. You can just have evening meal provided, which is half board.
That's what I'd prefer.
Yes, a lot of students opt for that.
Now, with that in mind, do you have any special diet, anything we should know about?
Yes, I don't take red meat.
No red meat.
Now, thinking about the room itself, we have a number of options.
You can have a single study bedroom or you can have a shared one.
These are both what we call simple rooms.
The other alternative is to opt for a single bedsit
which actually has more space and better facilities.
There's about ¬£20 a week difference between them.
Well, actually my grant is quite generous and I think the bedsit sounds the best option.
Lovely.
I'll put you down for that and we'll see what availability is like.
Now can I ask some other personal details which we like to have on record?
Yes, of course.
I wonder if you could let us know what your interests are.
This might help us get a closer match for placing you in a particular hall.
Well. I love the theatre.
Right.
And I enjoy sports, particularly badminton.
Ah, that's worth knowing.
Now, what we finish with on the form is really a list from you of what your priorities are in choosing a hall
and we'll do our best to take these into account.
Well, the first thing is I'd prefer a hall where there are other mature students, if possible.
Yes, we do have halls which tend to cater for slightly older students.
Ummm and I'd prefer to be out of town.
That's actually very good for you because we tend to have more vacancies in out-of-town halls.
Lucky!
Yes.
Anything else?
Well, I would like somewhere with a shared area, a TV room for example, or something like that.
It's a good way to socialise.
Certainly is.
That's it.
Now, we just need a contact telephone number for you.
Sure, I'll just find it.
It's 667549.
Great, so we'll be in contact with you as soon as possible...

1155,Cam9 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam9---test-2---part-2,53,"Hello,
I'm delighted to welcome you to our Wildlife Club,
and very pleased that you're interested in the countryside
and the plants and creatures of this area.
I think you'll be surprised at the variety we have here,
even though we're not far from London.
I'll start by telling you about some of the parks and open spaces nearby.
One very pleasant place is Halland Common.
This has been public land for hundreds of years,
and what you'll find interesting is that the River Ouse, which flows into the sea eighty kilometres away,
has its source in the common.
There's an information board about the plants and animals you can see here,
and by the way, the common is accessible 24 hours a day.
Then there's Holt Island, which is noted for its great range of trees.
In the past willows were grown here commercially for basket-making,
and this ancient craft has recently been reintroduced.
The island is only open to the public from Friday to Sunday,
because it's quite small,
and if there were people around every day, much of the wildlife would keep away.
From there it's just a short walk across the bridge to Longfield Country Park.
Longfield has a modern replica of a farm from over two thousand years ago.
Children's activities are often arranged there, like bread-making and face-painting.
The park is only open during daylight hours, so bear that in mind if you decide to go there.
Longfield Park has a programme of activities throughout the year,
and to give you a sample, this is what's happening in the next few days.
On Monday you can learn about herbs, and how they've been used over the centuries.
You'll start with a tour of our herb garden,
practise the technique of using them as colour dyes for cloth,
and listen to an illustrated talk about their use in cooking and medicine.
Then on Wednesday you can join local experts to discover the variety of insects and birds that appear in the evening.
We keep to a small number of people in the group,
so if you want to go, you'll need to phone the park ranger a few days ahead.
There's a small charge, which you should pay when you turn up.
I'm sure you're all keen to help with the practical task of looking after the park,
so on Saturday you can join a working party.
You'll have a choice of all sorts of activities, from planting hedges to picking up litter,
so you'll be able to change from one to another when you feel like it.
The rangers will be hard at work all day,
but do come and join in, even for just a short while.
One thing, though, is to make sure you're wearing something that you don't mind getting dirty or torn.
And finally I'd like to tell you about our new wildlife area, Hinchingbrooke Park,
which will be opened to the public next month.
This slide doesn't really indicate how big it is,
but anyway, you can see the two gates into the park, and the main paths.
As you can see, there's a lake in the north west of the park,
with a bird hide to the west of it, at the end of a path.
So it'll be a nice quiet place for watching the birds on the lake.
Fairly close to where refreshments are available,
there's a dog-walking area in the southern part of the park, leading off from the path.
And if you just want to sit and relax, you can go to the flower garden;
that's the circular area on the map surrounded by paths.
And finally, there's a wooded area in the western section of the park, between two paths.
Okay, that's enough from me, so let's...

1156,Cam9 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam9---test-2---part-3,75,"Hi Jun.
As you know, I've asked you here today to discuss the future of our Self-Access Centre.
We have to decide what we want to do about this very important resource for our English language students.
So, can you tell me what the students think about this?
Well, from the students' point of view, we would like to keep it.
The majority of students say that they enjoy using it
because it provides a variation on the classroom routine
and they see it as a pretty major component of their course,
but we would like to see some improvements to the equipment, particularly the computers;
there aren't enough for one each at the moment and we always have to share.
Well, yes, the teachers agree that it is a very valuable resource
but one thing we have noticed is that a lot of the students are using it to check their personal emails.
We don't want to stop you students using it,
but we think the computers should be used as a learning resource, not for emails.
Some of us also think that we could benefit a lot more by relocating the Self-Access Centre
to the main University library building.
How do you think the students would feel about that, Jun?
Well, the library is big enough to incorporate the Self-Access Centre,
but it wouldn't be like a class activity anymore.
Our main worry would be not being able to go to a teacher for advice.
I'm sure there would be plenty of things to do
but we really need teachers to help us choose the best activities.
Well, there would still be a teacher present and he or she would guide the activities of the students,
we wouldn't just leave them to get on with it.
Yes, but I think the students would be much happier keeping the existing set-up;
they really like going to the Self-Access Centre with their teacher
and staying together as a group to do activities.
If we could just improve the resources and facilities, I think it would be fine.
Is the cost going to be a problem?
It's not so much the expense that I'm worried about,
and we've certainly got room to do it,
but it's the problem of timetabling a teacher to be in there outside class hours.
If we're going to spend a lot of money on equipment and resources,
we really need to make sure that everything is looked after properly.
Anyway, let's make some notes to see just what needs doing to improve the Centre.
Now, what about the computers?
I think it might be a good idea to install some new models.
They would take up a lot less room
and so that would increase the work space for text books and so on.
That would be great.
It is a bit cramped in there at times.
What about other resources?
Do you have a list of things that the students would like to see improved?
Yes, one of the comments that students frequently make
is that they find it difficult to find materials that are appropriate for their level,
especially reading resources,
so I think we need to label them more clearly.
Well, that's easy enough, we can get that organised very quickly.
In fact, I think we should review all of the study resources as some of them are looking a bit out-of-date.
Definitely.
The CD section especially needs to be more current.
I think we should get some of the ones that go with our latest course books
and also make multiple copies.
Good.
Now, I was also thinking about some different materials that we haven't got in there at all.
What do you think of the idea of introducing some workbooks?
If we break them up into separate pages and laminate them,
they'd be a great resource.
The students could study the main course book in class
and then do follow-up practice in the Self-Access Centre.
That sounds good.
Okay, now, finally we need to think about how the room is used.
I'll have to talk to the teachers
and make sure we can all reach some agreement on a timetable to supervise the centre after class.
But we also need to think about security, too.
Especially if we're going to invest in some new equipment.
Umm... what about putting in an alarm?
Good idea.
The other thing I'd like to do is talk to our technicians
and see whether we could somehow limit the access to email.
I really don't want to see that resource misused.
What about if we agree to only use it before and after class?
Yes, that would be fine.

1157,Cam9 - Test 2 - Part 4,C1,cam9---test-2---part-4,52,"Good morning everyone.
Now whether you're going to university to study business or some other subject,
many of you will eventually end up working for a company of some kind.
Now, when you first start working somewhere you will realise that the organisation you've joined has certain characteristics.
And we often refer to these social characteristics as the culture of the organisation.
This includes its unwritten ideas, beliefs, values and things like that.
One well known writer has classified company cultures by identifying four major types.
The first type is called the Power Culture,
and it's usually found in small organisations.
It's the type of culture that needs a central source of power to be effective,
and because control is in the hands of just one or two people,
there aren't many rules or procedures.
Another characteristic is that communication usually takes the form of conversations
rather than, say, formal meetings or written memos.
Now one of the benefits of this culture is that the organisation has the ability to act quickly,
so it responds well to threat, or danger on the one hand, and opportunity on the other.
But on the negative side, this type of organisation doesn't always act effectively,
because it depends too much on one or two people at the top,
and when these people make poor decisions, there's no-one else who can influence them.
And the kind of person who does well in this type of business culture is one who is happy to take risks,
and for whom job security is a low priority.
The next type is known as Role Culture -
that's ROLE, not ROLL, by the way,
and this type is usually found in large companies,
which have lots of different levels in them.
These organisations usually have separate departments
that specialise in things like finance, or sales, or maintenance, or whatever.
Each one is co-ordinated at the top by a small group of senior managers,
and typically everyone's job is controlled by sets of rules and procedures.
For example, there are specific job descriptions, rules for discipline, and so on.
What are the benefits of this kind of culture?
Well firstly, because it's found in large organisations,
its fixed costs, or overheads as they're known, are low in relation to its output, or what it produces.
In other words it can achieve economies of scale.
And secondly, it is particularly successful in business markets where technical expertise is important.
On the other hand, this culture is often very slow to recognise the need for change,
and even slower to react.
What kind of person does this type of culture suit?
Well, it suits employees who value security,
and who don't particularly want to have responsibility.
Moving on now to Task Cultures.
This type is found in organisations that are project-oriented.
You usually find it where the market for the company's product is extremely competitive,
or where the products themselves have a short life-span.
Usually top management delegates the projects, the people and other resources.
And once these have been allocated, little day-to-day control is exercised from the top,
because this would seem like breaking the rules'.
Now one of the major benefits of this culture is that it's flexible.
But it does have some major disadvantages too.
For instance, it can't produce economies of scale or great depth of expertise.
People who like working in groups or teams prefer this type of culture.
And finally, the fourth category is called the Person Culture...

1158,Cam9 - Test 3 - Part 1,B2,cam9---test-3---part-1,10,"Greek Island Holidays, can I help you?
Yes, I hope so.
I have a friend who's just come back from Corfu
and she's recommended some apartments in Arilas.
She thought they might be on your list.
Arilas, Arilas... let me see.
Can you give me the names?
Yes, the first's Rose Garden Apartments.
I'd like to go with another friend in the last week of October.
Well, we've got a lovely studio flat available at that time.
I'm sure you'd enjoy the entertainment programme there too,
with Greek dancing in the restaurant.
And the cost for each of us?
¬£219.
That sounds very reasonable!
I'm just jotting down some notes.
Now the second one she mentioned was called Blue Bay.
Blue Bay?
Yes, in fact that's very popular and it has some special features.
Really?
The main attraction is the large swimming pool with salt water.
Much healthier, I understand.
That's right.
And it isn't far from the beach, either - only 300 metres,
and only around half a kilometre to some shops,
so you don't have to be too energetic.
Is it much more expensive than the first one?
Let me just check.
I think at the time you want to go it's around ¬£260
No, ¬£275 to be exact.
Right, I've got that.
Now there are just two more apartments to ask you about.
Um, I can't read my own writing!
Something to do with sun... Sunshine, is it?
I think you meant the Sunshade Apartments.
They're on a mountainside.
Any special features?
Yes, each room has its own sun terrace
and there are shared barbecue facilities.
Oh, sounds lovely!
Yes, it is rather well-equipped.
It also provides water sports, it has its own beach.
There are facilities for water-skiing.
Any kite-surfing? My friend's quite keen.
Not at the hotel but I'm sure you'll find some in Arilas.
There's also satellite TV in the apartments.
And how much is that one?
¬£490 with two sharing.
You mean ¬£245 each?
I'm afraid not!
Each person has to pay that amount and there must be at least two in an apartment.
I don't think that would be within our budget, unfortunately.
And the last one sounds a bit expensive too - the Grand!
Actually it's quite reasonable.
It's an older style house with Greek paintings in every room, and a balcony outside.
Sounds nice. What are the views like?
Well, there are forests all round and they hide a supermarket just down the road,
so that's very useful for all your shopping needs.
There's a disco in the area too.
And the price?
¬£319 at that time,
but if you leave it till November it goes down by 40%.
Hmm... Too late, I'm afraid.
Well, why don't i send you a brochure with full details, Ms...?
Nash.
But don't worry about that.
I'm coming to Upminster soon and I'll call and get one.
I just wanted to get an idea first.
Well, that's fine.
Uhh... We've got plenty here when you come.
If you've got a minute, could I just check a couple of points about insurance?
I got one policy through the post but I'd like to see if yours is better.
Fine.
What would you like to know?
Well, the one I've got has benefits and then the maximum amount you can claim.
Is that like yours?
Yes, that's how most of them are.
Well, the first thing is cancellation.
If the holiday's cancelled on the policy I've got, you can claim ¬£8,000.
We can improve on that, Ms Nash.
For Greek Island holidays, our maximum is ¬£10,000.
That's good - of course our holiday won't even cost ¬£1,000 together!
It's still sensible to have good cover.
Now, if you go to hospital, we allow ¬£600.
Yes, mine's similar.
And we also allow a relative to travel to your holiday resort.
My policy just says their representative will help you.
You can see there's another difference there.
And what happens if you don't get on the plane?
Nothing, as far as I can see on this form.
Don't you have missed departure?
No, I'll just jot that down.
We pay up to ¬£1,000 for that, depending on the reason.
And we're particularly generous about loss of personal belongings -
up to ¬£3,000, but not more than ¬£500 for a single item.
Then I'd better not take my laptop!
Not unless you insure it separately.
Okay, thanks very much for your time, you've really been helpful.
Can I get back to you? Your name is?
Ben Ludlow.
That's LUDLOW.
I'm the Assistant Manager here.
I'll give you my number.
It's 081260543216.
But didn't I phone 081260567294?
That's what I've got on the paper.
That's the main switchboard.
I've given you my direct line.
Right, thank you very much for your time.

1159,Cam9 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam9---test-3---part-2,55,"For the second in our series about locally-run businesses, we meet Simon Winridge,
co-founder of the hugely-successful Winridge Forest Railway Park.
Welcome, Simon.
Now, perhaps you can begin by telling us a little bit about how it all started.
Well, during the 1970s, my wife, Liz and I had just acquired 80 acres of sheep-farming land,
and we decided to settle down and have children.
Pretty soon we had a daughter, Sarah, and a son, Duncan.
The place was wonderful for the kids:
they particularly loved trains and gradually built up an enormous network of miniature railway track.
I began to develop larger-scale models of locomotives
but we didn't think anything more of it until I went on a trip to a theme park near Birmingham
and decided we could do a much better job!
So we set up a small one ourselves based on the miniature railway
and we opened to the public for just a month that year, 1984 -
in July - our driest month -
because our children said they didn't want our guests to have a miserable, wet visit.
I dealt with park business and Liz carried on with the farm work.
It soon became clear that we were onto a winner.
We began to extend the railway track and lay it among more interesting landscape by planting trees,
which in turn attracted more wildlife,
and by making cuttings through the rock.
Nowadays, we're open all year round
and we're pleased to say that Winridge is one of the most popular visitor attractions in the area -
with 50,000 visitors a year -
a million and a half people have been through our doors since we opened.
All these visitors mean we have had to expand our operation
and it's now a truly family concern.
I'm near to retirement age so...
I only concern myself with looking after the mechanical side of things - keeping the trains going.
Liz now devotes all her energies to recruiting and supporting the large squadron of workers,
which keep the place running smoothly.
We're really pleased that after some years away teaching,
Sarah has now returned to the park and makes sure the visitors are kept fed and watered,
which keeps her pretty busy as you can imagine.
Our son, Duncan, has been a stalwart of the park for the last ten years,
taking over from me in the area of construction -
and I'll say a little bit more about that in a moment -
and his new wife - Judith, has also joined the team in charge of retail.
That's becoming a tremendous growth area for us -
a lot of people want to buy souvenirs.
So have you finished your development of the site for the moment?
Not at all!
We're constantly looking for ways to offer more to our visitors.
The railway remains the central feature
and there's now 1.2 kilometres of the line laid but we'd like to lay more.
Because of the geology of the area, our greatest problem is digging tunnels.
But we're gradually overcoming that.
We're also very pleased with a new installation of the Go-Kart arena
which is 120 square metres in area.
Again the problem is the geology;
we had to level the mounds on the track for safety reasons.
We wanted to enable 5 to 12 year olds to use the go-karts.
And the main attraction here is the Formula 1 Kart.
We've known fights to break out over who gets it!
And then, finally, to our most recent...

1160,Cam9 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam9---test-3---part-3,72,"Ah Caroline... come on in. Sit down.
Thanks.
So how's the dissertation planning going?
Well Dr Schulmann, I'm still having a lot of trouble deciding on a title.
Well, that's perfectly normal at this stage.
And this is what your tutorials will help you to do.
Right.
What we'll do is jot down some points that might help you in your decision.
First of all, you have chosen your general topic area, haven't you?
Yes, it's the fishing industry.
Oh yes, that was one of the areas you mentioned.
Now, what aspects of the course are you good at?
Well, I think I'm coping well with statistics,
and I'm never bored by it.
Good. Anything else?
Well, I found computer modelling fascinating -
I have no problem following what's being taught,
whereas quite a few of my classmates find it difficult.
Well, that's very good.
Do you think these might be areas you could bring into your dissertation?
Oh yes, if possible.
It's just that I'm having difficulty thinking how I can do that.
You see, I feel I don't have sufficient background information.
I see.
Well, do you take notes?
I'm very weak at note-taking.
My teachers always used to say that.
Well, I think you really need to work on these weaknesses before you go any further.
What do you suggest?
Well, I can go through the possible strategies with you and let you decide where to go from there.
Okay, thanks.
Well, some people find it helpful to organise peer-group discussions -
you know, each week a different person studies a different topic and shares it with the group.
Oh right.
It really helps build confidence, you know, having to present something to others.
I can see that.
The drawback is that everyone in the group seems to share the same ideas...
they keep being repeated in all the dissertations.
Okay.
You could also try a service called 'Student Support'.
It's designed to give you a structured programme over a number of weeks to develop your skills.
Sounds good.
Yes, unfortunately there are only a few places.
But it's worth looking into.
Yes, of course.
I know I've got to work on my study skills.
And then there are several study skills books you can consult.
Right.
They'll be a good source of reference
but the problem is they are sometimes too general.
Yes, that's what I've found.
Other than that, I would strongly advise quite simple ideas like using a card index.
Well, yes, I've never done that before.
It's simple, but it really works because you have to get points down in a small space.
Another thing I always advise is don't just take your notes and forget about them.
Read everything three times - that'll really fix them in your mind.
Yes, I can see it'd take discipline but...
Well, if you establish good study skills at this stage, they'll be with you all your life.
Oh yes. I completely agree.
It's just that I don't seem to be able to discipline myself.
I need to talk things over.
Well, we'll be continuing these tutorials of course.
Let's arrange next month's now. Let's see...
I can see you virtually any time during the week starting the 22nd of January.
What about the 24th?
I'm free in the afternoon.
Sorry, I'm booked then.
What about the following day?
The Thursday?
I can make the morning.
Fine, we'll go for the 25th then.
That's great, thanks.

1161,Cam9 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam9---test-3---part-4,58,"Good morning.
In the last few lectures, I've been talking about the history of domestic building construction.
But today I want to begin looking at some contemporary, experimental designs for housing.
So, I'm going to start with a house which is constructed more or less under the ground.
And one of the interesting things about this project is...
that the owners - both professionals but not architects - wanted to be closely involved,
so they decided to manage the project themselves.
Their chief aim was to create somewhere that was as environmentally-friendly as possible.
But at the same time they wanted to live somewhere peaceful -
they'd both grown up in a rural area and disliked urban life.
So the first thing they did was to look for a site.
And they found a disused stone quarry in a beautiful area.
The price was relatively low,
and they liked the idea of recycling the land, as it were.
As it was, the quarry was an ugly blot on the landscape,
and it wasn't productive any longer, either.
They consulted various architects
and looked at a number of designs before finally deciding on one.
As I've said,
it was a design for a sort of underground house,
and it was built into the earth itself, with two storeys.
The north, east and west sides were set in the earth,
and only the sloping, south-facing side was exposed to the light.
That was made of a double layer of very strong glass.
There were also photovoltaic tiles fixed to the top and bottom of this sloping wall.
These are tiles that are designed to store energy from the sun.
And the walls had a layer of foam around them too, to increase the insulation.
Now, what is of interest to us about this project
is the features which make the building energy-efficient.
Sunlight floods in through the glass wall,
and to maximise it, there are lots of mirrors and windows inside the house.
That helps to spread the light around.
So that's the first thing - light is utilised as fully as possible.
In addition, the special tiles on the outside convert energy from the sun
and generate some of the house's electricity.
In fact, and it's possible that in future the house may even generate an electricity surplus,
and that the owners will be able to sell some to the national grid.
As well as that, wherever possible, recycled materials have been used.
For example, the floors are made of reclaimed wood.
And the owners haven't bought a single item of new furniture -
they just kept what they already had.
And then there's the system for dealing with the waste produced in the house.
This is dealt with organically -
it's purified by being filtered through reed beds
which have been planted for that purpose in the garden.
So the occupants of the house won't pollute the land or use any damaging chemicals.
It's true that the actual construction of the house was harmful to the environment,
mainly because they had to use massive amounts of concrete -
one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide in manufacturing.
And, as you know, this is very damaging to the environment.
In total, the house construction has released 70 tons of carbon dioxide into the air.
Now that's a frightening thought.
However, once the initial 'debt' has been cleared -
and it's been calculated that this will only take fifteen years -
this underground house won't cost anything - environmentally I mean -
because unlike ordinary houses,
it is run in a way that is completely environmentally friendly.
So, eco-housing like this is likely to become...

1162,Cam9 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam9---test-4---part-1,62,"Can I help you?
Yes, I've just moved to this area with my wife and children
and I'd like to know where we can all register with a doctor at a Health Centre.
Okay.
Well, there's Doctor Green at The Harvey Clinic.
We always recommend her for babies, because she's very good with them and she runs a special clinic.
Oh... actually my youngest child is five, so that wouldn't be any good for us.
Right.
Is there anywhere else I could try?
Yes, the Eshcol Health Practice is the next one on my list.
How do you spell that?
ESHCOL.
And it's Doctor Fuller, who has space on his list.
The clinic only opened a year ago, so the facilities are all very modern.
That sounds good.
And it's particularly good if you're busy during the day,
because they also do appointments in the evening.
They're closed on Saturday, though.
The only other place on the list is the Health Centre on Shore Lane.
You can register with Doctor Gormley,
that's GORMLEY.
He's new there, but the centre has a very good reputation.
Oh yes, I think I know the road.
That would be the best one.
Thanks.
Could you tell me, will all their services be free?
Erm... there are usually some small charges that doctors make.
Let me see what it says about the Shore Lane Centre.
If you need to be vaccinated before any trips abroad, you won't have to pay for this.
Erm, what else?
The sports injury treatment service operates on a paying basis,
as does the nutritional therapy service.
Some health centres do offer alternative therapies like homeopathy as part of their pay-to-use service.
Shore Lane are hoping to do this soon.
I think they may start with acupuncture.
And finally, if you need to prove you're healthy
or haven't had any serious injuries before a new employer will accept you,
you can get a free fitness check-up there,
but you'd most likely have to pay for insurance medicals though.
Okay, thanks.
You might also be interested to know the Centre is running a pilot scheme of talks for patients.
I've got the list here.
Actually, they look very interesting.
What sort of things?
Well, the first one's about giving up smoking.
It's next week, the twenty-fifth of February, at 7 pm,
and that's in Room 4.
It says, the talk will stress the health benefits, particularly for people with asthma or heart disease.
That sounds very interesting.
There's also a talk for families with children.
It's on Healthy Eating, and takes place on the first of March at five o'clock.
Will that be at the Health Centre?
Erm, actually it's at the primary school on Shore Lane.
I imagine they're inviting the parents of pupils there - it says here 'all welcome'.
I might go to that if I have time.
There's a couple of other talks -
one giving advice about how to avoid injuries while doing exercise.
It's on the ninth of March.
Oh, it's a late afternoon talk, at 4:30
and it'll be in Room 6.
It also says the talk is suitable for all ages.
And finally, there's a talk called 'Stress Management'...

1163,Cam9 - Test 4 - Part 2,B1,cam9---test-4---part-2,83,"Hello?
Hi. It's Laura Cariton here.
We've just arrived at the holiday flat, but I can't get the hot water and heating to work.
Oh right!
That's easy.
Don't worry.
In the upstairs cupboard, you'll find the water heater.
You'll see three main controls on the left at the bottom of the heater.
The first one - the round one on the far left -
is the most important one for the heating and hot water.
It's the main control switch.
Make sure it's in the 'on' position.
The switch itself doesn't light up.
But the little square below will be black if the switch is 'off'.
That's probably what's happened - it's got switched off by mistake.
The middle one of these three controls - you'll see it's slightly larger than the first one - controls the radiators.
If you feel cold while you're there and need the radiators on,
this needs to be turned to maximum.
The last of the three controls - the one on the right -
is usually on about a number four setting which, for the water in the taps, is usually quite hot enough.
Below the heating controls in the middle is a small round plastic button.
If there isn't enough water in the pipes, sometimes the heater goes out.
If this happens you'll need to press this button to reset the heater.
Hold it in for about five seconds
and the heater should come on again.
Then there's a little square indicator under the third knob that's a kind of alarm light.
It'll flash if you need to reset the heater.
It sounds complicated...
I'm sure you won't have any problems with it.
There should be some more instructions on the side of the heater.
Call me back if you can't make it work.
Okay.
While you're on the phone, we haven't managed to find a few things we need,
like extra pillows for the beds and some washing powder.
Is there any here?
Pillows... yes.
If you look in the cupboard,
the large white one upstairs - to the left of the bathroom door -
there should be four or five on the top shelf.
And if you want to do some washing,
there's some powder for that...
probably by the back door.
There's a kind of shelf there above the sink.
In fact, I'm sure there's some there, in a large blue box.
You need about half a cup full for each wash.
Oh... and that reminds me,
the spare key to the back door is hanging on a hook on the wall by the sitting room window.
Please make sure to put it back when you've used it.
The previous guests lost it in the garden and I had to get another one made.
And, if you have any trouble with the lamps.
you'll find some spare bulbs in a large cardboard box.
It's on top of the washing machine with all kinds of useful things in it.
Oh, and another thing I forgot to mention when we last spoke...
Yes?
I've left you a local map, so you'll be able to find your way around easily.
It shows the whole area.
I put it in the top drawer of the chest under the TV in your bedroom.
There's a whole file of local information in there too.
Thanks.
What about visiting the town?
Can you give us any advice?
Yes.
You'll need to take the car.
It's too far to walk from the flat really.
You have to pay to leave your car in all the car parks now I'm afraid...
I like the one that's by the station best
and you can walk to the town centre from there in five minutes.
That's where all the best restaurants are.
But if you want a takeaway,
the Italian one does really good pasta and pizzas.
Call 732281 for that one,
or 766119 for the Chinese.
They're both good and they'll both deliver to the flat.
As for places to visit,
yes, do go and see the railway museum.
The exhibition is small but really good.
It gets very crowded on Sundays,
so I suggest you visit it on a quieter day, later in the week,
but not on Thursdays which is market day -
you won't find anywhere to park
and it's also the only day of the week when they're not open!
Anything else?
Not for the moment. Thanks!

1164,Cam9 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam9---test-4---part-3,79,"Hello, Kira, how are you?
Fine thanks, Paul, how are you?
Well, thanks.
It's good to see you.
It must be 12 months since you did our course?
That's right.
It's nice to come back and say hello.
What course did you enroll in?
Actually, I went straight into third year Pharmacy.
They credited me with two years, which probably made it more difficult for me.
On the other hand, you were lucky to be granted credits.
Is that why you chose the course?
Yes.
And, as I'd already finished a course in it in my country.
I thought it would be easier if I studied something I already knew.
I didn't realise you went into third year.
I thought you started in first year.
No wonder it was so hard!
And what do you think is one of the big differences between studying at a university here and studying in your country?
Well, I've found it very difficult to write assignments,
because I wasn't familiar with that aspect of the system here.
The main problem is that the lecturers expect you to be critical.
That made me feel really terrible.
I thought ""How can I possibly do it?""
""How can I comment on someone else's research when they probably spent five years doing it?""
I think a lot of people who come from overseas countries have similar problems.
But after a while, it became easier for me.
People expect you to have problems with the process of reading and writing
but, in fact, it is more a question of altering your viewpoint towards academic study.
How was the content of the lectures?
Was it easy for you?
I didn't really have many problems understanding lectures.
The content was very similar to what I'd studied before.
And what about the lecturers themselves?
Are they essentially the same as lecturers in your country?
Well, actually, no.
Here, they're much easier to approach.
After every lecture, you can go and ask them something you didn't understand.
Or you can make an appointment and talk to them about anything in the course.
Maybe you found them different because you're a more mature student now,
whereas when you were studying in your country, you were younger and not so assertive.
No, I don't think that's the difference.
Most of the students here do it.
In my faculty, they all seem to make appointments -
usually to talk about something in the course that's worrying them,
but sometimes just about something that might really interest them,
something they might want to specialise in.
The lecturers must set aside certain times every week when they're available for students.
That's good to hear.
And how was your timetable?
Was it a very busy year?
Very, very busy.
They make you work very hard.
Apart from lectures, we had practical sessions in a lot of subjects.
We did these in small groups.
I had to go and work four hours every week in a community pharmacy.
Actually, I enjoyed this very much - meeting new people all the time.
Then in second semester, we had to get experience in hospital dispensaries,
so every second day we went to one of the big hospitals and worked there.
And on top of all that we had our assignments,
which took me a lot of time.
Oh, I nearly forgot, between first and second semesters,
we had to work full-time for two weeks in a hospital.
That does sound a very heavy year.
So are you pleased now that you did it?
Do you feel some sense of achievement?
Yeah, I do feel much more confident,
which I suppose is the most important thing.
And have you got any recommendations for people who are studying from overseas?
Well, I suppose they need very good English.
It would be much better if they spent more time learning English before they enter the university,
because you can be in big trouble if you don't understand what people are saying
and you haven't got time to translate.
Anything else?
Well, as I said before,
the biggest problem for me was a lack of familiarity with the education system here.
It sounds as if it was a real challenge.
Congratulations, Kira.
Thanks, Paul.

1165,Cam9 - Test 4 - Part 4,B2,cam9---test-4---part-4,60,"Good morning.
Today I'd like to present the findings of our Year 2 project on wildlife found in gardens throughout our city.
I'll start by saying something about the background to the project,
then talk a little bit about our research techniques,
and then indicate some of our interim findings.
First of all, how did we choose our topic?
Well, there are four of us in the group and one day while we were discussing a possible focus,
two of the group mentioned that they had seen yet more sparrow-hawks - one of Britain's most interesting birds of prey -
in their own city centre gardens
and wondered why they were turning up in these gardens in great numbers.
We were all very engaged by the idea of why wild animals would choose to inhabit a city garden.
Why is it so popular with wildlife when the countryside itself is becoming less so?
The first thing we did was to establish what proportion of the urban land is taken up by private gardens.
We estimated that it was about 1/5,
and this was endorsed by looking at large-scale usage maps in the town land survey office -
24% to be precise.
Our own informal discussions with neighbours and friends led us to believe that
many garden owners had interesting experiences to relate regarding wild animal sightings
so we decided to survey garden owners from different areas of the city.
Just over 100 of them completed a survey once every two weeks for twelve months -
ticking off species they had seen from a pro forma list -
and adding the names of any rarer ones.
Meanwhile, we were doing our own observations in selected gardens throughout the city.
We deliberately chose smaller ones because they were by far the most typical in the city.
The whole point of the project was to look at the norm not the exception.
Alongside this primary research on urban gardens,
we were studying a lot of books about the decline of wild animals in the countryside
and thinking of possible causes for this.
So what did we find?
Well, so much that I just won't have time to tell you about here.
If you're interested in reading our more comprehensive findings,
we've produced detailed graphic representations on the college website
and of course any of the group would be happy to talk to you about them.
Just email us.
What we've decided to present today is information about just three species -
because we felt these gave a good indication of the processes at work
in rural and urban settings as a whole.
The first species to generate a lot of interesting information was frogs.
And there was a clear pattern here -
they proliferate where there is suitable water.
Garden ponds are on the increase,
rural ponds are disappearing,
leading to massive migration to the towns.
Hedgehogs are also finding it easier to live in urban areas -
this time because their predators are not finding it quite so attractive to leave their rural environment,
so hedgehogs have a better survival rate in cities.
We had lots of sightings,
so all in all, we had no difficulties with our efforts to count their numbers precisely.
Our final species is the finest of bird singers, the song thrush.
On the decline in the countryside,
they are experiencing a resurgence in urban gardens
because these days gardeners are buying lots of different plants
which means there's an extensive range of seeds around,
which is what they feed on.
Another factor is the provision of nesting places -
which is actually better in gardens than the countryside.
Hard to believe it, but it's true.
Incidentally, we discovered that a massive new survey on song thrushes is about to be launched,
so you should keep an eye open for that.
Now, I'd be happy to answer...

1166,Cam8 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam8---test-1---part-1,71,"Hi, George!
Glad you're back.
Loads of people have phoned you.
Really?
I felt just like your secretary!
Sorry!
I went into the library this afternoon to have a look at a newspaper and I came across something really interesting.
What? A book?
No, a brochure from a summer festival - mainly Spanish music.
Look, I've got it here.
Spanish music?
I really love the guitar.
Let's have a look.
So what's this group 'Guitarrini'?
They're really good.
They had a video with all the highlights of the festival at a stand in the lobby to the library,
so I heard them.
They play fantastic instruments - drums and flutes and old kinds of guitars.
I've never heard anything like it before.
Sounds great.
Okay. Shall we go then?
Spoil ourselves?
Yes, let's.
The only problem is there aren't any cheap seats‚Ä¶
it's all one price.
Well, in that case we could sit right at the front -
we'd have a really good view.
Yeah, though I think that if you sit at the back you can actually hear the whole thing better.
Yes, anyway we can decide when we get there.
So will you fill in the form or shall I?
I'll do it.
Name: George O'Neill.
Address:
48 North Avenue, Westsea.
Do you remember our new postcode?
Still can't remember it.
Just a minute, I've got it written down here.
WS62YH
Do you need the phone too?
Please.
I'm really bad at numbers.
01674553242.
So, let's book two tickets for Guitarrini.
Okay.
If you're sure 7.50 each is alright.
How do you feel about the singer?
I haven't quite decided.
But I've noticed something on the booking form that might just persuade me!
What's that then?
Free refreshments!
Really?
Yes, look here.
Sunday 17th of June.
Singer, ticket ¬£6 includes drinks in the garden.
Sounds like a bargain to me!
Yes, let's book two tickets for that.
So, what else?
I'm feeling quite keen now!
How about the pianist on the 22nd of June?
Anna Ventura?
I've just remembered that's my evening class night.
That's okay.
I'll just have to go on my own -
but we can go to the Spanish dance and guitar concert together, can't we?
Yes - I'm sure Tom and Kieran would enjoy that too.
Good heavens - ¬£10.50 a ticket!
I can see we're going to have to go without food for the rest of the week -
we'll need to book four!
Wish we were students - look!
Children, students and senior citizens get a 50% discount on everything.
If only!

1167,Cam8 - Test 1 - Part 2,B1,cam8---test-1---part-2,58,"Hello, and thank you for asking me to your teachers' meeting to talk about the Dinosaur Museum
and to tell you a bit about what you can do with your students there.
Well, let me give you some of the basic information first.
In regard to opening hours,
we're open every day of the week from 9 am to 8 pm
except on Mondays when we close at 1.30 pm.
And, in fact the only day in the year when we're closed is on the 25th of December.
You can book a guided tour for your school group any time that we're open.
If you bring a school group to the museum,
when you arrive we ask you to remain with your group in the car park.
One or more of the tour guides will welcome you there
and brief you about what the tour will be about.
We do this there because our entrance is quite small
and we really haven't got much room for briefing groups in the exhibition area.
As far as the amount of time you'll need goes,
if you bring a school group,
you should plan on allowing a minimum of 90 minutes for the visit.
This allows 15 minutes to get on and off the coach,
45 minutes for the guided tour
and 30 minutes for after-tour activities.
If you're going to have lunch at the museum,
you will, of course, have to allow more time.
There are two caf√©s in the museum, with seating for 80 people.
If you want to eat there you'll need to reserve some seating,
as they can get quite crowded at lunch time.
Then outside the museum at the back there are tables,
and students can bring their own lunch and eat it there in the open air.
When the students come into the museum foyer,
we ask them to check in their backpacks with their books, lunch boxes, etc, at the cloakroom
before they enter the museum proper.
I'm afraid in the past, we have had a few things gone missing after school visits,
so this is a strict rule.
Also, some of the exhibits are fragile
and we don't want them to be accidentally knocked.
But we do provide school students with handouts with questions and quizzes on them.
There's so much that students can learn in the museum
and it's fun for them to have something to do.
Of course, they'll need to bring something to write with for these.
We do allow students to take photographs.
For students who are doing projects
it's useful to make some kind of visual record of what they see
that they can add to their reports.
And finally, they should not bring anything to eat into the museum,
or drinks of any kind.
There are also a few things the students can do after the tour.
In the threatrette on the ground floor,
there are continuous screenings of short documentaries about dinosaurs which they can see at any time.
We used to have an activity room with more interactive things like making models of dinosaurs
and drawing and painting pictures, even hunting for dinosaur eggs,
but, unfortunately, the room was damaged in a bad storm recently when water came in the roof,
so that's closed at the moment.
But we do have an IT centre
where students have access to CD ROMs with a range of dinosaur games.
These games are a lot of fun,
but they also teach the students about the lives of dinosaurs,
how they found food, protected their habitat, survived threats, that kind of thing.
And‚Ä¶ I think that's all I have to tell you.
Please feel free to ask any questions if you would like to know anything else‚Ä¶
",https://dailydictation.com/upload/ielts-listening/ielts-cambridge-8-test-1-part-2-2023-07-24-23-13-25/0-ielts-cambridge-8-test-1-part-2.mp3,4,62
1168,Cam8 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam8---test-1---part-3,10,"Right, Sandra.
You wanted to see me to get some feedback on your group's proposal.
The one you're submitting for the Geography Society field trip competition.
I've had a look through your proposal and I think it's a really good choice.
In fact, I only have a few things to say about it, but...
even in an outline document like this,
you really have to be careful to avoid typos and problems with layout in the proposal,
and even in the contents page.
So read it through carefully before submitting it, okay?
Will do.
And, I've made a few notes on the proposal about things which could have been better sequenced.
Okay.
As for the writing itself,
I've annotated the proposal as and where I thought it could be improved.
Generally speaking, I feel you've often used complex structures and long sentences for the sake of it
and as a consequence‚Ä¶.
although your paragraphing and inclusion of sub-headings help‚Ä¶
it's quite hard to follow your train of thought at times.
So cut them down a bit, can you?
Really?
Yes. And don't forget simple formatting like numbering.
Didn't I use page numbers?
I didn't mean that.
Look, you've remembered to include headers and footers, which is good,
but listing ideas clearly is important.
Number them or use bullet points, which is even clearer.
Then you'll focus the reader on your main points.
I thought your suggestion to go to the Navajo Tribal Park was a very good idea.
I've always wanted to go there.
My father was a great fan of cowboy films and the Wild West
so I was subjected to seeing all the epics,
many of which were shot there.
As a consequence, it feels very familiar to me
and it's awesome both geographically and visually,
so it's somewhere I've always wanted to visit.
The subsequent research I did
and the online photographs made me even keener.
Interesting.
Right, let's look at the content of your proposal now.
Did you find it comprehensive enough?
Well, yes and no.
You've listed several different topics on your contents page,
but I'm not sure they're all relevant.
No?
Well, I thought that from the perspective of a field trip,
one thing I needed to focus on was the sandstone plateau and cliffs themselves.
The way they tower up from the flat landscape is just amazing.
The fact that the surrounding softer rocks were eroded by wind and rain,
leaving these huge outcrops high above the plain.
It's hardly surprising that tourists flock to see the area.
Well, yes.
I'd agree with including those points‚Ä¶
And then the fact that it's been home to native American Navajos
and all the social history that goes with that.
The hardships they endured trying to save their territory from the invading settlers.
Their culture is so rich - all those wonderful stories.
Well, I agree it's interesting, but...
it's not immediately relevant to your proposal, Sandra, so...
at this stage, I suggest you focus on other considerations.
I think an indication of what the students on the trip could actually do when they get there
should be far more central,
so that certainly needs to be included and to be expanded upon.
And I'd like to see something about the local wildlife, and vegetation too,
not that I imagine there's much to see.
Presumably the tourist invasion hasn't helped.
Okay, I'll do some work on those two areas as well.
But you're right, there's not much apart from some very shallow-rooted species.
Although it's cold and snowy there in the winter,
the earth is baked so hard in the summer sun that rainwater can't penetrate.
So it's a case of flood or drought, really.
So, I understand.
Now, before we look at everything in more detail,
I've got a few factual questions for you.
It would be a good idea to include the answers in your finished proposal,
because they're missing from your draft.
Fine.
So, you mentioned the monoliths and the spires, which was good,
but what area does the tribal park cover?
Do you know?
12,000 hectares,
and the plain is at about 5,850 metres above sea level.
Larger than I expected.
Okay.
Where's the nearest accommodation?
That's a practical detail that you haven't included.
Have you done any research on that?
Yes.
There's nowhere to stay in the park itself,
but there's an old trading post called Goulding quite near.
All kinds of tours start from Goulding, too.
What kind of tours?
Well, the most popular are in four-wheel drive jeeps -
but I wouldn't recommend hiring those.
I think the best way to appreciate the area would be to hire horses instead
and trek around on those.
Biking is not allowed
and it's impossible to drive around the area in private vehicles.
The tracks are too rough.
Okay, lastly. What else is worth visiting there?
There are several caves,
but I haven't looked into any details.
I'll find out about them.
Okay, good.
Now what I'd like to know is‚Ä¶
",https://dailydictation.com/upload/ielts-listening/ielts-cambridge-8-test-1-part-3-2023-07-24-23-13-52/0-ielts-cambridge-8-test-1-part-3.mp3,4,62
1169,Cam8 - Test 1 - Part 4,B2,cam8---test-1---part-4,84,"So, welcome to your introductory geography lecture.
We'll begin with some basics.
Firstly, what do we learn by studying geography?
Well, we learn a great deal about all the processes
that have affected and that continue to affect the earth's surface.
But we learn far more than that,
because studying geography also informs us about the different kinds of relationships
that develop between a particular environment and the people that live there.
Okay.
We like to think of geography as having two main branches.
There's the study of the nature of our planet -
its physical features, what it actually looks like -
and then there's the study of the ways in which we choose to live
and of the impact of those on our planet.
Our current use of carbon fuels is a good example of that.
But there are more specific study areas to consider too,
and we'll be looking at each of these in turn throughout this semester.
These include bio-physical geography,
by which I mean the study of the natural environment and all its living things.
Then there's topography -
that looks at the shapes of the land and oceans.
There's the study of political geography and social geography too, of course,
which is the study of communities of people.
We have economic geography -
in which we examine all kinds of resource and their use - agriculture, for example.
Next comes historical geography -
the understanding of how people and their environments
and the ways they interact have changed over a period of time -
and urban geography,
an aspect I'm particularly interested in,
which takes as its focus: the location of cities,
the services that those cities provide.
and migration of people to and from such cities.
And lastly, we have cartography.
That's the art and science of map-making.
You'll be doing a lot of that!
So, to summarise before we continue,
we now have our key answer‚Ä¶
studying this subject is important
because without geographical knowledge, we would know very little about our surroundings
and we wouldn't be able to identify all the problems that relate to them.
So, by definition, we wouldn't be in an informed position to work out how to solve any of them.
Okay, now for some practicalities.
What do geographers actually do?
Well, we collect data to begin with!
You'll be doing a lot of that on your first field trip!
How do we do this?
There are several means.
We might, for example, conduct a census -
count a population in a given area perhaps.
We also need images of the earth's surface
which we can produce by means of computer-generation technology
or with the help of satellite relays.
We've come a very long way from the early exploration of the world by sailing ships
when geographers only had pens and paper at their disposal.
After we've gathered our information, we must analyse it!
We need to look for patterns, most commonly those of causes and consequences.
This kind of information helps us to predict and resolve problems that could affect the world we live in.
But we don't keep all this information confidential.
We then need to publish our findings so that other people can access it and be informed by it.
And one way which this information can be published is in the form of maps.
You'll all have used one at some stage of your life already.
Let's consider the benefits of maps from a geographer's perspective.
Maps can be folded and put in a pocket
and can provide a great store of reference when they're collected into an atlas.
They can depict the physical features of the entire planet if necessary,
or just a small part of it in much greater detail.
But there is a drawback.
You can't exactly replicate something that is three-dimensional, like our planet, on a flat piece of paper,
because paper has only two dimensions,
and that means there'll always be a certain degree of distortion on a map.
It can't be avoided.
We can also use aerial photographs‚Ä¶
pictures taken by cameras at high altitude above the earth.
These are great for showing all kinds of geographical features that are not easy to see from the ground.
You can easily illustrate areas of diseased trees or how much traffic is on the road at a given time
or information about deep sea beds, for example.
Then there are Landsats.
These are satellites that circle the earth
and transmit visual information to computers at receiving stations.
They circle the earth several times a day
and can provide a mass of information -
you'll all be familiar with the information they give us about the weather, for example.
So, what we're going to do now is look at a short presentation‚Ä¶

1170,Cam8 - Test 2 - Part 1,B1,cam8---test-2---part-1,90,"Good morning. Total Insurance.
Judy speaking, how may I help you?
I recently shipped my belongings from overseas back here to Australia
and I took out insurance with your company.
Some items were damaged during the move so I need to make a claim.
What do I have to do?
Okay, well first I need to get a few details about this.
Can you give me your name please?
Yes. It's Michael Alexander.
Okay. And your address, please?
My old address or my current one?
Your current one.
It's 24 Manly Street, Milperra near Sydney.
What was the suburb, sorry?
Milperra.
MILPERRA.
Right.
Now, who was the shipping agent, Mr Alexander?
You mean the company we used?
Yes, the company who packed everything up at the point of origin.
Oh, it was‚Ä¶ erm‚Ä¶
First Class Movers.
Okay‚Ä¶
where were the goods shipped from?
China,
but the ship came via Singapore and was there for about a week.
Don't worry, all of that information will be in the documentation.
Now, the dates.
Do you know when the ship arrived?
It left on the 11th of October
and got to Sydney on the 28th of November.
Okay.
I need one more thing.
There's a reference number.
It should be in the top right-hand corner of the pink form they gave you.
Uh... let me have a look.
Uh, yes, here it is.
It's 601ACK.
Thanks.
I need to take down a few details of the actual damage over the phone before you put in a full report.
Can you tell me how many items were damaged and what the damage was?
Yes, well four things actually.
I'll start with the big things.
My TV first of all.
It's a large one‚Ä¶ very expensive.
Our insurance doesn't cover electrical problems.
It isn't an electrical problem.
The screen has a huge crack in it so it's unusable.
I see.
Any idea of the price to repair it?
No.
Well, I don't think it can be repaired.
It will need a new one.
Okay.
I'll make a note of that and we'll see what we can do.
Now, what was the second item?
The cabinet from the bathroom was damaged as well.
It's a lovely cabinet, we use it to keep our towels in.
And what is the extent of the damage?
Well, the back and the sides seem okay
but the door has a huge hole in it.
It can't be repaired.
I'm really not very happy about it.
And how much do you think it will cost to replace it?
Well, when I bought it last year, I paid $125 for it.
But the one I've seen here in Sydney is a bit more expensive,
it's $140.
Right, and what was the third item?
My dining room table.
It's a lovely table from Indonesia.
It must have been very hot inside the container
because one leg has completely split down the middle.
The top and the other three look okay, thank goodness.
Any idea of the price to repair it?
Well, I had an estimate done on this actually because it is a very special table to us.
They quoted us $200, which is really pricey
so I hope the insurance will cover the total cost.
I'm sure that will be fine.
What was the last item, Mr Alexander?
Well, we have a lovely set of china plates and dishes,
you know, with matching cups, saucers, the lot.
They were all in the one box which must have got dropped because some plates were broken - six actually.
And can you tell me the replacement value of these?
Well, it's hard to say because they were part of a set
but they can be up to $10 each as it's such a good set.
Okay, so that would be around $60 altogether?
Yes, that's right.
And is that all of the items?
Yes.
So what do I have to do now?

1171,Cam8 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam8---test-2---part-2,61,"Welcome to Green Vale Agricultural Park.
As you know, we have only been open a week,
so you are amongst our first visitors.
We have lots of fascinating indoor and outdoor exhibits on our huge complex, spreading hundreds of hectares.
Our remit is to give educational opportunities to the wider public
as well as to offer research sites for a wide variety of agriculturists and other scientists.
Let's start by seeing what there is to do.
As you can see here on our giant wall plan,
we are now situated in the Reception block‚Ä¶ here.
As you walk out of the main door into the park,
there's a path you can follow.
If you follow this route,
you will immediately come into the Rare Breeds section,
where we keep a wide variety of animals
which I shall be telling you a little more about later.
Next to this‚Ä¶ moving east‚Ä¶ is the large grazing area for the rare breeds.
Then further east‚Ä¶ in the largest section of our Park is the Forest Area.
South of the grazing area, and in fact, just next to the Reception block is our Experimental Crop Area.
In the middle of the Park‚Ä¶ this circular area is our lake‚Ä¶
These two small rectangular shapes here‚Ä¶
are the Fish Farms where we rear fish for sale.
To the east of those is the marsh area,
which attracts a great many migrant birds
In the south-eastern corner, beyond the marsh,
is our Market Garden area, growing vegetables and flowers.
All these areas can be visited by the general public for almost all the year‚Ä¶
although‚Ä¶ please take note of the large signs at the entrance to each area
which tell you when certain areas are being used for particular controlled experiments
and are therefore temporarily out of bounds to the public.
You can see for yourself what a huge area the park covers
and a key question is always, how can we move around?
Well you have a choice of means‚Ä¶
all environmentally friendly‚Ä¶
cars are banned in the park.
We have bicycles which you can hire behind the Reception block‚Ä¶ here‚Ä¶
the healthy ones of you can go on foot
and finally there's our electric tram, powered from solar cells.
You find more information about this at the front entrance.
A good place to start on your tour is the Rare Breeds section.
We keep goats, sheep and hens and other kinds of poultry.
We are also thinking of bringing in cows and horses
but we do not, as yet, have facilities for these bigger animals.
The animals are fed in public twice a day
and a short lecture given on their feeding habits and nutritional needs.
These are very popular with the public but...
of course we mustn't lose sight of the main purpose of having this section,
not as such to preserve rare animals but to maintain the diversity of breeds
to broaden the gene pool for agricultural development.
Green Vale changes with the seasons with different events happening at different times of the year.
May will be perhaps our most spectacular month with the arrival of the Canada geese
and when our fruit trees will be in full blossom,
but there are interesting events on all year round‚Ä¶.
for example John Havers, our expert fly fisherman, is currently giving displays on the lake.
Each of the sections has its own seasonal calendar‚Ä¶
please consult the summary board at the main entrance.
And the final section, as we return to the Reception blocks, is the orchard.
Do take time to browse round our shop‚Ä¶
there's a wide selection of books on wildlife,
some of them written by local authors,
and the history of farming, including organic farming,
something which the park will be diversifying into in the coming months.

1172,Cam8 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam8---test-2---part-3,68,"Good morning, everyone.
In today's seminar, Grant Freeman, a biologist who specialises in identifying insects,
and who works for the Australian Quarantine Service,
has come to talk to us about his current research work.
Right, well, over to you, Grant.
Good morning, everyone.
I'm sure that you know that the quarantine service regulates all food brought into Australia.
Well, obviously they want to protect Australia from diseases that might come in with imported goods,
but they also want to prevent insect pests from being introduced into the country,
and that's where I have a part to play.
Anyway, my current research involves trying to find a particular type of bee:
the Asian Honey Bee
and finding out whether there are any of them around in various states of Australia.
We discovered a few of them in Queensland once and eradicated them.
Now, we're pretty keen to make sure that there aren't any more getting in,
particularly to New South Wales and other states.
What's wrong with Asian Honey Bees?
Are they so different from Australian bees?
Well, in fact, they look almost the same,
but they are infested with mites -
microscopic creatures which live on them,
and which can seriously damage our own home-grown bees, or could even wipe them out.
Well, what would happen if Australian bees died out?
Well, the honey from Australian bees is of excellent quality,
much better than the stuff the Asian bees produce.
In fact, Australia exports native Queen bees to a large number of countries because of this.
When the European Honey Bee was first discovered out in the bush,
we found they made really unpleasant honey
and they were also too big to pollinate many of our native flowers here in Australia.
That must have had a devastating effect on the natural flora.
Did you lose any species?
No, we managed to get them under control before that happened
but if Asian bees got in there could be other consequences.
We could lose a lot of money because you might not be aware,
but it's estimated that native bees' pollination of flower and vegetable crops is worth 1.2 billion dollars a year.
So in a way they're the farmer's friend.
Oh, and another thing is, if you're stung by an Asian Honey Bee,
it can produce an allergic reaction in some people;
so they're much more dangerous than native bees.
How will you know if Asian bees have entered Australia?
We're looking at the diet of the bird called the Rainbow Bee Eater.
The Bee Eater doesn't care what it eats, as long as they're insects.
But the interesting thing about this bird is that we are able to analyse exactly what it eats
and that's really helpful if we're looking for introduced insects.
How come?
Because insects have their skeletons outside their bodies,
so the Bee Eaters digest the meat from the inside.
Then they bring up all the indigestible bits of skeleton
and, of course, the wings in a pellet -
a small ball of waste material which they cough up.
That sounds a bit unpleasant.
So, how do you go about it?
In the field, we track down the Bee Eaters and find their favourite feeding spots,
you know, the places where the birds usually feed.
It's here that we can find the pellets.
We collect them up and take them back to the laboratory to examine the contents.
How do you do that?
The pellets are really hard, especially if they have been out in the sun for a few days
so, first of all, we treat them by adding water to moisten them and make them softer.
Then we pull them apart under the microscope.
Everything's all scrunched up but we're looking for wings so we just pull them all out and straighten them.
Then we identify them to see if we can find any Asian bee wings.
And how many have you found?
So far our research shows that Asian bees have not entered Australia in any number -
it's a good result and much more reliable than trying to find live ones as evidence of introduced insects.
Well, that's fascinating!
Thank you, Grant, for those insights.
I hope that you might inspire some of our students here to conduct some similar experiments.

1173,Cam8 - Test 2 - Part 4,C1,cam8---test-2---part-4,65,"I've been doing some research into what people in Britain think of doctors,
the ones who work in general practice - the first call for medical care -
and comparing this with the situation in a couple of other countries.
I want to talk about the rationale behind what I decided to do.
Now I had to set up my programme of research in three different countries
so I approached postgraduates in my field in overseas departments,
contacting them by email, to organize things for me at their end.
I thought I would have trouble recruiting help
but in fact everyone was very willing and sometimes their tutors got involved too.
I had to give my helpers clear instructions about what kind of sample population I wanted them to use.
I decided that people under 18 should be excluded
because most of them are students or looking for their first job,
and also I decided at this stage, just to focus on men who were in employment,
and set up something for people who didn't have jobs
and for employed women later on as a separate investigation.
I specifically wanted to do a questionnaire,
and interviews with a focus group.
With the questionnaire, rather than limiting it to one specific point,
I wanted to include as much variety as possible.
I know questionnaires are a very controlled way to do things
but I thought I could do taped interviews later on to counteract the effects of this.
And the focus group may also prove useful in future,
by targeting subjects I can easily return to,
as the participants tend to be more involved.
So I'm just collating the results now.
At the moment, it looks as if, in the UK,
despite the fact that newspapers continually report that people are unhappy with medical care,
in fact, it is mainly the third level of care,
which takes place in hospitals, that they are worried about.
Government reforms have been proposed at all levels
and although their success is not guaranteed,
long-term hospital care is in fact probably less of an issue
than the media would have us believe.
However, I've still got quite a bit of data to look at.
Certainly I will need to do more far-reaching research than I had anticipated
in order to establish if people want extra medical staff invested in the community,
or if they want care to revert to fewer, but larger, key medical units.
The solution may well be something that can be easily implemented
by those responsible in local government,
with central government support, of course.
This first stage has proved very valuable though.
I was surprised by how willing most of the subjects were to get involved in the project -
I had expected some unwillingness to answer questions honestly.
But I was taken aback and rather concerned that something I thought I'd set up very well...
didn't necessarily seem that way to everyone in my own department.
I thought you might also be interested in some of the problems I encountered in collecting my data.
There were odd cases that threw me -
one of the subjects who I had approached while he was out shopping in town,
decided to pull out when it came to the second round.
It was a shame as it was someone who I would like to have interviewed more closely.
And one of the first-year students I interviewed
wanted reassurance that no names would be traceable from the answers.
I was so surprised,
because they think nothing of telling you about themselves and their opinions in seminar groups!
Then, one of the people that I work with got a bit funny.
The questions were quite personal
and one minute he said he'd do it,
then the next day he wouldn't,
and in the end he did do it.
It's hard not to get angry in that situation
but I tried to keep focused on the overall picture in order to stay calm.
The most bizarre case was a telephone interview I did with a teacher at a university in France.
He answered all my questions in great detail -
but then when I asked how much access he had to dangerous substances,
he wouldn't tell me exactly what his work involved.

1174,Cam8 - Test 3 - Part 1,B1,cam8---test-3---part-1,74,"Good morning. How can I help you?
Hello. I'm interested in renting a house somewhere in the town.
Right.
Could I have your name please?
Yes, it's Steven Godfrey.
And tell me how many bedrooms you're looking for.
Well, we'd need 4, because I'm going to share the house with 3 friends.
Okay, there are several of that size on our books.
They mostly belong to families who are working abroad at the moment.
What about the location?
It'd be nice to be central.
That might be difficult, as most houses of that size are in the suburbs.
Still, there are a few.
What's your upper limit for the rent?
We'd like something around ¬£500 a month,
but we could go up to ¬£600 if we have to.
But we can't go beyond that.
Do you know how long you want to rent the house for?
The minimum let is 6 months, as you probably realise.
We're at college here for two years,
and we don't want to have to move during that time if we can avoid it.
Right.
And how soon do you want to move in?
All our lets start on the first of the month.
Well, as soon as possible, really, so that means September 1st.
Okay, let me have a look at what we've got‚Ä¶.
We have photographs of all the houses on our books, so you can get an idea of what they're like.
There's this one in Oakington Avenue, at ¬£550 a month.
Combined living room and dining room, with a separate kitchen.
It doesn't have a garage, though you can park in the road.
Ah, we'd prefer to have one, if possible.
Right.
Then have a look at this house, in Mead Street.
It's got a very large living room and kitchen, bathroom, cloakroom...
How much is it?
That one's 580.
It's very well furnished and equipped.
It also has plenty of space for parking, and it's available for a minimum of a year.
Oh, and there's a big garden.
I don't think we could cope with that, to be honest.
We'll be too busy to look after it.
Okay.
Then there's this older house in Hamilton Road:
living room, kitchen-diner, and it has a study.
550 a month.
That looks rather nice.
But whereabouts in Hamilton Road?
Towards the western end.
Oh, that'll be very noisy. I know the area.
Yes, it's pretty lively.
Some people like it, though.
Well, what about this house in Devon Close?
That looks lovely.
There's a big demand for houses in that area, so prices tend to be quite high.
But this one hasn't been decorated for a few years, which has kept the rent down a bit.
It's got a living room, dining room and small kitchen,
and it's 595 a month.
I think it would suit you, from what you've said.
It sounds fine.
Why's that part of town so popular?
Well, there's a big scheme to improve the district, and it'll soon have the best facilities for miles around.
What sort of thing?
There's a big sports centre under construction, which will be very impressive when it's finished.
In fact, the swimming pool's already opened, ahead of schedule,
and it's attracting a lot of people.
What about cinemas: are there any in the area?
The only one closed down last year,
and it's now in the process of being converted into a film museum.
The local people are trying to get a new cinema added to the scheme.
I think I heard something about a plan to replace the existing concert hall with a larger one.
Ah, that's due to start next year.
Well, it sounds an interesting area to live in.
Could I go and see the house, please?
Yes, of course.

1175,Cam8 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam8---test-3---part-2,58,"Hello, and welcome to ""Focus on the Arts"".
I'm your host - Dave Green -
and this is your very own local radio programme.
Every Friday evening we put the spotlight on different arts and culture facilities,
and look at the shows and events that are on offer in the coming week.
And today the focus is on The National Arts Centre.
Now, if you don't already know it yourself,
I'm sure you've all heard of it.
It's famous throughout the world as one of the major venues for classical music.
But did you know that it is actually much more than just a place to hear concerts?
The Centre itself is a huge complex that caters for a great range of arts.
Under a single roof it houses concert rooms, theatres, cinemas, art galleries
and a wonderful public library,
as well as service facilities including three restaurants and a bookshop.
So at any one time, the choice of entertainment there is simply enormous.
So, how did they manage to build such a big arts complex right in the heart of the city?
Well, the area was completely destroyed by bombs during the war in 1940.
So the opportunity was taken to create a cultural centre that would be...
what they called: 'The City's gift to the Nation'.
Of course, it took a while for such a big project to get started,
but it was planned in the 60s, built in the 70s
and eventually opened to the public in 1983.
Ever since then, it has proved to be a great success.
It is not privately owned, like many arts centres,
but is still in public hands - it's run by the City Council.
Both our National Symphony Orchestra and National Theater Company were involved in the planning of the project,
and they are now based there - giving regular performances every week -
and as the Centre is open 363 days of the year,
there are plenty of performances to choose from.
So, to give you some idea of what's on,
and to help you choose from the many possibilities,
we've made a selection of the star attractions.
If you're interested in classical music,
then we recommend you go along to the National on either Monday or Tuesday evening at 7.30
for a spectacular production of 'The Magic Flute' -
probably the most popular of all Mozart's operas.
It's in the Garden Hall and tickets start at only ¬£8,
but you'll have to be early if you want to get them that cheap!
And remember, it's only on for those two evenings.
For those more interested in the cinema,
you might like to see the new Canadian film
which is showing on Wednesday evening at 8 pm in Cinema 2.
And that's called 'Three Lives'.
It's had fantastic reviews
and tickets cost just ¬£4.50,
which is a reduction on the usual price of ¬£5.50.
So, it's really good value, especially for such a great movie.
But you can see the centre's main attraction at the weekend,
because on Saturday and Sunday, 11 am to 10 pm,
they're showing a wonderful new exhibition that hasn't been seen anywhere else in Europe yet.
It's a collection of Chinese Art called 'Faces of China' - that's in Gallery 1 -
and it has some really fascinating paintings and sculptures by leading artists from all over China -
and the good news is that it's completely free, so don't miss it!
So why not go along to the National Art Centre next week for one - or all - of these great events -
and you can always pick up a programme
and check out all the other performances and exhibitions on offer, or coming soon,
on almost every day of the year.
Next week, we'll be looking at the new Museum of Science‚Ä¶

1176,Cam8 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam8---test-3---part-3,87,"I've been reading your personal statement, Paul.
First, let's talk about your work experience in South America.
What took you there?
Was it to gain more fluency in Spanish?
Well, as I'm combining Spanish with Latin American studies,
my main idea was to find out more about the way people lived there.
My spoken Spanish was already pretty good in fact.
So you weren't too worried about language barriers?
No.
In fact, I ended up teaching English there,
although that wasn't my original choice of work.
I see.
How did you find out about all this?
I found an agency that runs all kinds of voluntary projects in South America.
What kind of work?
Well, there were several possibilities.
You mean construction? Engineering work?
Yes, getting involved in building projects was an option.
Then there was tourism - taking tourists for walks around the volcanoes -
which I actually chose to do,
and then there was work with local farmers.
But you didn't continue with that project. Why not?
Because I never really knew whether I'd be needed or not.
I'd thought it might be difficult physically, but I was certainly fit enough‚Ä¶
now, I wanted to do something that had more of a proper structure to it, I suppose,
I get demotivated otherwise.
What do you think you learned from your experience?
It must have been a great opportunity to examine community life.
Yes, but it was difficult at first to be accepted by the locals.
It was a very remote village
and some of them were reluctant to speak to me -
although they were always interested in my clothes and how much I'd had to pay for them.
Well, that's understandable.
Yes, but things soon improved.
What struck me was that when people became more comfortable with me and less suspicious,
we really connected with each other in a meaningful way.
You made good friends?
Yes, with two of the families in particular.
Good.
What about management.
Did you have a project manager?
Yes, and he gave me lots of advice and guidance.
And was he good at managing too?
That wasn't his strong point!
I think he was often more interested in the academic side of things than filling reports.
He was a bit of a dreamer.
And did you have a contract?
I had to stay for a minimum of three months.
My parents were surprised when I asked to stay longer - six months in the end.
I was so happy there.
And did anything on the administration side of things surprise you?
What was the food and lodging like?
Simple‚Ä¶ but there was plenty to eat and I only paid $7 a day for that, which was amazing really.
And they gave me all the equipment I needed‚Ä¶ even a laptop.
You didn't expect that then?
No.
Well, I'll look forward to hearing more.
But now let's look at these modules.
You'll need to start thinking about which ones you'll definitely want to study.
The first one here is Gender Studies in Latin America.
It looks at how gender analysis is reconfiguring civil society in Latin America.
Women are increasingly occupying positions in government
and in other elected leadership positions in Latin America.
I think you'd find it interesting.
If it was to do with people in the villages rather than those in the public sphere, I would.
Okay.
What about Second Language Acquisition?
Do you think I'd find that useful?
Well, you've had some practical experience in the field, I think it would be.
I hadn't thought about that.
I'll put that down as a definite, then.
Okay.
What about indigenous Women's Lives.
That sounds appropriate.
I thought so too, but I looked at last year's exam questions and that changed my mind.
Don't judge the value of the course on that.
Maybe talk to some other students first and we can talk about it again later.
Okay.
Yes, and lastly, will you sign up for Portuguese lessons?
My Spanish is good, so would I find that module easy?
Not necessarily.
Some people find that Spanish interferes with learning Portuguese‚Ä¶
getting the accent right too.
It's quite different in a lot of ways.
Well, I'd much sooner do something else, then.
Alright.
Now, what we need to do...

1177,Cam8 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam8---test-3---part-4,72,"Good morning, everyone.
In the last few lectures, I've been dealing with business finance,
but now I'm going to move on to business systems.
And in today's lecture,
I'm going to talk about what can go wrong when businesses try to copy their own best practices.
Once a business has successfully introduced a new process -
managing a branch bank, say, or selling a new product -
the parent organisation naturally wants to repeat that success,
and capture it if possible on a bigger scale.
The goal, then, is to utilise existing knowledge
and not to generate new knowledge.
It's a less glamorous activity than pure innovation,
but it actually happens more often, as a matter of fact.
However, surprisingly,
getting things right the second time is not necessarily any simpler than it was the first time.
Now, there's been a lot of research into how companies can repeat their previous successes,
and it certainly hasn't been confined to the United States.
It seems that most large industries are trying to repeat their own successes,
and manage the knowledge they've acquired -
but even so, it has been shown that the overwhelming majority of attempts fail.
A host of studies confirm this,
covering a wide range of business settings:
branch banks, retail stores, real estate agencies,
factories, call centres... to name but a few.
So why do so few managers get things right the second or third time?
Let's consider one reason for failure -
placing too much trust in the people who are running the successful operation,
the 'experts' shall we say.
Managers who want to apply existing knowledge typically start off by going to an expert -
such as the person who designed and is running a successful department store -
and picking their brains.
Now, this approach can be used if you want to gain a rough understanding of a particular system,
or understand smaller, isolated problems.
The trouble is, even the expert doesn't fully grasp the whole thing
because when it comes to complex systems,
the individual components of the process are interwoven with one another.
The expert never has complete access to the necessary information.
And the situation's complicated even further
by the fact that experts are usually not aware of their own ignorance.
The ignorance can take various forms.
For instance, a lot of details of the system are invisible to managers.
Some may be difficult to describe -
learned on the job and well known by workers perhaps,
but impossible to describe in a way that's helpful.
And there are some things that people know or do that they're not even aware of.
Now, let's consider two types of mistake
that can occur when a manager actually starts to set up a duplicate system to replicate a successful process.
Firstly, perhaps he forgets that he was just trying to copy another process,
and starts trying to improve on it.
Another mistake is trying to use the best parts of various different systems,
in the hope of creating the perfect combination.
Unfortunately, attempts like these usually turn out to be misguided and lead to problems.
Why?
Well, for various reasons.
Perhaps there weren't really any advantages after all,
because the information wasn't accurate.
Or perhaps the business settings weren't really comparable.
More typically, the advantages are real enough,
but there are also disadvantages that have been overlooked.
For example, the modifications might compromise safety in some way.
So, what's the solution?
Well, I don't intend to suggest that it's easy to get things right the second time...
it's not.
But the underlying problem has more to do with attitudes than the actual difficulty of the task,
and there are ways of getting it right.
These involve adjusting attitudes, first of all...
being more realistic and cautious really.
Secondly, they involve exerting strict controls on the organisational and operational systems.
And this, in turn, means copying the original as closely as possible.
Not merely duplicating the physical characteristics of the factory,
but also duplicating the skills that the original employees had.
Reliance on a template like this offers the huge advantage of built-in consistency.

Is that the one for temporary staff?
That's right.
Yes.
I'm afraid the person who's dealing with that isn't in today,
but I can give you the main details if you like.
Yes, please.
Could you tell me what kind of staff you are looking for?
We're looking for waiters at the moment.
There was one post for a cook, but that's already been taken.
Oh right.
What are the hours of work?
There are two different shifts -
there's a day shift from 7 to 2
and a late shift from 4 till 11.
And can people choose which one they want to do?
Not normally, because everyone would choose the day shift I suppose.
You alternate from one week to another.
Okay. I'm just writing all this down.
What about time off?
You get one day off
and I think you can negotiate which one you want,
it's more or less up to you.
But it has to be the same one every week.

You'd also get tips.
Our guests tend to be quite generous.
Erm, is there a uniform?
What about clothes?
Yes, I forgot to mention that.
You need to wear a white shirt, just a plain one,
and dark trousers.
You know, not green or anything like that.
And we don't supply those.
That's okay, I've got trousers,
I'd just have to buy a couple of shirts.
What about anything else?
Do I need a waistcoat or anything?
You have to wear a jacket, but the hotel lends you that.
I see.
One last thing - I don't know what the starting date is.
Just a minute, I think it's sometime around the end of June.
Yes, the 28th, in time for the summer.
That's great. I'm available from the 10th.
Oh good.
Well, if you can call again you need to speak to the Service Manager.
Her name's Jane Urwin,
that's URWIN,

1179,Cam8 - Test 4 - Part 2,B1,cam8---test-4---part-2,44,"Good morning and welcome again to Your City Today.
With me today is Graham Campbell, a councillor from the city council.
He'll be telling us about the plan to improve the fast-growing suburb of Red Hill.
Good morning Graham and welcome to the show.
Good morning, Carol.
Now, Graham, I understand that there has been a lot of community consultations for the new plan?
Yes, we've tried to address some of the concerns that local groups told us about.
People we've heard from are mainly worried about traffic in the area,
and, in particular, the increasing speed of cars near schools.
They feel that it is only a matter of time before there is an accident as a lot of the children walk to the school.
So we're trying to do something about that.
Another area of concern is the overhead power lines.
These are very old and a lot of people we spoke to asked if something could be done about them.
Well, I'm happy to report
the power company have agreed to move the power lines underground at a cost of $800,000.
I think that will really improve the look of the area, as well as being safer.
That's good to know,
but will that mean an increase in rates for the local businesses in that area?
Well, the power company have agreed to bear the cost of this themselves after a lot of discussion with the council.
This is wonderful news
as the council now has some extra funds for us to put into other things like tree planting and art work.
Now, we've also put together a map which we've sent out to all the residents in the area.
And on the map we've marked the proposed changes.
Firstly, we'll plant mature pine trees to provide shelter and shade just to the right of the supermarket in Days Road.
In order to address the traffic problems,
the pavements on the corner of Carberry and Thomas Street will be widened.
This will help to reduce the speed of vehicles entering Thomas Street.
We think it's very important to separate the local residential streets from the main road.
So the roadway at the entry to Thomas Street from Days Road will be painted red.
This should mark it more clearly and act as a signal for traffic to slow down.
One way of making sure that the pedestrians are safe is to increase signage at the intersections.
A 'keep clear' sign will be erected at the junction of Evelyn Street and Hill Street,
to enable traffic to exit at all times.
Something we're planning to do to help control the flow of traffic in the area
is to install traffic lights half way down Hill Street where it crosses Days Road.
Now, we haven't only thought about the cars and traffic, of course,
there's also something for the children.
We're going to get school children in the area to research a local story, the life of a local sports hero perhaps,
and an artist will incorporate that story into paintings on the wall of a building on the other side of Hill Street from the supermarket.
And finally, we've agreed to build a new children's playground
which will be at the other end of Hill Street, close to the intersection with Carberry Street.
Wonderful!
Now, what's the next stage?
Well, the final plan‚Ä¶

1180,Cam8 - Test 4 - Part 3,B1,cam8---test-4---part-3,99,"Hi Jeannie. How's it going?
Oh. Hello Dan.
Pretty well, thanks.
Have you managed to get the money for the course yet?
Yes, that's all sorted out now, thanks.
It took long enough, though.
It was practically a year ago that I applied to my local council for a grant,
and it took them six months to turn me down.
That's really slow.
And I thought I was eligible for government funding,
but it seems I was mistaken.
So then I asked the boss of the company I used to work for if they would sponsor me,
and much to my surprise, he said they'd make a contribution.
But what about college grants and scholarships?
There must be some you could apply for.
Yes, there are,
but they're all so small that I decided to leave them until I was desperate.
And in fact, I didn't need to apply.
My parents had been saying that as I already had a job, I ought to support myself through college.
But in the end, they took pity on me, so now I've just about got enough.
That's good.
So now I can put a bit of effort into meeting people.
Haven't had time so far.
Any suggestions?
What about joining some college clubs?
Oh right. You joined several, didn't you?
Yes, I'm in the drama club.
It's our first performance next week,
so we're rehearsing frantically, and I've got behind with my work,
but it's worth it.
I'm hoping to be in the spring production, too.
I've never liked acting.
Are you doing anything else?
I enjoyed singing when I was at school,
so I joined a group when I came to college.
I don't think the conductor stretches us enough, though
so I'll give up after the next concert.
And I also joined the debating society.
It's fun, but with all the rehearsing I'm doing, something has to go,
and I'm afraid that's the one.
Do you do any sports?
Yes, I'm in one of the hockey teams.
I'm not very good, but I'd really miss it if I stopped.
I decided to try tennis when I came to college,
and I'm finding it pretty tough going.
I'm simply not fit enough.
Nor me.
I think I'll give that a miss!
I'm hoping it'll help me to build up my stamina,
but it'll probably be a long haul.
Good luck.
Thanks.
How are you finding the course?
I wish we had more seminars.
What?
I'd have thought we had more than enough already.
All those people saying clever things that I could never think of -
it's quite interesting, but I wonder if I'm clever enough to be doing this course.
I find it helpful to listen to the other people.
I like the way we're exploring the subject,
and working towards getting insight into it.
How do you get on with your tutor?
I don't think I'm on the same wavelength as mine,
so I feel I'm not getting anything out of the tutorials.
It would be more productive to read a book instead.
Oh, mine's very demanding.
She gives me lots of feedback and advice,
so I've got much better at writing essays.
And she's helping me plan my revision for the end-of-year exams.
Do you tell me, I always struggle with revision.
Well, the first thing is to find out exactly what's required in the exams.
Would it help to get hold of some past papers?
Yes.
They'll help to make it clear.
Right, I'll do that.
Then what?
Then you can sort out your revision priorities,
based on what's most likely to come up.
I put these on a card, and read them through regularly.
But that isn't enough in itself.
You also need a timetable, to see how you can fit everything in, in the time available.
Then keep it in front of you while you're studying.
I've done that before, but it hasn't helped me!
Maybe you need to do something different every day,
so if you break down your revision into small tasks, and allocate them to specific days,
there's more incentive to tackle them.
With big topics you're more likely to put off starting.
Good idea.
And as I revise each topic
I write a single paragraph about it -
then later I can read it through quickly, and it helps fix things in my mind.
That's brilliant.
I also write answers to questions for the exam practice.
It's hard to make myself do it, though!
Well, I'll try.
Thanks a lot, Jeannie. That's a great help.
No problem.
See you around.
Bye.

1181,Cam8 - Test 4 - Part 4,B2,cam8---test-4---part-4,60,"Good morning, everyone.
I've been invited to talk about my research project into Australian Aboriginal rock paintings.
The Australian Aborigines have recorded both real and symbolic images of their time on rock walls for many thousands of years.
Throughout the long history of this tradition,
new images have appeared and new painting styles have developed.
And these characteristics can be used to categorise the different artistic styles.
Among these are what we call the Dynamic, Yam and Modern styles of painting.
One of the most significant characteristics of the different styles is the way that humans are depicted in the paintings.
The more recent paintings show people in static poses.
But the first human images to dominate rock art paintings, over 8,000 years ago, were full of movement.
These paintings showed people hunting and cooking food
and so they were given the name 'Dynamic' to reflect this energy.
It's quite amazing considering they were painted in such a simple stick-like form.
In the Yam period, there was a movement away from the stick figures to a more naturalistic shape.
However, they didn't go as far as the Modern style,
which is known as 'X-ray' because it actually makes a feature of the internal skeleton
as well as the organs of animals and humans.
The Yam style of painting got its name from the fact that it featured much curvier figures
that actually resemble the vegetable called a yam,
which is similar to a sweet potato.
The Modern paintings are interesting because they include paintings at the time of the first contact with European settlers.
Aborigines managed to convey the idea of the settlers' clothing by simply painting the Europeans without any hands,
indicating the habit of standing with their hands in their pockets!
Size is another characteristic.
The more recent images tend to be life size or even larger,
but the Dynamic figures are painted in miniature.
Aboriginal rock art also records the environmental changes that occurred over thousands of years.
For example, we know from the Dynamic paintings that over 8,000 years ago,
Aborigines would have rarely eaten fish
and sea levels were much lower at this time.
In fact, fish didn't start to appear in paintings until the Yam period
along with shells and other marine images.
The paintings of the Yam tradition also suggest that, during this time,
the Aborigines moved away from animals as their main food source
and began including vegetables in their diet, as these feature prominently.
Freshwater creatures didn't appear in the paintings until the Modern period from 4,000 years ago.
So, these paintings have already taught us a lot.
But one image that has always intrigued us is known as the 'Rainbow Serpent'.
The Rainbow Serpent, which is the focus of my most recent project,
gets its name from its snake or serpent-like body
and it first appeared in the Yam period 4 to 6,000 years ago.
Many believe it is a curious mixture of kangaroo, snake and crocodile.
But we decided to study the Rainbow Serpent paintings
to see if we could locate the animal that the very first painters based their image on.
The Yam period coincided with the end of the last ice age.
This brought about tremendous change in the environment,
with the sea levels rising and creeping steadily inland.
This flooded many familiar land features
and also caused a great deal of disruption to traditional patterns of life,
hunting in particular.
New shores were formed and totally different creatures would have washed up onto the shores.
We studied 107 paintings of the Rainbow Serpent
and found that the one creature that matches it most closely was the Ribboned Pipefish,
which is a type of sea horse.
This sea creature would have been a totally unfamiliar sight in the inland regions where the image is found
and may have been the inspiration behind the early paintings.
So, at the end of the ice age, there would have been enormous changes in animal and plant life.
It's not surprising then, that the Aborigines linked this abundance to the new creatures they witnessed.
Even today, Aborigines see the Rainbow Serpent as a symbol of creation,
which is understandable given the increase in vegetation and the new life forms that featured when the image first appeared.

1182,Cam7 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam7---test-1---part-1,95,"Hello, this is Land Transport Information at Toronto Airport.
How may I help you?
Oh, good morning.
I'm flying to Toronto Airport next week, and I need to get to a town called um, Milton.
Could you tell me how I can get there?
Milton, did you say?
Let me see.
I think that's about 150 miles southwest of here.
In fact, it's 147 miles to be exact,
so it'll take you at least - say, three to four hours by road.
Wow! Is it as far as that?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
But you have a number of options to get you there
and you can always rent a car right here at the airport, of course.
Right.
Well, I don't really want to drive myself, so...
I'd like more information about public transport.
OK.
In that case the quickest and most comfortable is a cab
and of course there are always plenty available.
But it'll cost you.
You can also take a Greyhound bus or there's an Airport Shuttle Service to Milton.
Uh, I think for that kind of distance a cab would be way beyond my budget.
But the bus sounds OK.
Can you tell me how much that would cost?
Sure.
Let's see, that would be $15 one way,
or 27.50 return...
that's on the Greyhound.
Oh, that's quite cheap - great!
Uh... but whereabouts does it stop in Milton?
It goes directly from the airport here to the City Centre, and it's pretty fast.
But you have to bear in mind that there is only one departure a day,
so it depends what time your flight gets in.
Oh, of course.
Hang on, we're due to get there at 11.30 am.
Hmmm, too bad,
the bus leaves at 3.45,
so you would have quite a wait - more than 4 hours.
Oh, I see.
Well, what about the shuttle you mentioned?
OK.
That's the Airport Shuttle that will take you from the airport right to your hotel or private address.
It's a door-to-door service and it would suit you much better, because there's one every two hours.
So how much does that cost?
Let's see.
Yeah, that's $35 one way, $65 return,
so I guess it's a bit more expensive than the Greyhound.
Oh, that doesn't sound too bad,
especially if it'll take me straight to the hotel.
But you do need to reserve a seat.
OK,
is it possible to make a booking right now? Through you?
Sure.
OK, I just have to fill this form out for you.
So what date do you want to book this for?
The 16th of October.
Oh, oh, no, sorry, that's my departure date.
I arrive on the 17th, so book it for then, please.
So, that's the Toronto Airport Shuttle to Milton.
And this is for just one person or‚Ä¶?
Yeah, just me, please.
Right.
And you said your expected time of arrival was 11.30?
So if I book your Shuttle for after 12.00 - let's say 12.30,
that should give you plenty of time to, you know, collect your baggage, maybe grab a coffee?
Yeah, that sounds fine, as long as we land on time!
Well, we'll take your flight details so you don't need to worry too much about that.
Now, what about the fare?
What sort of ticket do you want?
One way or‚Ä¶?
Yeah, that'll be fine, provided I can book the return trip once I'm there.
No problem - just allow a couple of days in advance to make sure you get a seat.
And what is your name, please?
Janet, Janet Thomson.
Is that Thompson spelt with a 'p'?
No, it's THOMSON.
OK.
And you'll be coming from the UK?
What flight will you be traveling on?
Oh, it's Air Canada flight number AC936, from London Heathrow.
Right.
Now, do you know where you'll be staying?
We need to give the driver an address.
Yes, it's called the Vacation Motel
and I think it's near the town centre.
Anyway, the address is 24, Kitchener Street -
that's KITCHENER Street.
That's fine.
Right, so that's $35 to pay, please. Have you got your credit card number there?
Yes, it's a VISA card,
and the number is 3303 8450 2045 6837.
OK. Well, that seems to be everything.
Have a good trip and we'll see you in Toronto next week!
Yes, bye. Oh, thanks for your help!

1183,Cam7 - Test 1 - Part 2,B2,cam7---test-1---part-2,61,"Thank you all for coming to my talk this evening.
It's nice to see so many people in the audience.
For those of you who don't know very much about PS Camping,
let me start by giving you some background information about the company.
The company started 25 years ago.
It actually opened as a retail chain selling camping equipment,
and then 20 years ago, it bought a small number of campsites in the UK,
and began offering camping holidays.
The company grew rapidly
and has been providing holidays in continental Europe for the last 15 years.
If you book a camping holiday with us,
you'll have a choice of over 300 sites.
In Italy, we now have some 64 sites that we either own, or have exclusive use of.
France is where we have the majority of sites,
and we currently have a project to expand into Switzerland.
We also have a number of sites in Northern Spain,
particularly in the mountainous region of Picos de Europa.
We've upgraded all these Spanish sites,
and improved them considerably from their original three-star rating.
We believe our holidays offer superb facilities for the whole family.
Parents who want their children to be fully occupied for all or part of the day
can take advantage of our children's activities.
These are organised by our well-qualified and enthusiastic staff.
Each day kicks off with a sports match, perhaps football, or volleyball,
followed by an hour of drama for everyone.
This may include singing or dancing, mime or other activities.
In the afternoon, there's a different art activity for each day of the week
including a poster competition or model making.
What's more, our sites are truly child-friendly,
and, with this in mind, we operate a no-noise rule in the evenings.
Children's evening activities usually finish at 9.30, or occasionally 10,
and from 10.30 holiday-makers are expected to be quiet in the areas where there are tents.
We want nothing to go wrong on a PS Camping holiday,
but if it does, we also want all our customers to be insured.
If you haven't organised an annual insurance policy of your own
you'll need to take out the low-cost cover we offer
and we require that you arrange this when you make your holiday reservation.
There are many advantages to choosing PS Camping, and to recommending it to others.
As a regular customer, you'll be kept informed of special offers,
and your friends can benefit from 10% off their holiday,
or book a luxury tent for the price of a standard one.
In return, we'll send you a thank-you present,
which you can choose from a list of high-quality items.
When it comes to our tents, these are equipped to the highest standard.
We really do think of every essential detail,
from an oven and cooking rings fuelled by bottled gas,
to mirrors in the bedroom areas.
If you don't want to cook indoors,
you can borrow a barbecue if you ask in advance for one to be made available,
and there's even a picnic blanket to sit on outside your tent.
Inside, a box of games and toys can be found,
and children's tents can be hired if required.
All tents have a fridge,
and if you want to spend the day on the beach, for example,
ask for a specially designed PS Camping cool box,
which will keep your food and drinks chilled.
There are excellent washing facilities at all our sites,
with washing machines and clothes lines in the central areas,
along with mops and buckets in case your tent needs cleaning during your stay.
All sites have a cafe and/or a shop
for those who'd rather 'eat in' than dine at a local restaurant.

1184,Cam7 - Test 1 - Part 3,C1,cam7---test-1---part-3,77,"Well, you've both been looking at different styles of managing individuals in companies and the workplace.
How's the research going, Philip?
Well, I've been looking at why individualism...
I mean individual differences, are such an important area of management studies.
When you think about any organization,
be it a family business or a multinational company,
they're all fundamentally a group of people working together.
But it's what these individuals contribute to their places of work that makes you realize how important they are.
Of course they bring different ideas,
but it's also their attitudes and their experiences of learning.
Diversity is important in these areas too.
So why do people behave so differently from one another at work?
There are lots of reasons
but research has shown that a lot of it comes down to personality.
And the other factor is gender.
It's a well known fact that men and women do lots of things in different ways,
and the workplace is no different.
Did you look at the effects of this variation on companies?
Yes, I did.
On the positive side,
exposure to such diversity helps encourage creativity
which is generally an asset to a company.
But unfortunately individual differences are also the root of conflict between staff
and they can lead to difficulties for management, which can sometimes be serious.
Thanks, Philip.
So, now, I guess the two main things to remember here are to identify individual talent and then to utilize it.
So, Janice, you were looking at identifying different talents in workers.
Do you think this is easy for managers to do?
Well, currently teamwork is in fashion in the workplace
and in my opinion the importance of the individual is generally neglected.
What managers should be targeting is those employees who can take the lead in a situation
and are not afraid to accept the idea of responsibility.
That's true Janice but...
unfortunately, many managers think the entire notion of encouraging individuality amongst their staff is far too hard.
Yes, that may be true
but I think one of the most important tasks of managers is to consider the needs of the individual on one hand
and group co-operation and conformity on the other.
It requires creative thinking on the part of management to avoid tension.
So Janice, what kind of people do you think companies should be looking for?
Well, it has to start from the very beginning
when companies are looking for new employees.
When the personnel department is choosing between applicants
they need to look for someone who's broken the mould and can think for themselves.
Instead, people making these decisions often use a range of psychological tests
to see if a person is a problem solver, or will do as they're told.
I'm not convinced these qualities are actually the most important.
So, do you think being a good team player is overrated?
No, it's not overrated.
You do need to learn the rules and learn them fast.
No individual can get around this if you're working in an organization.
So how should managers deal with this?
Rewards.
When an individual demonstrates the behaviour the organisation expects,
some kind of incentive can be given.
What's important here is that this happens right at the beginning
so new recruits learn the rules of the system immediately.
Also the incentive should be something the individual actually wants,
and this isn't always just money.
To come back to you, Philip.
You were saying that recognition of good performers is essential.
What else should managers be looking for?
Well, managing people means you not only have an understanding of your employees,
but you also recognise the culture of the organization.
In fact, for some organizations, creativity and individuality may be the last thing they want to see during working hours!
Very true.
Yes, but managing people isn't as easy as it looks.
For example, change in the workplace can be quite tricky,
especially if there's a need to increase profit.
And at times like these,
managers may have to give priority to profit rather than individual staff needs.
Yes, and that creates difficult situations for people.
Yes but what's important is that managers are able to deal with quite high levels of personal stress.
During times of change,
they should be thinking not only about the strain on their staff
but take time out to think of themselves.
Absolutely.
So what are the implications‚Ä¶

1185,Cam7 - Test 1 - Part 4,B2,cam7---test-1---part-4,69,"Good afternoon, everyone!
This is the first seminar in preparation for our archaeological fieldwork in Namibia;
we are fantastically lucky to have received partial research funding for this trip from our Institute,
so I shall expect 200% attention and participation from you all.
First in this seminar, I'm going to give a brief introduction to contemporary research on rock art,
and in the second part I'm going to give you some do's and don'ts for our fieldwork trip in April -
so please listen very carefully.
I'm first going to focus on the interpretation of rock art in Namibia.
We are very fortunate to be going to an area where you can find some of the most important sites in the entire world.
And I hope to show you how easy it is for everyone to make mistakes in looking at cultures which are different from our own -
the first and most important lesson we have to learn.
In Namibia, there are both paintings and engravings -
that's where the surface of the rock is cut out.
Many of the engravings show footprints of animals
and most scholars used to think that the purpose of these was simple and obvious:
this rock art was like a school book with pictures to teach children about tracks -
which track belonged to which animal - giraffe, lion and so on.
But there were some mysteries.
First, when you look at a typical Namibian painting or engraving,
you see the tracks are repeated, there are dozens of tracks for the same animal.
You'd expect just one clear illustration if the reason... the aim was to teach tracking.
Now, there were two more problems.
Why are some of the engravings of animals very accurate as you'd expect - all clearly identifiable,
and others quite unrealistic?
And another mystery:
some of these unrealistic animals that's in the engravings seem to be half human.
Some, for example, have got human faces.
Many researchers now think that these were pictures the wise men engraved of themselves.
They believed they could use magic to control the animals they had drawn,
so the hunters could then catch them for food.
This shows you some of the dangers of coming from one culture to another,
as we'll be doing, without understanding it fully.
Scholars imagined that children looked at rock art pictures to learn to track
just because they themselves had learnt skills from pictures;
many researchers now believe that rock art had a much more complex purpose.
And we'll talk more about it next week!
Now, before I invite you to join in a discussion in this second part of the seminar,
I'd like to make some very important points about our fieldwork
and in fact, any field trip to look at rock art.
We're going to a number of sites, and we won't always be together.
The single largest problem faced by people who manage the sites is...
yes, I'm sure you've guessed - damage caused by visitors,
even though it's usually unintentional.
Whenever you do go to a site,
don't forget you can learn many things from observing at a distance instead of walking all over it.
This can really help to reduce visitor pressure.
People often say, 'Well, there's only two of us and just this one time',
but maybe thousands of people are saying the same thing.
And then some basic rules to guide you:
we'll have our own camp near a village,
but remember, never to camp on a site if you go on your own.
It may be disrespectful to the people of that culture,
and certainly don't make fires, however romantic it may seem.
It's really dangerous in dry areas,
and you can easily burn priceless undiscovered material by doing so.
So, how are we going to enjoy the rock art on our field trip?
By looking at it, drawing it and photographing it,
never by touching it or even tracing it.
Rock art is fragile and precious.
Remember that climbing on rocks and in caves can destroy in a moment what has lasted for centuries.
So no heroics in Namibia, please!
Try to be extra careful and help others to be too.
And lastly, please don't even move rocks or branches to take photographs.
You should leave the site intact.
I'm sure I can rely on you to do that.
Well, that's about all I want to say before today's first discussion,
but if you have any questions, please ask them now
oh, and, don't forget you'll find some fascinating information about world-wide sites on the Internet.
Right, first question then?

Mr Jones‚Ä¶ I'm getting a couple of quotes coming up on the computer now‚Ä¶
and the best bet looks like being with a company called Red Flag.
Yeah.
And that comes out at $450 per year‚Ä¶
That seems okay.
It's quite a bit lower than I've been paying up to now.
Great.
So, would you like me to go ahead with that?
Sure‚Ä¶ why not?
How would you like to pay?

1187,Cam7 - Test 2 - Part 2,B1,cam7---test-2---part-2,41,"Thank you for calling the Tourist Line.
There are many different ways of getting round the city
and we'd like to suggest some you may not have thought of.
How about a city trip by boat?
There are four main stopping points - from west to east:
stop A: Green Banks,
stop B: City Bridge,
stop C: Roman Landing
and stop D: Newtown.
You can find the main booking office at stop A.
The first boat leaves at 8 a.m.
and the last one at 6.30 p.m.
There are also many attractions you can visit along the river.
At Stop A, if you have time,
you can visit the fine 16th century palace here
built for the king with its beautiful formal gardens.
It's very near the booking office.
Now, you can enjoy every corner of this superb residence.
Stop B - Why don't you visit Tower Restaurant with its wide range of refreshments?
This is a place where you can sit and enjoy the wonderful views over the old commercial and banking centre of the city.
Stop C is the area where, in the first century AD, invading soldiers crossed the river;
this was much shallower than it is now.
That's why this area is called Roman Landing.
There's an interactive museum to visit here
with a large shop which has a good range of local history books.
At the furthest point of the trip, stop D,
the most exciting place to visit is the new Entertainment Complex
with seven-screen cinema, bowling alley and video games arcade.
Besides the boat tours, there are city buses.
Two companies offer special services:
The Top Bus Company runs all its tours with a live commentary in English.
Tours leave from 8.30 a.m. every 20 minutes.
There are departures from Central Station, Castle Hill and Long Walk.
This is a hop-on hop-off service
and tickets are valid for 24 hours.
For further details call Top Bus on...
02089447810.
The Number One Sightseeing Tour is available with a commentary in eight languages.
Buses depart from Central Station every five to six minutes from about 9 a.m.
with the last bus at around 7 p.m.
There are also Number One services with an English-speaking‚Ä¶

1188,Cam7 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam7---test-2---part-3,76,"We're pleased to welcome Dr Martin Merrywhether of the Antarctic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand
who has come along to talk to us today about the role of the Centre and the Antarctic Treaty.
Now my first question is about the choice of location for the centre.
Why Christchurch? Was it because of the climate?
Well, actually, New Zealand is the second closest country to Antarctica
and Christchurch is often used on Antarctic expeditions.
Right, so it's because of where we are‚Ä¶ coupled with our historical role.
So tell us - what is the main purpose of the centre?
Oh well‚Ä¶ we have two complementary roles.
One is as a scientific base for expeditions and research
and the other is as an information centre.
Tell us something about the role as a scientific base.
We're able to provide information about what scientists should take with them to the South Pole -
for example, the centre contains a clothing warehouse
where expeditions are supplied with suitable clothing for the extreme conditions.
I suppose you need a bit more than your normal winter coat!
Yes, exactly
and then there's also the specialist library and mapping services.
Right.
And which countries are actually located at the centre?
Well‚Ä¶ the centre houses research programmes for New Zealand,
for The United States as well as for Italy‚Ä¶
there's even a US post office at the American airforce base here.
Really?
And what does the visitor's centre offer?
Well, since very few people will ever experience the Antarctic first hand,
the visitors' centre aims to recreate the atmosphere of Antarctica.
There's a mock camp site where you can see inside an Antarctic tent and imagine yourself sleeping there.
And the centre also acts as a showcase for the unique international co-operation
which exists in Antarctica today.
What is it actually like at the South Pole?
I know you've been there on a number of occasions.
Yes, I have and each time I'm struck by the awesome beauty of the place.
It's magnificent
but you can really only visit it in the summer months.
October to March.
Yes, because it's completely dark for four months of the year‚Ä¶
and, in addition, it has to be the coldest place on earth.
Colder than the North Pole?
Why's that?
Well, unlike the North Pole, which is actually a frozen sea,
Antarctica is a land mass shaped like a dome,
with the result that the winds blow down the slopes at speeds of up to 150 km an hour
and that's what makes it so cold.
And one other interesting thing is that Antarctica is the driest continent on earth,
surprisingly, and so you have to drink large amounts of water when you're there.
How old is Antarctica?
Oh, we're pretty sure it was part of a larger land mass but it broke away from the rest of the continent...
170 million years ago.
How can you be certain of this?
Because fossils and rocks have been discovered in Antarctica
which are the same as those found in places such as Africa and Australia.
Amazing‚Ä¶ to think that it was once attached to Africa‚Ä¶
Now let's just have a look at the Antarctic Treaty.
How far back does the idea of an international treaty go?
Well, as far back as the 19th century,
when 11 nations organised an international event.
When was that exactly?
In 1870.
And it was called the Polar Research Meeting.
And then, not long after that,
they organised something called the First International Polar Year.
And that took place when exactly?
Over two years from 1882 to 1883.
But it wasn't until the 1950s that the idea of an international treaty was proposed.
And in 1959, the Treaty was actually signed.
What do you see as the main achievements of the treaty?
Well, firstly, it means that the continent is reserved for peaceful use.
That's Article 1, isn't it?
Yes‚Ä¶
That's important since the territory belongs to everyone.
Yes but not as important as Article 5,
which prohibits any nuclear explosions or waste disposal.
Which is marvellous.
Well, I'm afraid we're going to have to stop there because I'm afraid we've run out of time.
Thanks for coming along today and telling us all about the centre and its work.

1189,Cam7 - Test 2 - Part 4,C1,cam7---test-2---part-4,63,"My topic is handedness -
whether in different sports it is better to be left or right-sided
or whether a more balanced approach is more successful.
I'm left-handed myself
and I actually didn't see any relevance to my own life
when I happened to start reading an article by a sports psychologist called Peter Matthews.
He spent the first part of the article talking about handedness in music instead of sport,
which I have to say almost put me off from reading further.
But what I soon became struck by
was the sheer volume of both observation and investigation he had done in many different sports
and I felt persuaded that what he had to say would be of real interest.
I think Matthews' findings will be beneficial,
not so much in helping sportspeople to work on their weaker side,
but more that they can help them identify the most suitable strategies to use in a given game.
Although most trainers know how important handedness is,
at present they are rather reluctant to make use of the insights scientists like Matthews can give,
which I think is rather short-sighted
because focusing on individual flexibility is only part of the story.
Anyway, back to the article.
Matthews found a German study which looked at what he called 'mixed-handedness',
that is, the capacity to use both left and right hands equally.
It looked at mixed-handedness in 40 musicians on a variety of instruments.
Researchers examined a number of variables,
for example, type of instrument played,
regularity of practice undertaken
and length of time playing instrument‚Ä¶
and found the following:
keyboard players had high levels of mixed-handedness,
whereas string players like cellists and violinists strongly favoured one hand.
Also, those who started younger were more mixed-handed.
Matthews also reports studies of handedness in apes.
Apes get a large proportion of their food by 'fishing' ants from ant hills.
The studies show that apes, like humans, show handedness -
though, for them right and left-handedness is about equal,
whereas about 85% of humans are right-handed.
Studies showed that apes consistently using the same hand
fished out 30% more ants than those varying between the two.
Matthews started researching several different sports
and found different types of handedness in each.
By the way, he uses 'handedness'.
to refer to the dominant side for feet and eyes as well as hands.
Anyway, his team measured the hand, feet and eyes of 2,611 players
and found that there were really three main types of laterality:
mixed - you work equally well on both sides - both hand and eye;
single - you tend to favour one side but both hand and eye favour the same side;
and cross-laterality - a player's hands and eyes favour only one side
but they are opposite sides.
Let's start with hockey.
Matthews found that it was best to be mixed-handed -
this is because a hockey stick must be deployed in two directions -
it would be a drawback to have hand or eye favouring one side.
An interesting finding is that mixed-handed hockey players were significantly more confident than their single-handed counterparts.
Things are slightly different in racket sports like tennis.
Here the important thing is to have the dominant hand and eye on the one side.
This means that there is a bigger area of vision on the side where most of the action occurs.
If a player is cross lateral,
the racket is invisible from the dominant eye for much of the swing.
It means that they can only make corrections much later‚Ä¶
and often the damage has been done by then.
And moving to a rather different type of sport which involves large but precise movements - gymnastics.
It's been found that cross hand-eye favouring is best.
The predominant reason for this is because it aids balance,
which is of course absolutely central to performance in this sport.

Oh, good morning.
Is this‚Ä¶ er‚Ä¶ er‚Ä¶ room number 26?
Yes, that's right.
So, is this the Student Job Centre?
It certainly is.
How can I help you?
Well, actually I'm looking for a job - a part-time job.
Do you have anything available at the moment?
Ah, yes‚Ä¶ Are you a registered student?
I'm afraid this service is only available to full-time students.
Yes‚Ä¶ I am.
I'm doing a degree in Business Studies.
Here's my student card.
Which year are you in?
Well‚Ä¶ I've been at uni for four years but...
I'm in the third year because I took last year off.

that's Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.
That sounds like fun but...
unfortunately I have evening lectures - so that's not possible, I'm afraid.
Is there anything during the day?
OK, that's no good then.
Um... What about cleaning?
There's a position for a cleaner at the Child Care Centre.
But you'd need to be there at 6 am.
Does that appeal?
Six o'clock in the morning!
Oh, that's far too early for me, I'm afraid...
I'd never make it that early in the morning.
Well, there was a position going in the Computer Lab for three days a week that might be okay.
Ah, here it is!
No, it's in the library, not the lab,
Ah... Clerical Assistant required -
I think it mostly involves putting the books back on the shelves.
Oh no, hang on.
It's for Wednesday and Friday evenings again.
No, I can't manage that because of the lectures.
OK, I'm getting the idea.
Ah... look, I'll just get a few details from you anyway,
and then we can check through the list and see what comes up.
We'll fill in the personal details on this application form first, if that's okay?
Yes, that's fine.

Room B569.
Er... No, sorry, B659.
I always get that wrong. I haven't been living there very long.
Do you have any other skills?
Typing, languages, that sort of thing?
Well, I speak some Japanese.
Right, I'll make a note of that.

Mmm... I was hoping to have Saturdays free.
But I need the work so‚Ä¶
can you tell me what the job involves?
Yup, sure.
It says here that you'll be required to deal with student enquiries and answer the phone.
Oh, I'm sure I can handle all that without a problem.
Great.
Well, would you like me to arrange an interview for you?
Say, Friday morning, around ten?
Oh... Ah... Could we make it a bit later?

1191,Cam7 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam7---test-3---part-2,68,"Good morning.
I'm very pleased to have been invited along to your club to talk about our Charity Sponsored Walking Holiday for Education Aid.
I'll start by giving you a brief overview of what it entails.
First of all, let me explain what we mean by 'sponsored' here.
This is where people promise to donate money to the charity if you achieve your goal,
in this case, to walk a certain number of miles.
Basically we are organizing a ten-day holiday,
from the sixth to the sixteenth of November,
with eight days actual walking, trekking in the Semira Mountains.
Let's have a look at some of the details.
We require you to raise sponsorship money of at least $3,200,
paying $250 of it upfront as a deposit
and the rest in stages throughout the year.
Out of this about thirty-five percent will go on your expenses,
and that leaves sixty-five percent guaranteed to go to the charity.
Which brings me to the most important part.
This trek is being specifically organized to help education in the Semira region.
Last year we helped train teachers for the disabled,
and this year we're focusing on the pupils.
Each of the walkers' sponsorship money will go to help an individual special needs pupil in one of the mountain schools.
In the second part of the talk, I'll be giving you a lot more details,
but back to the basic information.
Age limits.
This is the second time we have run this kind of holiday and...
on the first we even had an eighty-year old,
but we found it was wise to establish limits this time.
You have to be at least eighteen and the top limit is now seventy,
though you need to obtain a health certificate from your doctor if you are over sixty years old.
Now, the Semira Mountains are among the highest in the world
but you mustn't be too daunted,
we will mainly be trekking in the foothills only,
although there will be spectacular views even in the foothills.
However, you will need to be extremely fit
if you aren't now and you're interested in coming with us.
You have plenty of time to get into shape.
You will be sleeping in tents so you must have quite a bit of equipment with you
but you will be helped by local assistants.
Your bedding and so forth will be carried by them.
We ask that you only walk with a small rucksack with needs for the day.
I don't think I've really said enough about the marvelous area you'll be walking in.
Let's have a look at some of the sights you'll be seeing.
Apart from these spectacular snow-covered peaks and valleys,
there are marvelous historic villages.
The area has been famous for centuries for making beautiful carpets,
although recently there has been a trend to move into weaving blankets and wood carving.
The people are extremely friendly and welcoming.
We deliberately keep the parties small in size to minimize disruption to people and landscape.
I hope that there are still some people interested.
I will be distributing leaflets at the end where you can find out more information,
but just for the moment I'll outline the itinerary,
the main high points of the holiday.
Obviously, you'll start by flying out to Kishba, the capital city, on Day One.
After a couple of days to acclimatize yourself,
you'll start the trek on Day Three walking through the enormous Katiba Forest
which will take the whole of the day.
Day Four takes us higher up, going through the foothills past a number of villages
and visiting a school for the disabled in Sohan.
Then you have a rest day, that's Day Five,
before going to the spectacular Kumi Temple
with twelfth-century carvings, set in a small forest by a lake
and that's Day Six, the highlight for many.
We stay near there for Day Seven because then comes the hardest day,
walking through very mountainous country,
but culminating in a swim in the Parteh Falls.
This is the highest waterfall in the region.
Day Nine is much easier, with part of the day spent in a village where they make some of the gorgeous red blankets.
Then back down to Kishba and the journey home.
So, you can see it's a pretty packed timetable‚Ä¶

1192,Cam7 - Test 3 - Part 3,B2,cam7---test-3---part-3,64,"Thanks to all of you for coming along today to hear about how the robotic float project is helping with ocean research.
Well, first of all, we'll look at what a robotic float does and its use.
So let's start with the device itself.
It looks a bit like a cigar and it's about one and a half meters long.
More importantly, it's full of equipment that's designed to collect data.
So, it can help us in building up a profile of different factors
which work together within the world's oceans.
Sounds like a big project - isn't it too big for one country to undertake?
That's quite true but this project is a really good example of international co-operation.
Over the last five years, scientists from thirteen countries have been taking part in the project
and launching floats in their area of ocean control.
And next year this number will rise to fourteen when Indonesia joins the project.
That's impressive.
But let's move onto how floats work.
The operational cycle goes like this.
Each of the floats is dropped in the ocean from a boat at a set point and activated from a satellite.
Then the float immediately sinks about 2,000 meters‚Ä¶
that's two whole kilometers down in the water.
It stays at this depth for about 10 days
and is carried around by the currents which operate in the ocean at this level.
During this time it's possible for it to cover quite large distances
but the average is fifty kilometers.
So, what is it actually recording?
Well, at this stage, nothing,
but as it rises to the surface, it collects all sorts of data,
most importantly variations in salinity,
that's salt levels, and the changes in temperature,
a bit like underwater weather balloons.
Then, when it gets back to the surface all the data it's collected is beamed up to the satellite.
After about five hours on the surface,
the float automatically sinks, beginning the whole process again.
What happens to the data?
Well the information is transferred direct to onshore meteorological stations‚Ä¶
like our one in Hobart‚Ä¶
and within four hours the findings can be on computers
and they can be mapped and analysed.
You say you're building models of the world's ocean systems but...
how're they going to be used, and more importantly, when?
Some of the data has already helped in completing projects.
For example, our understanding of the underlying causes of El Nino events is being confirmed by float data.
Another way we're using float data is to help us to understand the mechanics of climate change,
like global warming and ozone depletion.
That's part of an ongoing variability study but the results are still a long way off.
However, this is not the case with our ocean weather forecasting.
Because we know from the floats what the prevailing weather conditions will be in certain parts of the ocean,
we can advise the navy on search and rescue missions.
That's happening right now
and many yachtsmen owe their lives to the success of this project.
In addition, the float data can help us to look at the biological implications of ocean processes.
Would that help with preserving fish stocks?
Yes, and advising governments on fisheries legislation.
We're well on the way to completing a project on this.
We hope it will help to bring about more sustainable fishing practices.
We'll be seeing the results of that quite soon.
It sounds like the data from floats has lots of applications.
Yes it does.
It's also a powerful agricultural tool.
If we were aware of what the weather would be like, say, next year,
we could make sure that the farmers planted appropriate grain varieties to produce the best yield from the available rainfall.
That sounds a bit like science fiction,
especially when now we can't even tell them when a drought will break.
I agree that this concept is still a long way in the future,
but it will come eventually
and the float data will have made a contribution.

1193,Cam7 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam7---test-3---part-4,56,"Good morning everyone.
Today's lecture forms part of the Hospitality and Tourism module.
Last week I looked at the economy end of the hotel business;
this week I'm going to discuss the luxury end of the market.
Let's consider the following scenario‚Ä¶
You wake up in the middle of the night in a strange hotel miles away from home,
disoriented most probably from jet lag,
when even the most expensive surroundings can seem empty and dispiriting.
You have paid a great deal of money to stay in this first-class hotel with its contemporary technology,
but according to recent research carried out by an international travel and public relations company,
all is not well.
The research suggests that even the most opulent, luxurious hotels seem to have underestimated the most basic needs of their customers -
be they travelling for work or pleasure:
the need to feel at home in surroundings which are both familiar and inviting.
Do these findings, however, apply only to hotels situated in particular areas?
Is it possible that the external environment can affect a guest's well-being?
The company's research covered a whole range of different hotel types,
both independent hotels and those which are part of large chains.
They investigated chic so-called boutique hotels in the heart of downtown business districts,
stately mansions located in the depths of beautiful countryside,
and plush hotels built at the edge of tropical beaches surrounded by palm trees and idyllic blue ocean.
And the research concluded that what was outside the hotel building simply didn't matter.
This is a fascinating revelation
and those of you hoping to move into careers in the travel and leisure industry
would be well advised to look at the findings in more detail.
But back to the main point of this lecture‚Ä¶ the need to feel at home.
What can the hotel industry do about it?
And is the very idea so subjective that it's impossible to do anything about it on a global basis?
However, nothing stands still in this world.
One company has come up with the slogan 'Take Your Home With You',
and aims to provide clients with luxury serviced apartments.
Those in the business travel industry maintain that these serviced apartments
dispense with all the unwanted and expensive hotel services that business travellers don't want,
while maximising the facilities they do want.
For example, not only sleeping and living accommodation,
but also a sleek modern kitchen
that allows guests to cook and entertain if they wish,
at no additional cost.
The attractions of such facilities are obvious
and it'll be interesting to see whether the company manages to establish a trend all over the world
and make a lasting impact on the luxury accommodation market.
Now, finally I want to consider the psychology underpinning the traditional holiday hotel industry.
As a hotelier, how do you go about attracting people to give up the security of their own home
and entrust themselves to staying in a completely strange place
and sleeping in an unfamiliar bed?
Firstly, hotels exploit people's need to escape the predictability of their everyday lives.
For a few days people can pretend they are free of responsibilities
and can indulge themselves.
Secondly, there is something very powerful in our need to be pampered and looked after,
it's almost as if we return to being a baby,
when everything was done for us and we felt safe and secure.
And not far removed from this is the pleasure in being spoilt and given little treats -
like the miniscule bottles of shampoo and tiny bars of soap,
the chocolate on your pillow at night -
and we actually forget that we are paying for it all!
Next week, I'm going to look at eco-hotels, a fairly new phenomenon but increasingly popular‚Ä¶

1195,Cam7 - Test 4 - Part 2,B1,cam7---test-4---part-2,61,"Welcome to all of you.
Can everybody see and hear me?
Good. I'm Sally, your guide for this tour of the Bicentennial Park.
I hope that you're all wearing your most comfortable shoes and that you can keep up the pace.
So let's get under way on our tour around this wonderful park.
I'll start today with some general background information.
There used to be a lot of factories in this area until the 1960s.
Creating the park required the demolition of lots of derelict buildings on the site,
so most of the exciting park space all around you was originally warehouses and storehouses.
The idea of building a public park here
was first discussed when a property developer proposed a high-rise housing development,
but the local community wasn't happy.
If the land was to be cleaned up,
they wanted to use the site for recreation.
Residents wanted open space for outdoor activities,
rather than housing or even an indoor sports complex.
Now, to the Bicentennial Park itself.
It has two areas,
a nature reserve and a formal park with man-made features and gardens.
The tall blue-and-white building in front of us is called The Tower
and is the centre point for the formal gardens.
It stands twelve metres high,
so, follow me up the stairs to where we can take advantage of the fantastic views.
Well, here we are at the top of The Tower,
and we're going to look at the view from each direction.
Out to the east, the large buildings about a kilometre away are on the Olympic site.
There's an indoor arena for gymnastics,
a stadium for track and field
and a swimming pool for races and synchronised swimming and also diving.
If you look carefully down there,
you can see the train lines.
The Olympic site has its own station to encourage the use of public transport.
There is also a car park, but it only holds a limited number of cars.
The formal park has some specially-created water features.
If you look out here to the south, you can see a circular ornamental pond.
And around to the west,
you can relax and sit on a bench to smell the flowers in the rose garden,
and finally up to the north, if you look in front of you now,
there's a lake with a small island in the centre,
you can hire rowing boats at the boat shed, which you can't see from here,
but if you look through the trees, you can see the caf√©,
which has lovely views across the water.
Okay, let's climb down now.
We will go now and have a look at the nature reserve section of the park,
which has opened up natural wetland to the public.
The Mangroves have been made more accessible to visitors by the boardwalk built during the park's upgrade.
You'd think that people would come here to look at the unusual plant life of the area,
but in fact, it's more often used for cycling and is very popular with the local clubs.
This is the far end of the park
and over there you can see the Frog Pond,
a natural feature here long before the park was designed.
Just next to it we have our outdoor classroom,
a favourite spot for school parties.
The area is now most often used by primary schools for biology lessons.
And finally let's pass by the Waterbird Refuge.
This area is in a sheltered part of the estuary,
that's why the park's viewing shelter is a favourite spot for bird watchers who can use it to spy through binoculars.
You can watch a variety of water birds,
but most visitors expect to see black swans when they come to the shelter.
You might spot one yourself right now!
Well, here we are back at our starting point...

1196,Cam7 - Test 4 - Part 3,B1,cam7---test-4---part-3,65,"Remind me, Trevor, how long is the presentation?
Dr White said three per hour.
So about twenty minutes?
Well‚Ä¶ it'll be fifteen minutes per presentation.
And five minutes for questions.
And is this one going to be assessed?
No, not this time round
because it's the first one‚Ä¶ you know.
Oh, good news.
Well, Trevor, what are we going to include?
Well, do you think we ought to give some historical background?
Oh no, definitely not, we won't have time!
OK‚Ä¶
but I think we ought to say something about the geographical location
cos not a lot of people know where the islands are.
Yes, okay‚Ä¶
I'll take notes, shall I?
Yeah, that'll be a help.
So, geographical location‚Ä¶
Then we ought to give an overview of the whole education system.
Shouldn't we say something about the economy,
you know agricultural produce, minerals and so forth?
Well, Dr White said we shouldn't go into that sort of detail.
But it's pretty important when you think about it,
you know, because it does influence the education system.
Look, let's think about that one later shall we?
Let's see how we're doing for time.
Okay, so‚Ä¶ general overview of education.
Of course‚Ä¶ and then the role of English language.
Hmm... Nope, that goes in the Language Policy Seminar, don't you remember?
Are you sure?
Positive.
Alright.
so those are the topics we're going to be‚Ä¶ to be covering.
We need to think about what to prepare‚Ä¶
Dr White said he wanted us to use plenty of visuals and things and...
we might as well try them out when we're not being assessed.
Well, the most important thing is the overhead projector.
No problem, we'll get that from the media room.
Must remember to book it.
Well‚Ä¶ we'll need a map of course.
Probably two‚Ä¶ one of the islands‚Ä¶ large scale.
And one of West Africa.
Well, the West African one is no problem.
There's one in the Resources Room.
Oh yeah, of course, the resources room;
the islands are going to be more of a problem.
Tell you what, there's a very clear map of Santiago in that tourist brochure I showed you last week.
Don't you remember it?
Oh yeah, that's right;
we can just use the tourist brochure.
We also need statistics on several different things.
Literacy rates.
Yes, and school places.
How about the encyclopedia?
Nah‚Ä¶ not up-to-date enough!
Mmm‚Ä¶ why don't we call the embassy?
Oh‚Ä¶ someone's enthusiastic!
Well‚Ä¶ if something's worth doing‚Ä¶
I know‚Ä¶ it's worth doing well‚Ä¶ okay.
We can find out statistics on school places from them as well.
Might as well.
Look, Julie, it's almost time for our tutorials.
We can meet again on Monday
but we need to prepare...

1197,Cam7 - Test 4 - Part 4,B2,cam7---test-4---part-4,45,"In today's lecture, I'm going to talk about Monosodium Glutamate,
or MSG, as it's more commonly known.
Now, MSG as you probably know, is a flavour enhancer
which is used particularly in Chinese and Japanese cooking.
Today, I am going to explore why it is so popular in these cuisines
and, more importantly, how does it enhance the flavour of food?
The main reason why MSG is more commonly used in Japanese meals is tradition.
For many thousands of years,
the Japanese have incorporated a type of seaweed known as kombu in their cooking,
as they discovered it had the ability to make food taste better.
But it wasn't until 1908
that the ingredient in kombu, which was responsible for the improvement in flavour,
was actually discovered to be glutamate by scientists working there.
From 1908 until 1956,
glutamate was produced commercially in Japan
by a very slow and expensive means of extraction.
It was in 1956 that the speed of the process was improved,
and industrial production increased dramatically
and still continues to increase to this day.
In fact, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of MSG are produced all over the world today.
So what exactly is MSG?
Well, Monosodium Glutamate contains 78.2% glutamate,
12.2% sodium
and 9.6% water.
Glutamate is an amino acid that can be found naturally in all protein-containing foods,
erm, so this includes food such as meat and cheese.
It is widely known that Chinese and Japanese food contains MSG
but many people don't seem to be aware that it is also used in foods in other parts of the world.
For example, it is found in commercially made Italian pizzas,
in American fast food and in Britain, MSG is used in things like potato crisps.
So, how exactly does MSG work?
Well, in the Western world, we commonly talk of four 'tastes',
and I'm sure you're all familiar with the concepts of sweet, sour, bitter and salt.
Well, in 1908, Kikunae Ikeda identified a fifth 'taste'.
And it is thought that MSG intensifies this naturally occurring 'taste' in some food.
It does make perfect evolutionary sense that we should have the ability to detect or taste glutamate
because it is the amino acid which is most common in natural foods.
John Prescott, an associate professor at the University of Chicago,
suggests that this fifth taste serves a purpose just as the other tastes do.
He suggests that it signals to us the presence of protein in food,
in the same way that sweetness indicates that a food contains energy-giving carbohydrates.
Bitterness, he says, alerts us to toxins in the food,
while sourness warns us of spoilage
and saltiness signals the presence of minerals.
So, what else do we know about...

1198,Cam6 - Test 1 - Part 1,B2,cam6---test-1---part-1,87,"Good morning, oh sorry, it's gone 12, I'll start again,
good afternoon, Kingswell Sports Club, how can I help you?
Oh, good afternoon.
I was wondering if you could give me some information about membership and facilities.
Of course.
What would you like to know?
Do you have tennis courts, for example?
No, I'm afraid we don't.
We're primarily a golf club.
What about football?
I heard you had a team.
No, I'm sorry.
Perhaps you're thinking about Fresham Sports Centre.
Oh, right.
I know it.
I've played badminton there.
Have you?
They've got a lot of facilities we don't have and vice versa.
We do have a keep-fit studio, which is very popular with members,
and then as well as that there's swimming, of course.
That's good. I like to swim every day.
We have a range of classes too.
Do you have judo classes?
I'm keen to learn.
Well, at the moment, we offer kick-boxing.
We're planning to add judo and stretch classes soon.
We're currently running a range of yoga classes, too.
What about relaxing after exercise?
I assume you have a restaurant or something.
At the moment, we've got a salad bar which is very popular.
We'll also have a fully-licensed restaurant by the end of the year.
Sounds good!
What kind of membership are you interested in?
Um... I'm not really sure.
What are the options?
Well, there are three different membership schemes.
I see. What's the difference?
Well, the first one's called Gold,
and you can use all the facilities at any time of the day or week.
You can also join in as many classes as you like for free.
That sounds good.
Is it very expensive?
Well, you pay a ¬£250 joining fee
and then it's 450 - oh no, I'm sorry,
it's just gone up by ¬£50, sorry about that -
it's now ¬£500 for the annual subscription fee.
Right, got that.
And what's the next type?
Well, that's Silver -
it's the same as Gold except you have to pay a small fee of ¬£1.00 per lesson for any you do
and you can only use the centre at certain times.
I see. So when exactly?
You can only use the facilities between 10 am and 4.30 pm.
So I couldn't use the pool at 8 in the morning or evening, then?
That's right.
Okay. And the price for that?
Is the joining fee the same as for Gold?
Actually, it's slightly less than the ¬£250 -
it's ¬£225,
but the annual fee is only ¬£300.
Does that sound more like what you want?
Well, it's still rather more expensive than I thought.
I'm a student here in England and I'm only here for six months.
Ah, then the Bronze scheme would probably suit you best.
How is that different?
Well, some of the facilities have restricted use.
And do I have to pay for classes?
Yes, it's ¬£3 for each class you join.
I see. And what are the hours then?
Between 10.30 and 3.30 weekdays only
and you pay a ¬£50 joining fee.
The annual fee is ¬£180 -
it works out at ¬£15 a month, so...
that would be quite a lot cheaper.
Oh, that should be all right.
I could come in my free periods.
What do I have to do if I want to join?
Well, we book you in for an assessment with an instructor,
who will show you how to use all the equipment.
If you want to organise a trial session and look around the centre,
you'll need to speak to David Kynchley.
Could you spell that please?
Yes, David KYNCHLEY.
I'll give you his direct line number.
It's 045895311.
Thanks.
Thank you for calling Kingswell Sports Club.

1199,Cam6 - Test 1 - Part 2,B2,cam6---test-1---part-2,46,"And here on Radio Rivenden we have Lynne Rawley, the Public Relations Officer of our own Rivenden City Theatre.
Hello, Lynne.
Hello.
Now, the theatre is reopening soon after its three-year redevelopment programme, isn't it?
That's right, and there are a lot of improvements.
The first thing people will see when they go in
is that the foyer has been repainted in the original green and gold.
Then the box office has been reoriented, with its own access from the side of the building instead of through the foyer,
which means it can be open longer hours, and has more space, too.
The shop that used to be in the foyer, which sold books and CDs,
is the one part of the redevelopment which isn't yet complete.
The plan is to find new premises for it near the theatre,
and we've had difficulty finding somewhere suitable.
We hope to reopen the shop in the next few months.
Will audiences find any difference in the auditorium?
Yes, we've increased the leg-room between the rows.
This means that there are now fewer seats
but we're sure audiences will be much happier.
And we've installed air conditioning, so it won't get so hot and stuffy.
We already had a few seats which were suitable for wheelchair users,
and now there are twice as many, which we hope will meet demand.
Something else that will benefit audiences is the new lifts.
The two we used to have were very small and slow.
They've now gone, and we've got much more efficient ones.
Anything for the performers?
Yes, we've made a number of improvements backstage.
The small, dark dressing rooms we used to have have been converted into two large airy rooms,
so they're much more comfortable now.
And the state-of-the-art electronic sound and lighting systems have been installed.
Okay, so what's the first play that audiences can see when the theatre reopens?
We've got a very exciting production of Peter Shaffer's Royal Hunt of the Sun, which is currently touring the country.
That starts on October the 13th and runs till the 19th.
We're experimenting a bit with the time the curtain goes up.
We used to start all our performances at 7.30,
but that made it difficult for people to go home by public transport,
so instead, we're beginning at 7,
because at 9.45, when it finishes, there are still buses running.
Tickets are already selling fast.
The Friday and Saturday performances sold out almost immediately
and, in fact, now there are only tickets for Monday and Thursday.
How much are they?
We've introduced a simpler price structure.
Ticket prices used to range from ¬£6 to ¬£30
but now they're all ¬£18.
They're available from the box office, in person, by phone, fax or post, or online.
Okay, Lynne, now if you'd like to give the contact details...

1200,Cam6 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam6---test-1---part-3,73,"Hi, can I help you?
I was told to come here, because I'd like to talk to someone about taking a management course.
Right. I'm one of the tutors, so I should be able to help you.
Oh, good.
My name's Brian Ardley.
I've decided to enroll on a part time management course.
A friend of mine took one last year, and recommended it to me.
Right.
Is there anything I should do before the course, like reading or anything?
We prefer to integrate reading with the course,
so we don't give out a reading list in advance.
But we like people to write a case study, describing an organisation they know.
I've already done that, as my friends told me you wanted one.
But would it be possible to sit in on a teaching session, to see what it's like?
I haven't been a student for quite a while.
Fine.
Just let me know which date, and I'll arrange it with the tutor.
Now, could I ask you about the college facilities, please?
Anything in particular?
Well, the course is one day a week, all day, isn't it?
So presumably it's possible to buy food?
Yes, the refectory's open all day.
Does it cater for special diets? I have some food allergies.
Provided you warn the refectory in advance, it won't be a problem.
Good.
What about facilities for young children?
I'd like to bring my daughter here while I'm studying.
How old is she?
Three.
Then she's eligible to join the nursery,
which is supervised by a qualified Nursery Nurse.
The waiting list for a place is quite long though, so you ought to apply now.
Okay.
I don't know if our careers advice service would be of any interest to you?
Yes, it might help me decide how to develop my career after the course.
The centre has a lot of reference materials, and staff qualified to give guidance on a one-to-one basis.
I noticed a fitness centre next to the college.
Is that for students?
It's open to everyone, but students pay an annual fee that's much less than the general public pay.
And presumably the college library stocks newspapers and journals, as well as books?
Yes, and there's also an audio-visual room, for viewing and listening to videos, cassettes, and so on.
Is there also access to computers?
Yes, your tutor will need to arrange with the technical support team for you to get a password,
so ask him or her about it when you start the course.
Okay.
By the way, do you know about our Business Centre?
No, What's that?
It's a training resource - a collection of materials for people to study on their own, or use in their own organisations.
You mean books and videos?
Yes, and manuals for self-study.
Plus a lot of computer-based materials, so people can work through them at their own speed,
and repeat anything they aren't sure about.
And you can hire laptops to use in your own home or workplace
as well as printers that you can take away.
Does it have anything that I could use to improve my study skills?
I don't have much idea about report writing,
and I'm sure I'll need it on the course.
Oh yes, there's plenty of useful material. Just ask one of the staff.
Does the centre cover all the main areas of business?
Yes, topics like finance, and of course marketing - that's a popular one.
Local managers seem to queue up to borrow the videos!
So it isn't just for students, then?
No, it's for members only, but anyone can join.
How much does it cost?
¬£100 a year for a company,
and ¬£50 for an individual, with no discount for students, I'm afraid.
That's very helpful.
Well, I think that's all.
I'd better go home and fill in the enrollment form.
Thanks for all your help.
You're welcome.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

1201,Cam6 - Test 1 - Part 4,C1,cam6---test-1---part-4,55,"In the last few weeks, we've been looking at various aspects of the social history of London,
and this morning we're continuing with a look at life in the area called the East End.
I'll start with a brief history of the district,
and then focus on life in the first half of the twentieth century.
Back in the first to the fourth centuries AD,
when the Romans controlled England,
London grew into a town of 45,000 people,
and what's now the East End -
the area by the river Thames, and along the road heading north-east from London to the coast -
consisted of farmland with crops and livestock
which helped to feed that population.
The Romans left in 410, at the beginning of the fifth century,
and from then onwards, the country suffered a series of invasions by tribes from present-day Germany and Denmark,
the Angles, Saxons and Jutes, many of whom settled in the East End.
The technology they introduced meant that metal and leather goods were produced there for the first time.
And as the East End was by the river,
ships could transport goods between there and foreign markets.
In the 11th century, in 1066 to be precise,
the Normans conquered England,
and during the next few centuries London became one of the most powerful and prosperous cities in Europe.
The East End benefited from this,
and because there were fewer restrictions there than in the city itself,
plenty of newcomers settled there from abroad,
bringing their skills as workers, merchants or money-lenders during the next few hundred years.
In the 16th century, the first dock was dug
where ships were constructed, eventually making the East End the focus of massive international trade.
And in the late 16th century,
when much of the rest of England was suffering economically,
a lot of agricultural workers came to the East End to look for alternative work.
In the seventeenth century, the East End was still a series of separate, semi-rural settlements.
There was a shortage of accommodation,
so marshland was drained and built on to house the large numbers of people now living there.
By the 19th century, London was the busiest port in the world,
and this became the main source of employment in the East End.
Those who could afford to live in more pleasant surroundings moved out,
and the area became one where the vast majority of people lived in extreme poverty,
and suffered from appalling sanitary conditions.
That brief outline takes us to the beginning of the 20th century,
and now we'll turn to housing.
At the beginning of the century,
living conditions for the majority of working people in East London were very basic indeed.
Houses were crowded closely together
and usually very badly built, because there was no regulation.
But the poor and needy were attracted by the possibility of work,
and they had to be housed.
It was the availability, rather than the condition, of the housing
that was the major concern for tenants and landlords alike.
Few houses had electricity at this time,
so other sources of power were used, like coal for the fires which heated perhaps just one room.
Of course, the smoke from these contributed a great deal to the air pollution
for which London used to be famous.
A tiny, damp, unhealthy house like this might well be occupied by two full families,
possibly including several children, grandparents, aunts and uncles.
Now, before I go on to health implications of this way of life,
I'll say something about food and nutrition.

1202,Cam6 - Test 2 - Part 1,B1,cam6---test-2---part-1,72,"Good morning, Synmouth Museum. Can I help you?
Oh yes. Good morning.
I'm interested in the children's workshops and I'd like a little more information, please.
Do you mean the Art and Craft workshops?
Yes. A friend of a friend mentioned them -
the children do painting and make models and so forth.
Yes, of course.
Um, where to begin?
First of all, as you probably know, they run every Saturday.
Fine. And what about ages?
Well, all ages from five upwards are welcome,
though we do ask that children below eight years of age are accompanied by an adult.
Fine. That wouldn't be a problem.
What about cost?
Well, I think you'll find them very reasonable.
It's ¬£2.50 a child,
with 80 pence off for two or more children from the same family.
Oh yes, very reasonable.
And are they held in the main museum?
Not exactly.
They're nearby.
Could you give me the full address?
I don't know the area very well.
Yes, it's Winter House.
Right.
And that's in Tamer Street.
Could you spell that please?
Yes, TAMER Street.
Lovely.
And I do need to tell you that there's a security entrance,
so you need to press the green button for someone to let you in.
Don't press the red button please,
but don't worry, it's all clearly labelled.
Okay. And one more question -
is parking available nearby?
We're driving in from out of town.
Your best bet is to leave your car at the back of the library -
on a Saturday morning, there are plenty of spaces there.
It's right next door to the museum.
And can I ask about booking places?
Yes, and I must tell you, you really should book by calling the education department here.
Oh, I'm sorry, should I have rung them instead of the main museum number?
No, that's fine this time, please don't worry.
But for future reference, I'll give you the direct number.
It's 200765.
Great, I've got that.
But I'm very happy to give you information about the next two workshops.
On Saturday the 16th, there's Building Castles.
Oh, sounds great!
This involves quite a bit of glue, so just make sure the kids are in old clothes.
I know, ones I don't mind getting mucky.
Exactly.
And if possible, could you bring along bottle tops
which the children might be able to use in the models, you know, as decoration?
We'll certainly try to find some for you.
Then the following week...
That'll be the 23rd, won't it?
Yes, that's right.
On that day, it's what we call Undersea Worlds.
This is where they make scenes with fishes, underground caverns and so on.
Is that likely to get very dirty?
Lots of paint splashes?
Not really, so we don't recommend any special clothes for that one.
But if you could search out some silver paper to bring along to use in the sessions,
you know, it's shiny - it looks like water, that'd be great.
Yes, of course. We'll see what we can come up with.
Well, thank you ever so much for all your help.
The sessions sound really good and I'll certainly book up for the next two.
Lovely.
Thanks very much for ringing.
Bye.
Bye-bye.

1203,Cam6 - Test 2 - Part 2,B1,cam6---test-2---part-2,56,"ÔªøHello.
Um... my family and I are staying here in Trebirch for a week or two
and we wanted to know about the train services.
We're hoping to do a few local trips.
Okay.
Well, I can give you lots of details about all the trains going from Trebirch in the South West.
This leaflet will be very helpful
but I can tell you some of the main things.
We've got two main train stations in the town.
King Street is for local commuter lines and regional services.
What about trains to London?
I'll need to go there on business for one day.
Then you need to go to Central Station -
that's for all the national services.
There are regular trains to London.
They leave Trebirch every half hour on weekdays and every hour at weekends.
It takes about two hours, a bit longer on Sundays.
You've got a choice of first and second class and there's a buffet car -
though refreshments are included in the cost of a first class ticket.
Ah, right.
Um, and have you got any information on different ticket types?
Yes.
There's a range of ticket prices depending on when you travel and when you buy your ticket.
There's a standard open ticket which doesn't have any restrictions.
This can be bought in advance or on the day.
You can also get various discounted tickets.
A popular one is called the Supersave
and, er, this is OK for travel after 8.45.
Then there is the Special ticket,
which is valid for travel after 10:15.
The Special tickets are also valid for travel at weekends.
The cheapest tickets are called Advance
and you have to buy them at least six days ahead.
Only a certain number are available
and you have to make seat reservations for these.
Thanks. And are there lots of places to go to around here?
Oh yes.
You can enjoy many days out.
Um there's the Merthyr Mining Museum,
which is only half an hour from Trebirch by train.
Your children will find it just as fascinating as any theme park
and they can ride in the original miners' lifts and on the coal trains.
There are special excursion tickets which include entrance fees.
Mainline trains also offer direct services to Bristol,
where you can visit the docks or spend a great day out with the children in the zoo,
which is set in the parkland that used to surround the old castle.
Er, special family awayday fares are available for this service now during the school holidays.
Er, alternatively, you can be in Birmingham in only an hour and a half,
where there's lots to see and do including the new and internationally-acclaimed climbing wall
built on the site of the old aquarium.
We will also be running a special service to Newport
when the new science museum opens next year,
as we anticipate a lot of visitors in the opening weeks.
I'd advise you to call early to book your tickets.
Is that OK?
Yes, thanks.

1204,Cam6 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam6---test-2---part-3,86,"Hello, Sandy.
How have you been getting on with your dissertation?
Fine, and I've been working hard on the various action points we agreed on our last tutorial.
Do you want to talk me through what you've done?
Yeah, sure.
Well, we agreed on three main targets for me to aim for.
The first one was to find out about suitable data analysis software.
Yes.
And what I decided to do was to look through catalogues specialising in IT.
That's a good idea.
What did you come up with?
I found the names of two promising ones.
Right.
But I also thought it'd be worthwhile talking to a lecturer.
Oh right.
Who did you see?
Jane Prince. Do you know her?
She's in the Computer Centre.
Yes, of course, she's the new Head.
Yes. Well, she was very helpful.
Oh, that's good.
Did she suggest anything in particular?
Yeah. She recommended software called Vivat
and said I should book up for a couple of practice sessions using Vivat.
Great. I'm sure you'll find them useful.
And, of course, the second target was to draw up a survey checklist...
Yes, you emailed me it last week.
Have you had a chance to look...?
Of course,
um, I think it's good.
Very much on the right lines.
I'd say your first two sections are spot on.
I wouldn't suggest that you change anything there, but...
in section three you really do need to have questions on teaching experience.
Yeah. I was thinking that section looked a bit short.
Right.
And my third target was, do further reading on discipline.
Oh yes. I mentioned a couple of writers, didn't I?
Yes, well, I got hold of the Banerjee and I thought that was excellent.
But I'm afraid I didn't manage to get hold of the essays about classroom management,
you know, the ones by Simon Ericsson.
The bookshop said it was out of print and the library doesn't have a copy.
Oh right, and I'm afraid I've lent my copy to another student.
What I suggest you do is try the library again -
this time apply for it through the service called special loans.
Have you done that before?
You're entitled to six books a year.
Yes.
No problem. That's what I'll do.
So, lots of useful work done.
So, let's look at some new targets.
We'll start by having a chat about your Chapter One.
I very much enjoyed reading it.
Your written style is very clear
and you've included lots of interesting descriptions of education in your target area.
I've just got a couple of suggestions for some additional work.
Of course.
Could I just ask - what do you think I should call it?
Well, I'd go for something like Context Review.
What do you think?
Well, short and to the point.
Exactly.
Now, as regards specific areas to work on,
I'd be quite interested to have a few more statistics about the schools in the different zones.
Oh, that wouldn't be a problem. I can get them from the Internet.
Great,
and although you did make a reference to quite a few different writers,
I think you should aim to cite more works written later than 2000.
Okay.
That's more difficult, but I can try.
When do you want that done by?
Oh, it's not urgent.
Um, I should aim for the end of term.
But in the meantime, I think you should also be thinking about Chapter Two.
Should I be drafting it already?
No, but I think you should note down its main sections.
Yes.
You know, I always find that the hardest part.
I always find it helpful to put some ideas on index cards.
Um... and then you can sort them, and even lay them out on the floor.
It's a real help.
Well, I'll certainly try it!
When would the deadline be for that?
My advice would be to get it done before you embark upon the research.
You can always change it later if you need to.
Okay. I'll get going on that...

1205,Cam6 - Test 2 - Part 4,B2,cam6---test-2---part-4,62,"Many believe that the story first began in America in 1877,
when two friends were arguing over whether a horse ever had all four feet or hooves off the ground when it galloped.
To settle the bet, a photographer was asked to photograph a horse galloping
and the bet was settled because you could see that all the hooves were off the ground in some of the photos.
What was even more interesting was that if the photos were shown in quick succession
the horse looked like it was running -
in other words 'moving pictures'.
The person who became interested in taking the moving pictures to its next step
was the famous American inventor Thomas Edison.
Actually, he didn't do the work himself but rather asked a young Scotsman in his employ to design a system,
which he did.
Now this young fellow was clever
because the first thing he did was study other systems -
primitive as they were of moving pictures
and then put all the existing technologies together to make the first entire motion picture system.
He designed a camera, a projection device and the film.
The system was first shown in New York in 1894 and was really very popular.
Apparently, people lined up around the block to see the wonderful new invention.
There were, however, a couple of problems with the system.
The camera weighed over 200 kilograms
and only one person at a time could see the film.
Well now, news of the new system in America travelled fast
and a number of rival European systems started to appear once people had heard about it.
The single problem with all the systems was they couldn't really project the film onto a screen -
you know, so more than one person could see it.
Then in 1895;
three systems were all developed,
more or less at the same time and independently of each other.
I guess the most famous of these was by the Lumiere Brothers from France,
and they called their system the cinematographe
which of course is where the word cinema comes from.
There were also two brothers in Germany who developed a successful system and they called it a bioskop.
Well now, once the problem of projection had been solved,
the next challenge for the inventors was to make the films longer and more interesting.
A continuing problem at the time was that the films had a tendency to break when they were being played -
a problem which was caused by the tension between the two wheels,
or 'reels' as they are called, which hold the film.
Now this problem was solved by two American brothers.
They developed the 'Lantham Loop',
which was the simple addition of a third reel between the two main reels,
and this took all the tension away with the result that the film stopped snapping.
So now there was a real possibility of having films of more than two or three minutes,
and this led to the making of The Great Train Robbery - the very first movie made.
It only lasted 11 minutes but was an absolute sensation,
and there were cases of people watching the movie and actually fainting when the character fired a gun at the camera!
Almost overnight movies became a craze,
and by 1905, people in America were lining up to see movies in 'store theatres', as they were called then.
I guess the next big step in terms of development of technology
was to have people actually talking on the film,
and the first step towards this was in 1926
when sound effects were first used on a film.
It wasn't until the following year however that the first 'talkie', as they were called then, was made.
This film featured actors speaking only during parts of the film
and was called The Jazz Singer,
and it wasn't until 1928 that the first all-talking film was produced,
and this was called The Lights of New York.
Unfortunately, the sound on this early film was not very good
and I believe they put subtitles on the film -
that is, they printed the dialogue along the bottom of the film
to compensate for this poor sound quality.
Now, with the addition of sound,
moving pictures became far more difficult...

Certainly.
If you'd like to take a seat, I'll just get some details from you.
It won't take long.
Thanks.
Is it a current account or a deposit account you wanted?
A current account.
Right.
I've got the application form here then.
We have different types - I see you've got our leaflet there.
I've decided on the one called 'Select.'
Right, that's fine, so, first of all, can I have your full name please?
Yes, it's Pieter Henes.
That's PIETER.
Is it HENNES?
Uh, only one N actually. It's a less common spelling of the name.
Oh, right. Okay.
And what's your date of birth please?
The 27th of the first, 1973.
Right.
And will this be a joint account?
No, just myself.
Okay, fine.
And where are you living, Mr Henes?

Would you like my home number too?
Yes please.
It's 796431.
Are they both local numbers?
Yes.

Well, I'm in Britain as a project manager, but that's not my main job.
I'm an engineer by profession.
I see.
I think I'll put that then. It's shorter!
Now, we usually ask for a piece of information which we can use to check your identity, for security reasons.
You know, if you phone us.

1207,Cam6 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam6---test-3---part-2,64,"Welcome, everybody, to the lovely house and gardens of Rosewood,
once the home of the famous writer, Sebastian George.
He bought the house in 1902
although he had first seen it two years earlier.
At that time, the owners let it out to a tenant
because George was too slow making up his mind to buy it.
When it came back on the market, there was no hesitation
and he bought it immediately, for ¬£9,300,
even though the house had no bathroom, no running water upstairs, and no electricity.
When he came here, he'd been married for ten years.
During that time, he'd become one of the most famous writers in the English-speaking world.
His professional success was enormous,
but his personal life wasn't as successful.
He was no longer on speaking terms with his brother
and had been devastated by the death at the age of seven of his elder daughter, Josephine.
Moving to Rosewood allowed the family to start a new life.
George regarded Rosewood as a pure example of a traditional country house of this part of England
and did some of his most successful writing here.
The house and its grounds became the family haven
and their escape to privacy and quiet.
The walls, and the mullioned windows were built of the local sandstone,
the tiles on the roofs and the bricks of the chimney stack were baked from local clay,
and the wooden structures inside came from oak trees which grow around here.
Now, please look at the map I've given you of the house and gardens.
We're here at the Information Centre.
Follow the path marked with the arrow
and the first area you come to is the orchard on your left.
As you go further down the path, there's the kitchen garden on the right
and as you go round the first sharp corner
you will find, to your left, an area where different types of pear tree have been planted
as well as some lovely flowers,
and this is known as Pear Alley - designed by George himself.
Next to this is the greenhouse
where some exotic plants and fruits are grown.
Follow the path round the second corner
and on your right you will see the entrance to the Mulberry Garden
with its 500-year-old tree.
Past the Mulberry Garden, follow the path until you reach the front of the house.
I suggest you spend a good hour wandering around this lovely building.
A guide takes visitor groups round every two hours.
If you would like to purchase any of George's books or other souvenirs,
then leave the house by the side entrance,
where you will find our shop, which is situated between the house and the garage
which contains the magnificent old Rolls-Royce car
which used to belong to George.
I expect by this time you may also be in need of a rest and some refreshment.
Most visitors are, so why don't you visit the tea room on the far side of the garage?
If you have time, there is a lovely walk down towards the River Dudwell.
For me, this is the best part of the estate.
This isn't on the map but it is all clearly signposted.
You cross the field which spreads along the banks of the river.
In spring, this area is well worth a visit.
Spend a minute or two watching the water pass by underneath as you cross the footbridge,
and then continue along the River Walk through the woodland.
On a hot summer's day the trees along this path provide welcome shade.
Eventually, you come to the water mill
which used to provide the electricity for the house -
only about four hours every evening - in George's time.
And, finally, for those of you who would like to see stunning views of the surrounding countryside
and who are a little bit more energetic,
when you return from the mill, take the first turning on your left
and climb up to the viewpoint.
You won't regret it.
Enjoy your visit!

We've only got five weeks left to the end of term to design it,
carry it out, and then write up the results.
Sure. Well, let's get started right now.
Let's go over the instructions.
What exactly do we have to do?
Well, it says here we have to look at one area of the entertainment industry.
There's a list of the different types.
What are they?
Music, cinema, theatre, sport, and eating out.
Is that all?
Looks like it.
So we choose one branch of the industry
and then we look at how two different groups of people use it?
Is that right?
Yes.
And do we have to use any particular method to get our data?
Can we mail out a questionnaire, or do face-to-face interviews, or maybe even observations?
Well actually, it looks like we don't have a choice.
We have to do telephone interviews.
Okay, so at least we don't have to waste time deciding between the different methods.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, and the other requirement is the number of interviewees.
Not too many, I hope. Ten? Twenty?
Well, we have to do two groups, remember,
and it looks like we have to interview fifteen for each group.
That's thirty altogether then.
It's going to take ages.
Yes, but remember we're working on this together,
so we'll only have to do fifteen each.
Okay, so those are all the requirements?
Yes, looks like it.
So, first, which area are we going to choose?
My preference would be cinema, since that's where I spend most of my money.
Hmm, I don't think that's such a good idea.
I don't think there are huge differences in the market there.
I mean, you get young and old, male and female, rich and poor...
all going to the same movies.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Let's make it music then.
Right.
So, what two groups will we compare and contrast?
Male and female?
No.
Most of my female friends like the same music as me.
Different age groups would be much more likely to show up differences, I think.
Yeah, I suppose you're right again.
I'll take some notes, shall I?
So... Age Groups.
What do you think?
Maybe 25 or under for one group, and 45 or over for the other group?
That should show up differences.
Right.
Okay. Next.
How about the kind of music they like? Let's give them some choices and then we can just tick boxes.
Okay. Let's have pop, jazz, folk, easy listening...
What else?
Well, we should include classical.
Some people like it, you know.
Okay.
And then we should have how they listen to music.
The medium. Right. Let's include radio, CD...
and then I guess there's TV.
What about concerts? You know, in pubs and halls.
Oh yeah, we should include live music of course.
Okay, we're on a roll now!
Next point could be about where they actually get their music.
You mean like, do they buy it in music shops, or department stores?
Yes, or download it from the Internet.
Right. That could be for recorded music.
Then we need another section for live music.
Where do they go for that?
Okay. Let's say disco, pub, club, concert hall...
Or opera house!
And I guess we should include karaoke bars.
Not many of them in this city!
Okay. We'll leave that out then.
So, what's left to do?
That's it.
Well, now we can make a time-scale for doing it.

1209,Cam6 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam6---test-3---part-4,75,"Good morning everyone.
Last week we were looking at the hunter-gatherers in Ireland,
across the Irish Sea from England.
Today, we're going to move on to the period between 4 and 6000 years ago,
known as the Neolithic period,
which is when a total farming economy was introduced in Ireland.
Now, there are several hypotheses about the origins of the first Neolithic settlers in Ireland,
but most of these contain problems.
For instance, there are considerable archaeological difficulties about the theory that they came from England.
The evidence doesn't really add up.
But there are even greater practical problems about the theory that they came directly from continental Europe.
For one thing, it's not clear just how sufficient numbers of men and women could have been transported to Ireland
to establish a viable population.
As you know, the hunter-gatherer economy which existed beforehand was based on small scattered groups.
The farming economy would almost certainly have required much larger communities
to do all the work needed to plant and tend sufficient crops to sustain them through the year.
The early farmers kept various animals, including cattle and sheep.
There's also evidence of pigs,
but it is possible that these could have been descended from the native wild species.
Now, we know from modern farming that if the level of breeding stock falls below about 300 females,
the future of the species locally is at risk.
So we must assume that from the beginnings of Neolithic farming,
the number of breeding sheep would have considerably exceeded 300,
and the national cattle herd must have been of a similar size.
The question is how these were brought to the area and where they came from.
It's usually suggested that the Neolithic settlers used skin-covered boats to transport livestock.
But this method would have severely restricted the range of the colonising fleets.
The sheer volume of animal transport necessary
means it's unlikely that this livestock could have been brought from anywhere further than England.
What about crops?
Well, two main cereal crops were introduced to Ireland during this time:
wheat and barley, both in several varieties.
The main evidence for their presence consists of impressions on pottery,
where a cereal grain accidentally became embedded in the surface of a pot before it was fired.
The grain itself was destroyed by the firing,
but it left an impression on the pot
which could be studied and identified by botanists.
Let's turn our attention now to the farming technology available at that time.
Before the cereal crops could be planted,
it would have been necessary to clear the forest and to break the ground by ploughing.
The stone blade of a plough has been discovered during excavation in County Mayo in western Ireland.
The body of the plough would have been of wood
and could have been drawn by people,
but it's also likely that cattle were used.
Now, the cultivation of crops and the husbandry of livestock brought about changes in people's lifestyle
such as the type of shelters they made.
For one thing, instead of moving from place to place
they needed permanent dwellings.
The stone axes used to chop down trees to make these dwellings
were far superior to any that the Stone Age hunter-gatherers used.
To make the axes, sources of suitable stone had to be found and systematically exploited.
These so-called 'axe factories' were really quarries rather than factories,
as the manufacture of the axes wasn't regularly performed on the quarry site.
However, after the axe had been chipped into shape,
they needed water and sand for grinding and polishing,
so a high mountainside wouldn't have been an appropriate place for this.
So this final stage of the manufacture must have been carried out close to water
and sure enough, there's ample evidence of this at coastal sites.
Now it's clear that these Neolithic axes were transported all over Ireland,
as well as to Scotland and the south of England.
It's not really surprising that axes from 'axe factories' in England have also been found in Ireland.
At the very least, this indicates that there was a link between the two islands during that period.
One of the most useful innovations of the colonisers was pottery making,
which was quite unknown to Irish hunter-gatherers.
The pottery was probably made by shaping clay into a ball with the hand,
and then hollowing it until the walls were the right thickness.
After firing, the outside was often polished.
This would have helped the pots to retain water, as they weren't glazed.
Now we know that the clay used usually came from local sources,
which suggests that manufacture was on a fairly small scale,
even though thousands of fragments are usually found at Neolithic sites.
In the course of time decoration began to appear.
At first this looked like a series of stitches and was just around the tops of the pots.
This could have been an imitation of earlier vessels which were made of leather sewn onto wood.
Then eventually pots with decoration...

Hi. I'm interested in the computing conference next month.
Future Directions in Computing?
Yes, that's right.
Could I ask you a few questions about it?
Of course.
OK.
I know the conference is for three days
but actually I want to attend on the Friday and Saturday only.
Will that work out to be any cheaper?
Let me have a look.
Well, you could register for the two days separately,
but that wouldn't actually save you very much
as it still costs ¬£35 for each day.
In fact, if you could register for the three days,
you also get an invitation to a free dinner on the Saturday night,
so that's probably the better option.
Right, I'll do that.
How much will the fees be in that case?
It's ¬£75.
All right.
I'd like to register for the full three days.
Now, can I pay that by credit card?
I'm afraid not.
You'll have to send a cheque to us,
or you can pay at the conference office.
Fine.
So it's probably easiest if I pay by cheque.
Now then, what else do I need to arrange?
Right. How about accommodation?
I guess that's not included in the price?
No, I'm sorry, it's not,
but we do have a few rooms available for delegates at the conference centre if you'd like.
Those are very cheap but if you're interested you'll need to book soon,
because there's always a heavy demand for them.
They are only ¬£15 per night,
but they are very basic and you'd have to get your own breakfast,
because they don't provide you with that.
But it's very convenient,
because it's in the same building as the conference rooms.
Uhuh.
Or there's a very reasonable guest house which is ¬£25 per night.
And I think that includes your breakfast.
Is it close to the conference centre?
It would be about a ten-minute walk away from here.
I see.
That sounds quite reasonable.
The details are all in our conference pack, which I'll send you.
Great, thanks.
That'll be very useful.
Oh, and can you also send me an application form?
Of course.
I'll get that in the post to you straight away.
Is there anything else?
Yes, actually.
Can you tell me where exactly the conference centre is?
Well, it's on South Park Road and it's right at the end of the road next to the library.
It's a ten-minute taxi ride from the station
and will cost you ¬£5.
Otherwise, you can take the bus which runs every half an hour from the station,
that's the 21A,
and it brings you straight to the conference centre.

1211,Cam6 - Test 4 - Part 2,B2,cam6---test-4---part-2,67,"Good morning and welcome, everybody.
I'm Jenny Stewart
and I'm the Staff Manager here at the exhibition centre.
We're expecting this year's International Travel Exhibition
to attract over 10,000 visitors a day, ladies and gentlemen,
and you are among the 200 extra staff recruited to help look after them.
Now, to help things run smoothly,
we have divided you into four teams -
the blue team, the green team, the red team, and the yellow team.
So first, I'll explain how the teams are divided up,
and then we'll be giving you colour-coded T-shirts so we can identify you more easily.
First of all, those who will be looking after the phones
and handling all calls regarding the exhibition,
you will be on the red team.
Now, we've also put the entrance staff on the red team
and you'll be stamping the entrance tickets and giving out publicity leaflets, okay?
Those of you involved in distributing entrance tickets will be on the yellow team
and we've also put those of you who'll be staffing the information booths around the conference centre on the yellow team, so...
you'll be getting a yellow T-shirt.
Now, most of the hospitality staff have been put in the blue team,
so the chefs among you and the kitchen hands will all need a blue T-shirt, but...
because of the sheer numbers,
all waiting staff will be on the yellow team,
and this includes the bar staff among you.
Those who will be monitoring and directing the traffic in the car parks are on the green team,
so you'll need to get a green T-shirt.
This year, we've also employed a considerable number of attendants
to direct the human traffic around the conference centre.
Now, you'll be working in the exhibition hall at all times,
giving directions and generally helping people whenever you can,
and you will be in the red team, so please collect a red T-shirt.
Right, now that everyone knows what team they're in,
we'll get on with the orientation and training programme
and first, I'll run through the rest of today's programme,
which you should have in front of you,
so that you can get a general idea of what else is in store today.
This introduction finishes at 9.30
and then you'll be hearing from Anne Smith.
Anne works in the accounts department on level two
and she looks after all temporary staff,
and so she is the person to see if you have any problems regarding pay.
Anne will be explaining when and how you get this.
She will also be handing out your tax forms.
And I will just stress that all tax forms must be completed
and returned to Anne before your pay can be processed.
Following Anne's talk you'll hear from Peter Chen, our Conference Manager,
and he will be going over a plan of the conference centre with you,
which will help you to orient yourselves.
He will also go through the security arrangements with you
and show you the fire exits.
Then at 10.30,
there will be a coffee break in the staff canteen,
which is located down on the ground floor.
Now, after the break,
we'll be moving to a different location for a video presentation,
so instead of coming back here,
we'd like you all to go to Lecture Room 311.
You'll find it on this same level, just down the hall,
and there you will be shown a video about important safety issues in the workplace,
called Safety at Work.
We'll finish off the morning with lunch,
which should give everyone a chance to meet and get to know each other,
and we'll be serving you a buffet lunch in the Main Hall,
which is on the first floor, from 12.00 o'clock.
After lunch, you'll be divided up into your teams to meet your team leaders
and we're hoping to be all finished by 3.00, so...
I won't delay you any longer...

1212,Cam6 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam6---test-4---part-3,79,"Good afternoon. Can I help you?
Good afternoon.
Yes, I've just transferred to the School of Education,
and I'd like information about joining the library.
Well, the School of Education has libraries on two sites, as I'm sure you know.
This one here is the Fordham Site, and the other is on Castle Road.
And is there any difference between the two libraries?
Not in terms of their facilities.
Access to online databases and the Internet is available at both sites
and each site has a range of reference materials on education.
Oh yes. I see.
But the Castle Road site has books on the sociology of education
and a collection of textbooks and teaching resources
covering most of the subjects taught in secondary schools.
Ah, right,
but I'm training to be a primary teacher
so I need to look at materials for the five to eleven age group.
Then you've come to the right place.
At Fordham we hold material relating to primary education,
as well as special needs,
but of course you'll need to familiarise yourself with both sites to make the most of our resources.
You haven't mentioned periodicals.
Are they held at both sites?
Current issues, yes but if you want to look at back issues
you'll need to use the CD-ROM databases which are held here at Fordham.
I see.
Now, about borrowing books.
I'm living out of town, so I'm hoping I can borrow quite a few items,
and cut down on the number of trips I have to make.
Right, well, members can borrow two books at a time from each site.
Only two books?
Only two from each site, but that's four altogether.
Oh I see,
and how long can I hang on to them for?
The borrowing period is one month, but of course books can be renewed.
You can renew any item a maximum of three times.
Do I have to come to the library to do that?
No, you can do it by telephone or email,
but you can't renew overdue books this way,
only before or on the due date stamped in the book.
We'll need your full name, your borrower number
and the name of the site library you borrowed the items from.
So theoretically I can borrow books for up to three months -
is that what you're saying?
Yes, provided they're not recalled.
So, what happens then?
Well, sometimes an item is requested by another borrower,
in which case we'd send you a letter,
and you'd have to return the book within seven working days.
Don't forget we're closed on Sundays.
Okay.
I expect it'll take me a while to find what I need.
There's such a lot here.
Yes, there is,
but if you need help getting started,
this term we're running three study skills workshops.
Oh?
What are they on?
Er, let me see.
The first one's on resources...
yes, here it is.
How to use the library's resources.
That includes everything, not just the print and technical resources.
That sounds useful.
Is there anything on using the Internet?
Er, let's see.
The one on the Internet for beginners was last term.
This term it's finding research materials online.
That sounds interesting too,
hm, what's the last one?
It's a workshop on dissertations.
What do you mean? how to write one?
Er, no it's more to do with academic writing conventions,
you know, writing a bibliography and how to refer to sources in your text.
That sort of thing.
Anyway, here's a leaflet with information about all three.
Thanks a lot.
That'll be very useful.
You're welcome.

1213,Cam6 - Test 4 - Part 4,B2,cam6---test-4---part-4,59,"Well, most people think that lions only come from Africa.
And you would be forgiven for thinking this,
because in fact, most lions do come from Africa.
But this hasn't always been the case.
If we go back 10,000 years, we would find that there were lions roaming vast sections of the globe.
But now, unfortunately,
only very small sections of the lions' former habitat remain.
My particular interest is Asiatic lions,
which are a sub-species of African lions.
It's almost 100,000 years since the Asiatic lions split off and developed as a sub-species.
At one time the Asiatic lion was living as far west as Greece
and they were found from there,
in a band that spread east through various countries of the Middle East,
all the way to India.
In museums, you can now see Greek coins that have clear images of the Asiatic lion on them.
Most of them are dated at around 500 B.C.
However, Europe saw its last Asiatic lion roaming free 2000 years ago.
Over the next nineteen hundred years the numbers of Asiatic lions in the other areas declined steadily,
but it was only in the nineteenth century that they disappeared from everywhere but India.
So, how can you tell an Asiatic lion from an African lion,
with which you're probably more familiar?
Well, in general, Asiatic lions are not as big as African lions.
The colour is more or less the same, but the appearance of the mane is different -
that's the hair around the lion's face and neck.
The Asiatic lion's mane is noticeably shorter than the African lion's.
Asiatic lions also have a long fold of skin on their undersides,
whereas not many African lions have this.
Well, I'd like to talk to you now about the Gir Sanctuary in India.
That's where I've just come back from.
The sanctuary was established specifically to protect the Asiatic lion.
It's 1.450 square kilometres in area and most of it is forest.
There are now around 300 Asiatic lions in India
and almost all of them are in this sanctuary.
But despite living in a sanctuary, which makes them safe from hunters,
they still face a number of problems that threaten their survival.
One of these is the ever-present danger of disease.
This is what killed more than a third of Africa's Serengeti lions in 1994,
and people are fearful that something similar could happen in the Gir Sanctuary
and kill off many of the Asiatic lions there.
India's lions are particularly vulnerable because they have a limited gene pool.
The reason for this is interesting -
it's because all of them are descended from a few dozen lions that were saved by a prince
who took a particular interest in them.
He was very wealthy, and he managed to protect them -
otherwise they'd probably have died out completely.
When you see the Asiatic lion in India,
what you sense is enormous vitality.
They're very impressive beasts
and you would never guess that they had this vulnerability when you look at them.
The Asiatic lions don't have the Gir Sanctuary to themselves, I should add.
They actually share it with about 2000 farmers.
A significant proportion of the lions' diet is made up of the livestock of these farmers -
goats, chickens and so on -
as much as a third, in fact.
And they've even been known to attack humans, especially in times of drought.
One final piece of interesting information -
in ancient India, one of the greatest tests of leadership for a man was to fight a lion.
Now it seems, in modern India it will be a great test to see if the lion can be saved.
I'm sure this is something that all of you will share concern for too.

1214,Cam5 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam5---test-1---part-1,90,"Good afternoon, Dreamtime Travel.
How can I help you?
Oh hello.
I'm interested in the holidays you offer along the coast near here.
Yes. We operate several tours up the coast.
Where in particular did you want to go?
Well, I like the sound of the holiday that mentioned whales.
Was it 'Whale Watching""?
Oh, that's our Whale Watch Experience.
It's very popular
and it's based in a lovely little town with nice beaches.
Oh right, and how long does it last?
It's two days
that includes four hours' travel time each way from here.
Good, I don't want to be away any longer than that.
So is that by coach?
Actually it's by minibus.
We like to keep those tours small and personal so we don't take a whole coachload of people.
In fact, we only take up to fifteen people on this tour,
although we do run it with just twelve or thirteen.
Oh, right.
So do you run these tours often?
Well, it depends on the time of year.
Of course in peak times like the summer holidays, we do them every weekend,
but at the moment, it's usually once a month at most.
And when is the next one going?
Mmm, let me see.
Um, there's one in three weeks' time which is April the 18th,
and then we don't have another one until June the 2nd.
And is April a good time to go?
Pretty good.
Though the really good time is later in the year.
I have to say though that the whale sighting is only one of the many things offered.
Really?
Yes.
The hotel itself where you stay has great facilities.
It's called The Pallisades.
The Paris what?
No, it's actually The Pallisades,
PALLISADES.
It's right on the main beach there.
Oh, I see.
All of the rooms have nice views and the food is really good there too.
Oh right.
And what about the other things?
You know, that are included in the price.
Oh, there are lots of things.
If you don't want to do the whale watch cruise,
your guide will take anyone who is interested either on a bushwalk through the national park near the hotel,
and there's no extra charge for that,
or on a fishing trip.
That's an extra $12 I think.
And there's also a reptile park in town -
that costs more or less the same.
No, I think I'd prefer whales to snakes.
Yeah.
And if you just want to relax, you are free to sit by the hotel pool or go down the beach.
Oh, and they also have tennis courts at the hotel,
but you have to pay for those by the hour.
But there are table tennis tables downstairs
and they're part of the accommodation package.
Just speak to your guide.
Well, that sounds good.
So how much is the basic tour price?
At this time of year, it's usually around $300 but...
let me check.
Oh, it's actually $280.
And the next tour, are there any places on that one?
How many people is it for?
There are two of us.
Yes, that should be fine.
Can I just mention that we require all bookings to be made at least 14 days before you travel
to avoid cancellations of tours.
And if you cancel within seven days of departure,
you will have to pay 50% of your total booking.
Okay.
And you also need to pay a 20% deposit at the time of booking.
Can I pay that by credit card?
Yes, you can.
All right, what I'll do is I'll talk to my partner and get back to you.
Fine.
So, I'll make a provisional booking, shall I?
Two for the Whale Watch Experience.
Let me issue you with a customer reference number for when you call back.
Do you have a pen?
Yes.
OK, it's 39745T.
That's T for tango.
When you call back, ask to speak to the Tour Manager, that's me, Tracy.
Fine, I will.

1215,Cam5 - Test 1 - Part 2,B2,cam5---test-1---part-2,46,"Hello and welcome to today's 'Buyer Beware' programme,
where we give you some tips on how to spend your money wisely.
Now, in today's show we're looking at beds for children and babies.
Let's start by looking at baby cots,
that's for children of up to three years old.
We tested three different cots all in the budget price range and, as usual,
we will feature the good points, the problems and our verdict.
The first cot we looked at was by Baby Safe
and it had several good points to recommend it.
Our testers liked the fact that it had four wheels,
so it was easy to move around.
The only slight problems with this cot were that it had no brakes,
but they didn't think that mattered too much.
At first they were a bit concerned about the side bar,
because they felt babies could trap their fingers in it,
but our testers felt that this was unlikely to happen,
so they have given this one a verdict of 'satisfactory'.
The next cot was by Choice Cots
and this time our testers were pleased to find a cot which is simple to put together -
unlike others we looked at.
On the minus side, our testers did not like the fact that the side of the cot did not drop down,
making it difficult to pick up newborn babies.
However, the real problem with this cot was the space between the bars;
our testers found they were too wide
and a baby could easily trap his head.
We felt this was a real safety hazard
and so we have labelled this one dangerous, I'm afraid.
And finally better news for the Mother's Choice cot.
This cot was slightly different in that, although the side bar did not drop down,
the base could be raised or lowered into two different positions
making it safe as well as convenient.
The negatives for this one were quite minor;
the only niggle everyone had was the fact that it has no wheels
and the only other problem anyone could find was that there were pictures
which were simply stuck on and so could easily become detached.
The makers have now promised to discontinue this practice.
As this cot will then be safe in every way,
we have made the Mother's Choice cot our best buy,
Congratulations Mother's Choice!
So, what features should you look for in a baby's cot?
Well obviously safety is a very important factor as well as comfort and convenience.
We recommend that, if you are buying a cot,
do make sure that any metal present is not rusted or bent in any way.
You should ensure your cot has only rounded or smooth edging without any sharp edges,
this is especially important for wooden cots.
And now on to beds...

1216,Cam5 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam5---test-1---part-3,74,"Excuse me, I was told to come here for advice about...
Management Diploma courses?
You've certainly come to the right place.
Hi, my name is Monica.
Nice to meet you.
My name is Andrew, Andrew Harris.
So, Andrew, have you seen our diploma course prospectus yet?
Yes, I've already looked at it.
In fact, I thought the information on course content was really useful,
but I'm afraid I'm a bit confused by all the different ways you can do the course:
full-time intensive, part-time and so on.
Well, let's see if I can help.
I think each course type has its advantages and disadvantages, so it really depends on you -
your own study habits, and your financial circumstances, of course.
Are you working at the moment?
Yes. I've been working in the administration section of the local hospital for the last three years.
And before that I worked in the office of a computer engineering company for two years.
So, I've got about five years of relevant work experience.
And what I'm hoping to focus on is Personnel Management.
I see.
And are you planning to leave your current job to study,
or are you thinking about just taking a year off?
I want to know what my options are, really.
I don't want to quit my job or anything
and my employers are keen for me to get some more qualifications
but obviously, it would be better if I could do a course without taking too much time away from work.
Right, so you don't really want to do the full-time course, then?
No, not really.
It's also a question of finances.
You see, my office have agreed to pay the cost of the course itself,
but I would have to take unpaid leave if I want to study full-time and, well...
I don't think I could afford to support myself with no salary for a whole year.
Okay.
Well, you have two other possibilities:
you could either do the part-time course -
that would be over two years and you wouldn't have to take any time off work -
or you could do what we call a 'modular' course.
You could do that in eighteen months if you wanted or longer,
it's quite flexible and it would be up to you.
So what does the part-time course involve?
For that you would join an evening class and have a lecture twice a week.
Then, you'd have to attend a seminar or discussion workshop one weekend a month.
What kind of coursework would I have to do?
Well, it's a mixture.
You'd be expected to write an essay each month, which counts towards your final assessment.
You have a case study to do by the end of the course,
which might involve doing a survey or something like that,
and also you need to hand in a short report every four weeks.
So, that's quite a lot of work, then, on top of working every day.
It sounds like a lot of studying and really tiring.
Yeah, you certainly wouldn't have much free time!
What about the 'modular' course?
What would I have to do for that?
That's where you get the opportunity to study full-time for short periods.
That way you can cover a lot of coursework
and attend lectures and seminars during the day.
And each module lasts for one term, say, about twelve weeks at a time.
There are obvious advantages in this -
the main one being that you can study in a much more intensive way,
which suits some people much better.
And how many of these 'modules' would I have to do to get the diploma?
The current programme is two modules -
and then you have to choose a topic to work in more depth -
but you can base that on your job,
and so you don't need to be away from the office,
and how long it takes is up to you.
The important thing is that you don't have to study and work.
You can focus on one thing at a time.
Yes, I can see that.
It certainly sounds attractive!
It would be more expensive, though.
I mean, I'd have to support myself without pay for each module.
That's true, so that might be a problem for you.
Look, why don't you talk this over with your employers...
",https://dailydictation.com/upload/ielts-listening/ielts-cambridge-5-test-1-part-3-2023-08-04-13-17-31/0-ielts-cambridge-5-test-1-part-3.mp3,4,65
1217,Cam5 - Test 1 - Part 4,C1,cam5---test-1---part-4,64,"Okay, so we've been looking at the attitudes of various social and cultural groups towards the management of their personal finances -
how important they feel it is to save money,
and what they save their money for.
One aspect that we haven't yet considered is gender.
So if we consider gender issues,
we're basically asking whether men and women have different attitudes towards saving money,
and whether they save money for different things.
Back in 1928 the British writer George Bernard Shaw
wrote in his Intelligent Women's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism
that 'a man is supposed to understand politics. economics and finance'
'and is therefore unwilling to accept essential instruction.'
He also said, 'A woman, having fewer pretensions, is far more willing to learn'.
Now, though these days people might question a lot of the assumptions contained in those statements,
recent research does suggest that there are some quite fundamental differences between men and women
in their attitudes to economic matters.
Let's look at what men and women actually save for.
Research studies of women in North America have found that...
women are far more likely to save for their children's education
and they are also more likely to save up in order to buy a house one day.
The same studies have found that men, on the other hand,
tend to save for a car,
which, by the way, takes a surprisingly large amount of the household budget in North America.
But the other main priority for men when saving money is their retirement.
When they're earning, they're far more likely to put money aside for their old age than women are.
Now, this is rather disturbing,
because in fact the need for women to save for their old age is far greater than for men.
Let's consider this for a moment.
To start with, it is a fact that throughout the world,
women are likely to live many years longer than men,
so they need money to support them during this time.
Since women are likely to be the ones left without a partner in old age,
they may therefore have to pay for nursing care,
because they don't have a spouse to look after them.
Furthermore the high divorce rates in North America are creating a poverty cycle for women.
It is the divorced women who will most often have to look after the children
and thus they need more money to look after not just themselves but others.
So what can be done about this situation?
The population in North America is likely to contain an increasing number of elderly women.
The research indicates that at present
for women, it takes a crisis to make them think about their future financial situation.
But of course, this is the very worst time for anyone to make important decisions.
Women today need to look ahead, think ahead -
not wait until they're under pressure.
Even women in their early twenties need to think about pensions, for example,
and with increasing numbers of women in professional positions,
there are signs that this is beginning to happen.
Then research also suggests that
women avoid dealing effectively with their economic situation
because of a lack of confidence.
The best way for them to overcome this
is by getting themselves properly informed
so they are less dependent on other people's advice.
A number of initiatives have been set up to help them do this.
This College, for example, is one of the educational institutions
which offers night classes in Money Management,
and increasing numbers of women are enrolling on such courses.
Here, they can be given advice on different ways of saving.
Many women are unwilling to invest in stocks and shares, for instance,
but these can be extremely profitable.
It is usually advised that at least 70% of a person's savings should be in low-risk investments
but for the rest, financial advisors often advise taking some well-informed risks.
Initiatives such as this can give women the economic skills and knowledge they need
for a comfortable, independent retirement.
The increasing proportion of elderly women in the population...

1218,Cam5 - Test 2 - Part 1,B1,cam5---test-2---part-1,92,"Good morning, North College Library.
How can I help you?
I was wondering if it was possible to join the library.
Are you a student at North College?
No, I'm not, but someone told me it was possible to join, even if I wasn't.
That's right, it is.
Are you over 18?
That's our minimum joining age.
Yes, I am.
That's no problem then.
Could you tell me what I have to do to join?
Well, you'll need to come in to the library and fill out some forms.
You'll also need to bring two passport photos with you.
We also need two documents for ID, so a driving licence would be fine.
I've got that.
And what else? A credit card?
No, it needs to have your address on it.
Shall I bring a bank statement, would that do?
That'll be fine.
Good.
Does it cost anything to join?
Well, it's free for students here but otherwise it's ¬£125 per year
or ¬£25 if you've got a current student card from another college.
I was at Westerley College until last year but...
now I've got a job at Jefferson's steel factory.
Er, it's more expensive than I thought.
My local library is free.
But you'll find they don't have the range of reference books or facilities which we buy for our students.
That's why you have to pay to be an external member.
I see.
How many books can I borrow?
We allow twelve items borrowed at any one time if you're a student,
and that includes CDs, DVDs and videos.
However, it's only eight items for members of the public.
Fine.
And how long can I have them for?
Well, you can have both fiction and reference books for four weeks
which isn't bad really.
And what happens if I return them late?
Like all libraries, there's a fine system in place.
The minimum fine is ¬£1.50
but it can be much higher for some items - up to ¬£5 per week.
We'll give you a booklet with all the details when you join.
You can always renew items if they're not required by anyone else
by telephoning or logging on to our website.
What about the computers?
Can I use them free of charge?
For college students it's free, but for external members like yourself,
the first hour is free
and then we make a nominal charge of ¬£1 per hour thereafter.
Do I have to book in advance for them?
Oh, yes, it's advisable.
Most people tend to book twenty-four hours in advance
although sometimes you can get one with only six hours' notice.
However, the earliest you can book a computer is forty-eight hours before you need it,
and you can only book one hour at a time.
If no-one else has booked the computer out,
then you may be able to have another hour if you want.
We have a wide range of databases,
so the computers are in great demand.
I'm thinking of doing some writing
and I might need to access national newspapers.
Do you have them on these databases?
We do indeed.
We've got all the big nationals, The Guardian and The Observer, The Independent...
and The Times and Sunday Times.
We've also got all the local papers
and a wide selection of magazines.
Excellent.
I assume you have photocopying facilities?
Of course.
5p a sheet for both A4 and A3 black-and-white copies
and 40p a sheet for colour.
You can get a card from the counter here - it doesn't take coins.
Okay.
Oh by the way, another thing I was wondering about was
if you ran any writing classes through the library?
We do, but you'll have to speak to John Grantingham about that.
He's our resident author.
He runs the creative writing classes.
John... Grant.... Could you spell that for me please?
Certainly.
GRANTINGHAM.
Are the classes here at the library?
Yes - he's here on Thursday evenings.
No, sorry, Friday - he's just changed it.
You can contact him by emailing the library.
Okay.
Right, well that's about all I need to know.
Thank you.
I'll be along later this week to join.
Thanks. Bye.

1219,Cam5 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam5---test-2---part-2,76,"My name's Dan Pearman
and I'd like to talk about the work of Pedal Power,
a small charity based mainly in the UK.
I'll be giving our contact details at the end,
if anyone would like to find out more about how to support us.
But first, how the charity began.
I got the idea of exporting bicycles to developing countries while I was in Ecuador.
I went there in 1993 just after graduating from university.
After three years of studying, I wanted adventure.
I loved travelling,
so I decided to join a voluntary organisation
and was sent to Ecuador to carry out land surveys.
The project came to an end after five years
and when I returned to the UK in 1998,
I started planning Pedal Power.
Where I lived in Ecuador was a very rural area.
My neighbour had the only bicycle in the village,
whereas everyone else walked everywhere.
My neighbour's business was unusually successful,
and for years I couldn't understand why.
Then I realised having a bike meant he could get where he wanted to go without much trouble.
Other local carpenters could only accept jobs in a 3 kilometre radius,
so no matter how skilled they were, they could never do as many jobs as my neighbour.
At Pedal Power, we collect second-hand bikes in the UK
and send them to some of the poorest regions in the world.
When we distribute bikes overseas, we don't give them away for free.
We'd like to, but long term that doesn't really help the local economy.
The demand for bikes is enormous, which makes them very expensive locally.
So we sell them for 5% of the normal price.
But in order to continue operating,
we need to have a constant supply of bikes which we send out every six months.
One example of a town that's received bicycles from Pedal Power is Rivas.
It was the first place I sent a full container of bicycles to.
Most people there now own a bicycle.
The local economy has developed so much,
you wouldn't recognise it as the same place.
In fact, there are more bikes than on the streets of Amsterdam, if you've ever been there.
But Pedal Power still needs your help.
You may have read about some of our recent problems in the British media.
In August 2000, we simply ran out of money.
We had containers of bikes ready to send,
but no money to pay the bills.
It was a terrible situation.
We managed to ensure the bikes went out on time,
but the other problems carried on for several months.
Fortunately, in October 2001,
we won an Enterprise Award which helped us enormously.
We invested 15 of the 75,000 pound prize money to help secure our future.
Winning the award helped raise our profile,
and the money enabled us to pay all our shipping costs,
which represent our greatest expense.
Pedal Power changes lives -
when someone gets a bicycle from us, they see a 14% increase in their income.
We're currently looking to invest in computers
so that our office staff can do an even better job.
Because of our work, people in a number of countries now have a better standard of living -
so far we've provided 46,000 people with bikes.
But we'd like to send more, at least 50,000 by the end of the year.
Now there are many ways in which you can support the work of Pedal Power,
not just by taking a bike to a collection in your area.
I should also like to say if you do have a bike to donate,
it doesn't matter what condition it's in.
If we can't repair it, we'll strip it down for spare parts.
Of course, to do that we always need tools, which are expensive to buy,
so we welcome any that you can give.
Also, you could help by contacting the voluntary staff at our offices,
they'll be able to suggest activities you could organise to bring in funds for us.
People do all kinds of things - including, of course, sponsored bike rides.
Also, we're always interested to hear of other places that would benefit from receiving a consignment of bikes,
and welcome suggestions from people who've been to developing regions on their travels.
We hope that by talking on radio programmes like this,
we will be able to raise public awareness,
which will lead to government organisations also giving us regular financial support,
something that we really need.
If you'd like some more information about where to donate an old bicycle
or offer help in other ways, please contact...

1220,Cam5 - Test 2 - Part 3,B1,cam5---test-2---part-3,84,"First of all I'd just like to say, Cristina and Ibrahim,
that I really enjoyed watching your video about student life last week,
and I could see that the rest of the group did too.
You did really well, and I hope that you got a lot out of it.
I'd like to use this tutorial as a feedback session,
where you reflect on the experience of doing the project.
So Cristina, I was wondering, what did you enjoy most about making the video?
I liked using the camera.
Is it the first time you've operated one like that?
Yes, it is.
Well the results were very good!
Anything else?
I also enjoyed visiting one of the British students we filmed.
I'd never been inside a British home before.
Okay Cristina, thanks.
What about you, Ibrahim?
What did you enjoy?
Well, for me it was a very good chance to get to know students who are on other courses,
because everyone in our group is studying English, and...
we don't usually have much to do with the rest of the college.
Yes, good.
Do you think you'll maintain the contact now?
I hope so.
I've invited three of them to have dinner with me next week.
Great!
If you haven't decided what to make yet, I can tell you they'll love trying Arab dishes.
And of course, it's good for your English too.
Cristina, what did you find?
What was the most useful aspect of the project from the point of view of the English practice?
I think, when we were being shown how to edit the film,
we had to follow the instructions.
And that was very good practice for me.
And I also learned some technical words that I hadn't heard before.
What about you Ibrahim?
What was the most useful for your English?
It was listening to the British students,
because they don't speak as slowly as most of the tutors on our course.
I think they speak at natural speed,
so it forces me to get used to it.
And they use a lot of slang.
So you learned some new words which will be useful?
Yes.
Good.
I'm glad it helped.
Well, we've talked a little bit about enjoyment, and about language practice.
Were there any other benefits?
What else did you feel you'd learnt from the project?
Was it useful in other ways?
Yes, well firstly, I learned how to use a video camera.
And also, I think I really learned a lot about working together with other people.
I've never done anything with a group before,
and we had to find ways of cooperating,
erm, and compromising,
and sometimes persuading people, when they don't agree with you.
Yes, that is a very useful experience, I know.
What about you, Ibrahim?
Well, I think I learnt a lot about how important editing is.
When you're filming, you think that everything's going to be interesting,
but in fact we cut around half of it in the end,
and then it was much better.
Good.
Well, one last thing I'd like to ask.
What mistakes do you think you, as a group that is, made?
I mean, to put it another way, if you had to do it all over again,
is there anything you'd do differently?
We didn't plan very well.
For example, we didn't decide on dates when we'd complete each separate step of the project,
and we should have agreed about that in the beginning,
because we were always late with everything!
Right.
Anything else?
I think we should have tried to experiment more with the camera.
I mean with angles, and the focus and that kind of thing.
So you should have been more ambitious?
Do you agree, Ibrahim?
Not really.
In fact, I think we were too ambitious.
We were inexperienced, and we didn't have a lot of time,
and we tried to do too much, to make a long film.
Next time I would make a shorter one and try to get the quality better.
Well, that's very interesting.
Next semester we will be doing another video project - with a different content, of course -
but you'll have an opportunity to put into practice what you've learnt this time.
Do you have any ideas about...

1221,Cam5 - Test 2 - Part 4,C2,cam5---test-2---part-4,77,"Tonight I'm going to talk to you about that remarkable continent Antarctica -
remote, hostile and at present uninhabited on a permanent basis.
For early explorers, it was the ultimate survival contest;
for researchers like me, it remains a place of great intellectual challenge;
while for the modern tourist, it's simply a wilderness of great beauty.
First, some facts and figures.
Antarctica is a place of extremes
- the highest, coldest and windiest continent
and over 58 times the size of the UK.
The ice-cap contains almost 70% of the world's fresh water and 90% of its ice,
but with very low snowfall,
most of the continent technically falls unbelievably into the category of ""desert""!
Huge icebergs break off the continent each year,
while in winter half the surrounding ocean freezes over,
which means its size almost doubles.
Research and exploration has been going on in Antarctica for more than 200 years,
and has involved scientists from many different countries,
who work together on research stations.
Here science and technical support have been integrated in a very cost-effective way -
our Antarctic research programme has several summers-only stations
and two all-year-round ones;
I was based on one of the all-year-round ones.
The research stations are really self-contained communities of about 20 people.
There's living and working space,
a kitchen with a huge food store,
a small hospital
and a well-equipped gym to ensure everyone keeps fit in their spare time.
The station generates its own electricity
and communicates with the outside world using a satellite link.
Our station - Zero One - had some special features.
It wasn't built on land but on an ice-shelf, hundreds of metres thick.
Supplies were brought to us on large sledges
from a ship 15 kilometres away at the ice edge.
Living in the Antarctic hasn't always been so comfortable.
Snow build-ups caused enormous problems for four previous stations on the same site,
which were buried and finally crushed by the weight.
Fortunately no one was hurt,
but these buildings became a huge challenge to architects
who finally came up with a remarkable solution -
the buildings are placed on platforms
which can be raised above the changing snow level on legs which are extendable.
Food is one of the most important aspects of survival in a polar climate.
People living there need to obtain a lot more energy from their food,
both to keep warm and to undertake heavy physical work.
Maybe you know that an adult in the UK
will probably need about 1,700 kilocalories a day on average;
someone in Antarctica will need about 3.500 -
just over double!
This energy is provided by foods which are high in carbohydrate and fat.
Rations for fieldwork present an additional problem.
They need to provide maximum energy,
but they must also be compact and light for easy transport.
Special boxes are prepared,
each containing enough food for one person for twenty days.
You may be familiar with coffee processed by freeze-drying,
which preserves the quality of the food product while making a large saving in weight -
well, this type of presentation is ideal in our situation.
It wasn't available to earlier polar explorers,
whose diet was commonly insufficient for their health.
I think that being at the cutting edge of science has a special appeal for everyone working in Antarctica,
in whatever capacity.
As a marine biologist, my own research was fascinating;
but it's perhaps climate change research that is the most crucial field of study.
Within this general field,
surveying changes in the volume and stability of the ice-cap is vital,
since these may have profound effects on world sea levels and on ocean currents.
A second important area is monitoring the size of the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica,
since this is an indicator of global ultra-violet radiation levels.
Thirdly, bubbles in the ice-sheet itself provide an index of pollution
because frozen inside them are samples of previous atmospheres over the past 500,000 years,
and these provide us with evidence for the effects of such human activities as agriculture and industry.
There are an increasing number of opportunities for young people to work for a period in Antarctica -
not only as research assistants in projects like mine,
but also in a wide range of junior administrative and technical positions
including vacancies for map-makers.
I hope that the insights I've provided
will encourage you to take up these opportunities in this fascinating continent.

1222,Cam5 - Test 3 - Part 1,B1,cam5---test-3---part-1,99,"Good morning, please take a seat.
How can I help you?
Well, I'm thinking of buying a new car and I'd like some advice.
Sure, yes.
Had you got any particular make in mind?
I'm interested in a Lida,
I've had one before and liked it but haven't really made up my mind.
Sure. We've got various models.
Umm, right.
What about the engine size? Any ideas?
Er... the one I've got at the moment's a 1.2 litre engine but
I find it a bit slow on long journeys.
I'd like a bit more power this time...
a 1.4 should do,
I don't think I need a 1.6 or anything.
Right.
Well, I think the model you're looking at is the Max.
Here's a picture.
Oh, yes...
have you got one in?
Yes.
I'll take you to have a look at it in a minute.
I'll just get a few more details.
Is there anything else to do with the engine?
What kind of gear change do you want?
I presume you'd want a manual?
I'd want automatic -
I've never driven a car with manual gears.
Right.
Well now, here's the colour chart for the Max.
Have you given that any thought?
This blue's very popular at the moment.
Yes, it is nice, I like blue.
Erm... what's it called? 'Royal'?
Yes.
But actually, I think I prefer this lighter shade here - 'Sky'.
Yes, that's popular too.
I think I'll go for that.
You might have to wait a week or so for that colour,
but I assume that'd be okay?
Oh yes, fine.
Well, we can go outside and you can have a good look at one,
and perhaps take it out.
But first, can I just ask you about finance?
The cash price is going to be somewhere in the region of 7500.
How would you like to pay?
Are you in a position to pay cash, or would you need credit?
I'd like credit provided the terms are reasonable.
Well you can discuss that with my colleague in a moment;
we have various arrangements.
And would you be interested in us taking your present car as part exchange?
Yes.
Okay, fine.
So I'll just need some details from you and then we can do a valuation...
Is that okay?
Fine, yes.
Could I have your full name?
Wendy Harries,
that's HARRIES.
And is that Mrs..?. Miss...? Ms...?
It's Doctor, actually.
Oh, right.
And your address?
20 Green Banks.
Is that 'Green' spelled as in the colour?
Yes, that's right.
Okay.
Alton.
Is that OLTON?
Not quite, it begins with an A, not an O.
Oh yes, that's in Hampshire isn't it?
That's right.
And do you know your postcode?
Yes. It's GU89EW.
Do you have a daytime phone number?
Well, I work at a hospital but it's a bit difficult to get hold of me.
I can give you a number just for messages,
and then I'll get back to you when I can. Is that okay?
That's fine.
It's 0798257643.
Fine.
And about the car you have now, what make is it?
It's a Conti.
Do you know the year or the model name?
I think it's 1996, and it's called a Lion - like the animal.
Then it must be 1994, because they brought out the Fox after that.
Oh right, yes.
Mileage? Roughly?
I'm not sure.
I know it's less than 70,000.
Okay.
What colour is it?
It's grey, metallic grey.
Right, and one last thing -
what sort of condition would you say it's in?
I'd probably describe it as reasonable.
Do you need to see it? It's parked outside.
Not at the moment, no.
Perhaps you could call in one day next week...

1223,Cam5 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam5---test-3---part-2,93,"As I said earlier,
there is, I think, at Rexford, an excellent combination of physical and geographical advantages -
as well as having a rural setting and still being close to central London,
something that will certainly be of interest to you
is that Rexford is just 35 minutes from London Airport.
At Rexford we have a strong research capability.
We came 7th out of 101 universities in last year's research assessment,
carried out by a government body
and did particularly well in your particular subjects, engineering and science.
Actually we got a top research grade of five for engineering, geography and computer sciences.
One further point - and I know from talking to you individually
that a number of you may be looking for some experience in industry after the course -
is that all our science and engineering research departments
have unusually close relationships with industry in the area.
Anyway, that's enough sales talk from me...
I'll just take a sip of this coffee that's just arrived, thank you,
and then I'll say something about what actually happens when you apply.
Right... Now if you do decide to make an application,
what you do is send it directly to me in my department.
I will then immediately send confirmation and the application process begins.
I'd like to say at this point that you shouldn't worry if this process doesn't work all that quickly -
I mean occasionally there are postal problems,
but most often, the hold-up is caused by references -
the people you give as referees,
shall we say, take their time to reply.
Anyway, it's absolutely normal for this process to take three to four months.
What I do in this period is keep in touch with you
and reassure you that things are moving along.
One of the ways we've devised to help you decide about applying
as well as later when you've been accepted... hopefully...
is to put you in contact with, if possible, a student from your own country
who is at present studying with us.
What you can do is phone them up -
we will, of course, liaise between you
and discuss your concerns with them.
That way you can get an objective opinion of what you can expect
if you come to live and study at Rexford -
not only the academic atmosphere
but important details like what the leisure facilities are like
and whether the English weather and food are really as awful as everybody says!
If you decide you can face it,
the contact can also help you just before you leave,
with tips on what to pack and that sort of thing.
At the moment I think we've got two second-year students
and one postgraduate from this country.
Now to move on to the other concerns you expressed earlier.
At a UK university - as I'm sure you know -
you will be in an environment where independent learning is the norm,
which takes most students a while to adjust to,
and at a time when you will be separated from your normal surroundings
and, in most cases, your family.
This can be a difficult time.
But remember that something like 25% of our student body
are international students like yourselves,
and that there are several organisations in the university and city
whose main purpose is to offer help
and ensure that your time with us is enjoyable and useful.
One or two of you touched on the subject of accommodation earlier.
So I'll just add a few points:
it is the University's policy to give priority in the allocation of residence places to three categories,
and those are: visiting students, exchange students and new postgraduate students.
However, demand exceeds supply,
so there is still a need to put your name down early for campus accommodation,
particularly if your family is accompanying you.
This means that the earlier you decide whether you want to study with us...
and so get the procedure moving, the better it will be for everybody.
Erm... Yes?
What if you would prefer to live outside the university?
If you're planning to live off-campus, you've got to sort things out even earlier.
As with everything in short supply,
the good accommodation gets snapped up months before the beginning of term -
in other words, if you're starting in October,
you need to be thinking about it in June or at the very latest July,
So you do need to think very carefully about what you need,
how much you can afford to pay, well in advance.
What you can't do is leave it until a few days before the start of term.
The agencies in town are pretty good -
it's just a matter of contacting them in good time.
Of course, we have a full-time accommodation officer available to help all students.
She'll get in touch with you when you're accepted -
she's got plenty of contacts in the town and will deal with the agencies on your behalf.
One or two of you asked me earlier about your level of spoken English.
Obviously most of you have already achieved a lot -
I wish I could speak your language half as well.
Having said that though,
I'm afraid the lecturers will make little or no allowance for the presence of non-native speakers in the audience.
So, anything you can do to improve your spoken English -
even beyond the pretty high levels most of you have already reached -
will help make your stay with us that bit more fun for you.
Some extra practice before you arrive is worth more than...
for example private lessons afterwards, when you won't really have time.
Oh... and one last thing before I invite further questions:
it's very important...

Did you do it?
The course feedback form?
Yes.
If you want, we can do it together,
I've got mine here.
Is that OK?
Yeah.
Okay, let's have a look then.
What do we have to do?
Let's fill in the top first,
let's see, Course, Course code...
Er, it's Communication in Business.
Okay, Communication... in.. Business.
I do know that, but what's the code?
CB16 something,
CB162, isn't it?
Mmm, that's it. Okay and dates.
When did we start?
I remember, my birthday's on May 4th and it was the day after,
it must have been May 5th.
Gosh, doesn't seem that long ago, does it?
No, and we finish at the end of this week, on Friday, so that's...
July 15th?
Er 16th, Monday was the 12th.
Right, that was the easy bit, now let's have a look -
""Please give your comments on the following aspects of the course"".
Okay, what's the first one?
Oh, course organisation.
What do you think?
Er, clear?
It was, wasn't it?
Yes, I think the organisation was clear.
Okay, anything else for course organisation?
Erm... It was a good thing he gave us the course outline at the beginning, in the first session,
that was useful, so I'll put that down, shall I?
Yeah.
Now, going on to suggestions for improvement,
one thing that wasn't so good,
I think we could have done a bit more work at the beginning,
I mean at the beginning it seemed dead easy.
I thought it was going to be really easy
and then all of a sudden in the second half of the course, we got a whole load of work,
reading to do and essays and things.
Yeah, it'd be better if it was more even.
Okay, now course delivery,
does that mean teaching?
Yeah, I suppose so.
Well, what I thought was really good on this course was the standard of teaching.
Actually - I mean some of the teachers were better than others -
but the standard generally was fine.
Much better than other courses I've been on.
Yeah, I agree. Let's put that then.
What about suggestions for improvement?
I didn't think it was all that wonderful when we had great long group discussion sessions that went on for hours and hours.
I don't mean we shouldn't have group discussions,
just that they shouldn't go on too long.
Now, on to materials and equipment.
Oh, now what was good about some sessions was the handouts.
Yes, I thought all the handouts were good actually, and some were great, with website addresses and everything.
One problem though with materials was the key texts.
Yes!
There just weren't enough copies on reserve in the library.
And if you can't get the key texts before the session,
how are you supposed to do the reading?
And not enough computers.
You have to wait ages to get one.
OK, testing and evaluation.
Well, I don't know, it's hard to say until we've got our written assignments back.
Don't talk about it,
I only got mine in yesterday, it was a real struggle.
I hate to think what mark I'll get.
Yeah, but at least we've done the oral presentation.
I thought that was good, the way I got my feedback really quickly.
Yes, it was.
And I liked the way we knew what we'd be evaluated on,
we knew the criteria, so we knew we had to think about clarity, organisation, and so on.
But I'm not so sure about the written work.
One thing I think is that there's just too much, it's really stressful.
Oh yes, I'd agree
and I don't see why they can't let us know the criteria they use for marking.
The written assignments?
But he told us.
No, for the final exams.
What are they looking for - what are the criteria?
What makes a pass or a fail?
Yeah, I never thought of that.
It'd be really useful.
Okay, any other comments?
I thought student support was excellent.
Yeah, me too.
Okay, excellent.
Other comments?
No. I can't think of anything else.
Nor me.
Okay, so that's done.

No, thank you.

1225,Cam5 - Test 3 - Part 4,B2,cam5---test-3---part-4,64,"Well, my group has been doing a project on how household waste is recycled in Britain.
We were quite shocked to discover that only 9% of people here in the UK
make an effort to recycle their household waste.
This is a lower figure than in most other European countries,
and needs to increase dramatically in the next few years
if the government is going to meet its recycling targets.
The agreed targets for the UK mean that by 2008 we must reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by 12.5%,
compared with 1990.
And recycling can help to achieve that goal, in two main ways:
the production of recycled glass and paper uses much less energy than producing them from virgin materials,
and also recycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions from landfill sites and incineration plants.
As part of our project,
we carried out a survey of people in the street,
and the thing that came up over and over again
is that people don't think it's easy enough to recycle their waste.
One problem is that there aren't enough 'drop- off' sites,
that is, the places where the public are supposed to take their waste.
We also discovered that waste that's collected from householders
is taken to places called 'bring banks', for sorting and baling into loads.
One problem here is taking out everything that shouldn't have been placed in the recycling containers:
people put all sorts of things into bottle banks, like plastic bags and even broken umbrellas.
All this has to be removed by hand.
Another difficulty is that toughened glass used for cooking doesn't fully melt at the temperature required for other glass,
and so that also has to be picked out by hand.
Glass is easy to recycle because it can be reused over and over again without becoming weaker.
Two million tons of glass is thrown away each year,
that is, seven billion bottles and jars;
but only 500,000 tons of that is collected and recycled.
Oddly enough, half the glass that's collected is green,
and a lot of that is imported,
so more green glass is recycled than the UK needs.
As a result, new uses are being developed for recycled glass, particularly green glass,
for example, in fibreglass manufacture and water filtration.
A company called CLF Aggregates makes a product for roads,
and 30% of the material is crushed glass.
For recycling paper, Britain comes second in Europe with 40%,
behind Germany's amazing 70%.
When recycling started, there were quality problems,
so it was difficult to use recycled paper in office printers.
But these problems have now been solved,
and Martin's, based in South London,
produces a range of office stationery which is 100% recycled,
costs the same as normal paper and is of equally high quality.
But this high quality comes at a cost in terms of the waste produced during the process.
Over a third of the waste paper that comes in can't be used in the recycled paper,
leaving the question of what to do with it.
One firm, Papersave, currently sells this to farmers as a soil conditioner,
though this practice will soon be banned because of transport costs and the smell,
and the company is looking into the possibility of alternative uses.
Plastic causes problems, because there are so many different types of plastic in use today,
and each one has to be dealt with differently.
Pacrite recycles all sorts of things, from bottles to car bumpers,
and one of its most successful activities is recycling plastic bottles to make containers
which are used all over the country to collect waste.
The Save-a-Cup scheme was set up by the vending and plastics industries
to recycle as many as possible of the 3.5 billion polystyrene cups used each year.
At the moment, 500 million polycups are collected, processed and sold on to other businesses, such as Waterford,
which turns the cups into pencils,
and Johnson & Jones, a Welsh-based firm,
which has developed a wide variety of items, including business cards.
Well, to sum up,
there seems to be plenty of research going on into how to re-use materials,
but the biggest problem is getting people to think about recycling instead of throwing things away.
At least doing the research made us much more careful.

1226,Cam5 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam5---test-4---part-1,68,"Good morning, how can I help you?
Good morning.
I understand you help fix up students with host families.
That's right...
are you interested in...?
Well please sit down and I'll just take a few details.
Thank you.
Right, now... what name is it?
Jenny Chan.
Can you spell that please?
Yes...
JENNY
CHAN.
Right... and what is your present address?
Sea View Guest House, 14 Hill Road.
Okay, and do you know the phone number there?
Yes... I have it here...
2237676
but I'm only there after about 7 pm.
So when would be the best time to catch you?
I suppose between 9 and, let me see, half-past, before I leave for the college.
Great... and can I ask you your age?
I've just had my nineteenth birthday.
And how long would you want to stay with the host family?
I'm planning on staying a year
but at the moment I'm definitely here for four months only.
I have to get an extension to my permit.
You're working on it?
Fine...
and what will be your occupation while you're in the UK?
Studying English?
And what would you say your level of English is?
Good, I think.
I'd like to say 'advanced' but my written work is below the level of my spoken,
so I suppose it's intermediate.
Certainly your spoken English is advanced.
Anyway, which area do you think you would prefer?
Well, I'm studying right in the centre
but I'd really like to live in the north-west.
That shouldn't be a great problem...
we usually have lots of families up there...
And do you have any particular requirements for diet?
Well, I'm nearly a vegetarian... not quite.
Shall I say you are? It's probably easier that way.
That would be best.
Anything about your actual room?
I would prefer my own facilities - 'en suite', is that right?
And also if it's possible, a TV
and I'd also like the house to have a real garden rather than just a yard,
somewhere I could sit and be peaceful.
Is that all?
Well... I'm really serious about improving my English
so I'd prefer to be the only guest if that's possible?
No other guests...
Yes, you get more practice that way.
Anyway, obviously all this is partly dependent on how much you're willing to pay.
What did you have in mind?
I was thinking in terms of about ¬£60 to ¬£80 a week,
but I'd go up to a hundred if it was something special.
Well, I don't think we'd have any problems finding something for you.
Oh, good.
And when would you want it for?
I'd like to move in approximately two weeks.
Let me see, it's the 10th today...
so if we go for the Monday it's the 23rd of March.
Yes.
Right...
good, and if I could ask one last question...

1227,Cam5 - Test 4 - Part 2,B1,cam5---test-4---part-2,41,"Good evening everyone
and thank you for coming to the Soccer Club meeting.
It's good to see so many parents and children here tonight,
and I know you're looking forward to a great football season.
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to tell you about some changes to the Soccer Club for the coming season.
Now, this season we'll be playing all our matches for both the junior and senior competitions at King's Park,
instead of Royal Park, which was used last season.
Now, for meetings, we're going to use the clubhouse in King's Park,
and the next meeting will be held in the clubhouse on the 2nd of July.
As usual, we hope to begin the season with a picnic next Saturday at the clubhouse.
Please try and come to the picnic as it's always good fun.
In the last week of the season, we usually have a dinner and presentation of prizes to the players,
and more information about this will be given to you later in the season.
This season we have more teams than ever.
We hope to have ten teams, instead of five, in the junior competition
and they will play on Saturday mornings, beginning at 8.30 a.m.
Training sessions will be held in King's Park on Wednesday afternoons for the juniors
and they will be wearing red shirts again this year.
In the senior competition, there'll be four teams, same as last year,
and their games will be played on Saturday afternoons starting at 2.30,
oh, no sorry, it will be a 2 o'clock start,
and the training session for seniors is planned for Sunday afternoons.
Now I'd like to introduce you to the new committee for the Soccer Club for this season.
Firstly, let me welcome Robert Young, the new President,
who will manage the meetings for the next two years.
Robert's son has been playing football with the club for over five years now,
and many thanks to Robert for taking on the job of President.
Next we have Gina Costello, she's the treasurer,
and she'll collect the fees from you for the season.
Please try and give Gina your fees as early as possible in the season,
as the club needs the money to buy some new equipment.
Then there's David West who has volunteered to be the club secretary,
and one of the many jobs he'll have is to send out newsletters to you regularly.
If you have any information that may be useful,
please let David know so that it can be included in these newsletters.
Also, I'd like to introduce you to Jason Dokic who is the Head Coach.
For all the new members here tonight, this is the third year that Jason has been with us as Head Coach,
and we're very lucky to have such an experienced coach and former player at our club.
He will continue to supervise the teams, at training sessions and on match days.
Now, before we finish and have some refreshments,
does anyone have any questions they'd like to ask the new committee?
",https://dailydictation.com/upload/ielts-listening/ielts-cambridge-5-test-4-part-2-2023-08-09-22-34-30/0-ielts-cambridge-5-test-4-part-2.mp3,4,65
1228,Cam5 - Test 4 - Part 3,C1,cam5---test-4---part-3,82,"Right, Jason and Karin,
now I asked you to look at the case study for Box Telecom as part of your exam assessment.
It's interesting because they are in the middle of problems at the moment
and I want you to track how they deal with them.
Let's start with you, Karin.
Having read through the case study,
can you just summarise what the problems were that Box Telecom had to take on board?
Um, yeah...
Well of course what first came to their attention was that, despite a new advertising campaign,
they were suffering from falling sales -
and this is something that had many causes.
On top of that immediate problem,
what had also happened over the last two years was that,
although they had invested in an expansion plan,
they had to face up to increased competition.
And, before they had a chance to get to grips with the effects of that,
they were stalled by a strike
and it was just when they were thinking about making a colossal investment in new machinery for their plants.
So they were really in trouble.
Yes, I think that's fair.
And Jason, you contacted the company, didn't you?
What did the company define as the reasons for these problems?
Well, I think they've hit on the right things -
it would be easy to say they had invested too heavily, or at the wrong time,
but in fact, the signs were good
and what they were set back by was high interest rates.
At the same time, their longer-term problems, which were affecting their market share,
were eventually credited to poor training -
and having looked at the details in their last report I think that's right.
So, onto the larger issues then.
Karin, what do you think the company will do?
Obviously they have the choice of accepting the very favourable terms that another company - KMG Plc - have given them to buy them out.
That would mean creating a new company with a new image.
Or they could decide on a bolder move and offer some new shares if they wanted.
But I think they're much more cautious than that
and expect they will start trying to find individuals who'd be prepared to back them with some of the capital they need.
Well, you mustn't always assume that dramatic problems require dramatic solutions.
Sometimes there's a simple fix such as changing the guy at the top.
If they truly are cautious,
then I suspect they will seek to shut down some of their shops.
But a more ambitious approach,
and one which I think would have more chance of success,
would be to alter how they're running things -
the management layers and the processes.
So, in your analysis, try to think of all the options.
Jason?
Yes, it's interesting because I've found it a really useful company to study.
Its problems cross all types of industries
and it's lucky it's so big -
a smaller or even medium-sized company would have gone under by now.
Ah well in fact, what I want you two to do
is to go away when we've finished our discussion today and write a report.
We've looked in general at the telecommunications market in the UK over the last few sessions
and I want you to take Box Telecom as an example
and suggest some ways in which they might overcome their problems.
And outline the reasons why you think as you do -
but try and keep it intrinsic to the company
rather than dragging in other examples.
Is that okay, Karin?
Yes, I think I can do that.
Personally I've got great hopes for it.
I think it will recover.
That advertising campaign they did was very strong
and they're very innovative with their products - they set new trends.
The company's got to recover, don't you think, Jason?
Hmm... I'm not sure.
I think it can but it's not a foregone conclusion
unless they manage to attract the right level of investment.
The company definitely needs a boost
and to attract more highly skilled workers if their recovery is to be long-lasting.
When I was talking to the marketing manager
he said to me that he thinks the company had got a great management team
but he would say that, wouldn't he?
but they are suffering from having to work with outdated production machinery
and that could cost a lot to put right.
Well, personally I think the stock market is to blame.
I think they were expecting too much of the company
and then inevitably it looked bad when it didn't perform.
The market should have had more realistic expectations.
And I disagree with you about the advertising campaign, Karin.
That's where they could do with some innovation - to get sales kick-started.
Anyway, let's see what you come up with...
",https://dailydictation.com/upload/ielts-listening/ielts-cambridge-5-test-4-part-3-2023-08-09-22-34-54/0-ielts-cambridge-5-test-4-part-3.mp3,4,65
1229,Cam5 - Test 4 - Part 4,B2,cam5---test-4---part-4,64,"Okay, are you all settled?
Well, first of all, welcome to Cardiff University.
I'm here to explain what we can offer you.
Now, as a new student at the university,
you will probably need some sort of guidance to help you to use the library effectively
to study and research.
Some of you have asked about a guided tour
but we find this rather muddles people.
So, in this first week,
we run a series of talks which focus on different aspects of the library and its resources.
You'll also find that to get the most out of the library,
you really do need to be computer literate
and so, all this term we run small classes
which will bring you up to speed on how to access the computer-loaded information.
Okay, now let me give you an outline of what's available to you.
You'll find that the computers are increasingly used as a research tool.
Many students do most of their research on the internet
and the library computers are permanently online.
Having found what you need, you'll find you can readily save texts on your personal computer space to print off when you need.
You might think that it is the fastest way to get information but the links can be slow.
Clearly, you can find lots on there but much of it is useless information
as it is from highly debatable sources - so be critical.
You'll also find that the library has loaded several CD-ROMS onto the computers from specialist reference sources
such as the MLA.
It means we can expand what we offer you at very little extra cost
and saves us having to invest in more and more books.
The CD-ROMS contain exactly the same information as the reference books
as the two are updated together.
Now most of you will need to refer to journal articles in your work
and you'll find you can also access these online
and we encourage you to do so.
Clearly some of you will find the printed version more accessible as it sits on the shelves
but I'm afraid the intention is to phase these out eventually.
However, you will still be able to print off a version of the text rather than photocopying the journal pages.
So you must get used to working online.
Naturally we do still have the full range of classic reference books,
additional to the CD-ROMS, for you to use
and there are several copies of each one.
This is because some of you may prefer to borrow a book rather than sit in the library.
There is a restricted loan time on these
so that they are not missing from the shelves for too long.
Although there is a Section Manager for each part of the library,
they are very busy
and so, if you do get stuck looking for things,
you should ask the relevant Cataloguing Assistant.
As your Training Supervisor, I just oversee your induction
and will not be around after this initial week.
Some of you may be interested to know that the library is offering specialised training sessions on writing a dissertation.
Obviously, this is not relevant to those of you who are undergraduates;
it is just for postgraduates.
Your department will discuss the planning stage of the dissertation -
i.e. what you're going to do with you
and we will focus on the structure of it.
However, the training will also include some time on the computers.
I realise most of you know how to organise files
but we can show you the different ways to run data programmes.
Your tutors will tell you at the outset how to set out the chapters they require
but you will need to ask them how they would like you to organise the bibliography
because it varies depending on your subject area.
When you've got something together, the trainer here will look through the draft version for you to see if it's okay.
And, one final point,
for those of you who have registered from abroad,
we can offer individual sessions on dissertations if you feel you need them.
If you require language lessons then they are available from the International Centre next to the Law Department.

1230,Cam4 - Test 1 - Part 1,B1,cam4---test-1---part-1,79,"Good morning.
Good morning.
How can I help you?
I understand that the school organises... um, trips to different...
Yes, we run five every month:
three during weekends and two Wednesday afternoon trips.
What sort of places?
Well, obviously it varies,
but always places of historical interest
and also which offer a variety of shopping, because our students always ask about that...
and then we go for ones where we know there are guided tours,
because this gives a good focus for the visit.
Do you travel far?
Well, we're lucky here, obviously,
because we're able to say that all our visits are less than three hours drive.
How much do they cost?
Again, it varies,
between five and fifteen pounds a head, depending on distance.
Oh, and we do offer to arrange special trips if, you know, there are more than twelve people.
Oh right, I'll keep that in mind.
And what are the times normally?
We try to keep it pretty fixed so that, that students get to know the pattern.
We leave at 8.30 a.m. and return at 6 p.m.
We figure it's best to keep the day fairly short.
Oh yes. And, um, how do we reserve a place?
You sign your name on the notice board.
Do you know where it is?
Ah ha. I saw it this morning.
And we do ask that you sign up three days in advance
so we know we've got enough people interested to run it,
and we can cancel if necessary, with full refund of course.
That's fine, thanks.
And what visits are planned for this term?
Right, well, I'm afraid the schedule hasn't been printed out yet,
but, uh... we have confirmed the dates and planned the optional extra visits
which you can also book in advance if you want to.
Oh that's all right.
If you can just give some idea of the weekend ones
so I can, you know, work out when to see friends, etcetera.
Oh sure.
Well, the first one is St Ives.
That's on the 13th of February
and we'll have only sixteen places available 'cos we're going by minibus.
And that's a day in town with the optional extra of visiting the Hepworth Museum.
Oh right... yeah... that sounds good.
Then there's a London trip on the sixteenth of February
and we'll be taking a medium-sized coach so there'll be 45 places on that,
and, let's see, the optional extra is the Tower of London.
Oh, I've already been there.
After that there's Bristol on the 3rd of March.
Where?
Bristol...
BRISTOL.
Okay...
That's in a different minibus with 18 places available,
oh, and the optional extra is a visit to the S.S. Great Britain.
Okay...
We're going to Salisbury on the eighteenth of March
and that's always a popular one because the optional extra is Stonehenge,
so we're taking the large coach with fifty seats...
Oh good.
And then the last one is to Bath on the 23rd of March.
Oh yes. Is Bath the Roman city?
Yes, that's right,
and that's in the sixteen-seater minibus.
And where's the optional visit?
It's to the American Museum - well worth a visit.
Okay, well that's great, thanks for all that...
My pleasure.
By the way, if you want more information about any of the trips,
have a look in the student newspaper.
Okay.
Or, have a word with my assistant;
her name is Jane Yentob -
that's YENTOB.
Right, I've got that.
Thank you very much for all your help.
You're very welcome.
I hope you enjoy the trips.

1231,Cam4 - Test 1 - Part 2,B1,cam4---test-1---part-2,67,"Good afternoon everybody
and welcome to Riverside Industrial Village.
To start your visit, I'm just going to give you a brief account of the history of the museum
before letting you roam about on your own.
I won't keep you long. Okay?
Now, from where we're standing
you've got a good view of the river over there.
And it was because of this fast-flowing water
that this site was a natural place for manufacturing works.
The water and the availability of raw materials in the area, like minerals and iron ore,
and also the abundance of local fuels, like coal and firewood,
all made this site suitable for industry from a very early time.
Water was the main source of power for the early industries
and some of the water wheels were first established in the 12th century, would you believe?
At that time, local craftsmen first built an iron forge
just behind the village here, on the bend in the river.
By the 17th and 18th centuries,
the region's rivers supported more than 160 water mills -
and many of these continued to operate well into the 19th century.
But then, the steam engine was invented
and then the railways came
and the centres of industry were able to move away from the rivers and the countryside and into the towns.
So, industrial villages like this one became very rare.
So, that's the history for you.
If you'd like any more information, you can ask me some questions,
or you can read further in our excellent guide book.
Now I'm going to give you a plan of the site
and I'd just like to point out where everything is
and then you can take a look at everything for yourself.
I've already pointed out the river, which is on the left.
And of course, running along the bottom is Woodside Road,
got it?
Okay.
Now, we're standing at the entrance,
see it at the bottom,
and immediately to our right is the Ticket Office.
You won't need that because you've got your group booking,
but just past it are the toilets -
always good to know where they are.
In front of us is the car park, as you can see,
and to the left, by the entry gate is the Gift Shop.
That's where you can get copies of the guide, like this one here.
Now, beyond the car park,
all the buildings are arranged in a half circle with a yard in the middle.
The big, stone building at the top is the main Workshop.
That's where the furnace is
and where all the metal was smelted and the tools were cast,
as you'll be able to see.
Now, in the top right-hand corner,
that building with bigger windows is the Showroom,
where samples of all the tools that were made through the ages are on display.
In the top left corner is the Grinding Shop,
where the tools were sharpened and finished.
And on one side of that you can see the Engine Room
and on the other is the Caf√©,
which isn't an antique, you'll be pleased to know,
though they do serve very nice old-fashioned teas.
The row of buildings you can see on the left are the cottages.
These were built for the workers towards the end of the 18th century
and they're still furnished from that period
so you can get a good idea of ordinary people's living conditions.
Across the yard from them,
you can see the stables where the horses were kept for transporting the products.
And the separate building in front of them is the Works Office
and that still has some of the old accounts on display.
Right, if anyone wants a guided tour then I'm starting at the Engine Room.
If you'd like to come along, this way please, ladies and gentlemen.

1232,Cam4 - Test 1 - Part 3,B2,cam4---test-1---part-3,88,"Excuse me, Dr Johnson.
May I speak to you for a minute?
Sure. Come in.
I'm Melanie Griffin.
I'm taking your course in Population Studies.
Right. Well, Melanie, how can I help you?
I'm having a bit of trouble with the second assignment,
and it's due in 12 days.
What sort of trouble are you having?
Is the assignment question a problem?
Well, that's part of the problem.
I'm also having - been having trouble getting hold of the books.
I've been to the library several times, and all the books are out.
Sounds like you should have started borrowing books a bit earlier.
Well, I had a really big assignment due in for another course, and...
I've been spending all my time on that, and I thought...
You might get an extension of time to finish your assignment for me?
If that's possible, but I don't know...
Well, yes, it is possible, but...
extensions are normally given only for medical or compassionate reasons,
otherwise, it's really a question of organising your study,
and we don't like giving extensions to students who simply didn't plan their work properly.
What did you get for your first assignment?
I got 87%.
Yes, you did very well indeed,
so obviously, you can produce good work.
I don't think I'll need too much extra time,
as long as I can get hold of some of the important references.
Well, since you did so well in your first assignment,
I'm prepared to give you an extra two weeks for this one,
so that'll mean you'll need to submit it about a month from now.
Thank you.
Now, what about the reading materials?
Have you checked out the journal articles in the list?
Umm, no, not yet,
there were about 20 of them, and...
I wasn't sure which ones would be most useful or important.
Well, they're all useful,
but I don't expect anyone to read them all, because a number of them deal with the same issues.
Let me give you some suggestions.
The article by Anderson and Hawker is really worth reading.
Right, I'll read that one.
You should also read the article by Jackson,
but just look at the part on the research methodology - how they did it.
Okay...
Jackson, got that...
And if you have time, the one by Roberts says very relevant things,
although it's not essential.
Okay, if it's useful, I'll try and read that one...
Now, the one by Morris.
I wouldn't bother with that at this stage, if I were you.
Okay, I won't bother with Morris.
Oh, now, someone told me the article by Cooper is important.
Well, yes, in a way,
but just look at the last part, where he discusses the research results.
And lastly, there's Forster -
I can't think why I included that one.
It's not bad and could be of some help, but not that much.
Now, let's deal with the assignment question.
What's the problem there?
It's the graph on page two.
What seems to be the problem? It's just the bar graph showing reasons why people change where they live.
Well, I've got a photocopy but the reasons at the bottom are missing.
Ah, okay.
Look at the first bar on the graph -
now that indicates the number of people who move because they want more space.
Oh I see...
bar one... okay...
Now what about the next bar?
Bar two is to do with the people living nearby disturbing them,
so they chose to move away to somewhere quieter.
Now let's look at bar number three...
another reason people change their place of living
is because they want to be closer to the city.
Okay.
Proximity to the city is an issue...
Now, bar number four refers to problems when the owner of the property won't help fix things that go wrong.
In other words, the owner is not helpful and so the tenants move out.
Okay...
Now what about bar five?
Bar five is about those people who move because...
they need a bus or train to get them into the city or to go to work.
Okay...
And bar six?
Bar number six is interesting.
That reason was given quite a lot -
people moving because they wanted to be in a more attractive neighbourhood.
Oh, yes, thank you very much.

1233,Cam4 - Test 1 - Part 4,B2,cam4---test-1---part-4,56,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen.
I have been asked today to talk to you about the urban landscape.
There are two major areas that I will focus on in my talk:
how vegetation can have a significant effect on urban climate,
and how we can better plan our cities using trees
to provide a more comfortable environment for us to live in.
Trees can have a significant impact on our cities.
They can make a city, as a whole, a bit less windy
or a bit more windy, if that's what you want.
They can make it a bit cooler if it's a hot summer day in an Australian city,
or they can make it a bit more humid if it's a dry inland city.
On the local scale - that is, in particular areas within the city -
trees can make the local area more shady, cooler,
more humid and much less windy.
In fact, trees and planting of various kinds
can be used to make city streets actually less dangerous in particular areas.
How do trees do all that, you ask?
Well, the main difference between a tree and a building
is a tree has got an internal mechanism to keep the temperature regulated.
It evaporates water through its leaves
and that means that the temperature of the leaves is never very far from our own body temperature.
The temperature of a building surface on a hot sunny day
can easily be twenty degrees more than our temperature.
Trees, on the other hand, remain cooler than buildings because they sweat.
This means that they can humidify the air and cool it -
a property which can be exploited to improve the local climate.
Trees can also help break the force of winds.
The reason that high buildings make it windier at ground level is that,
as the wind goes higher and higher, it goes faster and faster.
When the wind hits the building, it has to go somewhere.
Some of it goes over the top and some goes around the sides of the building,
forcing those high level winds down to ground level.
That doesn't happen when you have trees.
Trees filter the wind and considerably reduce it.
preventing those very large strong gusts
that you so often find around tall buildings.
Another problem in built-up areas
is that traffic noise is intensified by tall buildings.
By planting a belt of trees at the side of the road,
you can make things a little quieter,
but much of the vehicle noise still goes through the trees.
Trees can also help reduce the amount of noise in the surroundings,
although the effect is not as large as people like to think.
Low- frequency noise, in particular, just goes through the trees as though they aren't there.
Although trees can significantly improve the local climate,
they do however take up a lot of space.
There are root systems to consider
and branches blocking windows and so on.
It may therefore be difficult to fit trees into the local landscape.
There is not a great deal you can do if you have what we call a street canyon -
a whole set of high-rises enclosed in a narrow street.
Trees need water to grow.
They also need some sunlight to grow
and you need room to put them.
If you have the chance of knocking buildings down and replacing them,
then suddenly you can start looking at different ways to design the streets and to introduce...

1234,Cam4 - Test 2 - Part 1,B1,cam4---test-2---part-1,91,"Oh, Peter, there you are.
You've been ages. What kept you so long?
I'm sorry I'm so late, Sally.
Have you been waiting long?
Oh, half an hour.
But it doesn't matter.
I've had a coffee and I've been reading this guidebook for tourists.
Sit down.
You look very hot and tired.
What would you like to drink?
I'd love a really chilled mineral water or something.
Will you have another coffee?
Yes, I will.
The waitress will be back in a moment.
Why were you so late?
Did something happen?
Yes.
You know, I went to the bank to cash some travellers cheques?
Well, the exchange rate was looking healthy, but...
when I went to the teller, they told me the computer system was temporarily down,
so they couldn't do any transactions.
They said the problem would be fixed in a few minutes, so I waited.
And then I started talking to another guy in the bank,
and I forgot the time.
Oh, really?
Someone you met in the bank?
Does he work there?
No, he was a tourist, from New York.
His name's Henry,
and he's been here for a week, but he's moving on to Germany tomorrow.
He's an architect,
and he's spending four weeks travelling around Europe.
Just like us!
Yeah, just like us.
He told me the names of some places where we should eat.
Great food, and not too expensive, he said.
Oh, and he also gave me this map of the bus system.
He said he didn't need it any more.
That's useful.
Pity he's moving on tomorrow.
Ah, here's the waitress. Let's order.
Do you want anything to eat, or shall we just have a drink?
Well, I'm hungry,
and we've got a lot of sightseeing to do, so let's just have a snack and a drink.
Sounds good to me!
Well, let's decide what we'll see today.
I guess the best place to start is the Cathedral,
and then the Castle.
What are the opening times for those two?
Well, according to this guidebook,
the Cathedral is only open from 9:30 in the morning until midday.
No, hang on.
That's the Cathedral Museum.
The Cathedral itself is open morning and afternoon.
The Castle is just open from one to five,
so we can't go there until after lunch.
I really want to spend some time in the Art Gallery,
because they've got this wonderful painting by Rembrandt that I've always wanted to see.
What else should we see?
Well, the guidebook says the Botanical Gardens are worth spending some time in,
and they're open all day, from eight to six, so we can go there any time.
I'd like to go to the Markets near the river too, but...
oh... no, wait, that's only in the mornings, too.
As well as today and tomorrow, we can see some other places on Monday, you know.
But I don't think the Markets will be open then: they only open on Thursdays,
so we've missed them for this week.
Maybe we should go to the Cathedral today
because it's Sunday tomorrow, and even though it's open every day,
it might be more difficult to get in tomorrow because of the church services.
That's true,
but the Art Gallery isn't open on Sundays at all,
so we'll have to go there today.
The Castle's open every day except Mondays, so we're okay there,
and the Gardens of course only close at night.
Are all these places free or do we have to pay to go in?
What does the guidebook say?
I think there's a charge for all of them except the Botanical Gardens.
Oh, and the Markets, of course you don't pay to go in.
Okay.
Well, it looks like our plan is this:
we'll go to see the painting you like first, the Rembrandt,
then have lunch and go on to the Castle after that, and then the Cathedral.
Okay.
It says here that the roof of the Cathedral is really beautiful.
Is that right?
What I really want to do at the Cathedral is climb the tower.
The view is supposed to be spectacular.
Okay, well, that'll be more than enough for today.
Then, tomorrow, let's go to the Botanical Gardens and have a picnic.
I want to sit by the river and watch the swans.
This city's famous for them.

1235,Cam4 - Test 2 - Part 2,B2,cam4---test-2---part-2,58,"So the counselling services we offer deal with any problems arising from your studies,
or in your life outside the university.
Let's take academic counselling.
If you're confused about subjects or how to combine them in your degree,
then we can advise you and discuss the career you are aiming for,
so that you can see it all in context.
We can also chase up your tutor if you're not getting proper feedback on how you are getting on in your subject.
Besides help with academic problems,
you may also need personal counselling:
if you think you're already under stress,
well, just wait till classes begin next week.
You'll have to start adjusting to teaching and learning methods that may be unfamiliar to you,
as well as the mounting pressure as the deadline for that first assignment creeps up on you.
And of course, you have to cope with all this without your usual social network -
you know, the social contacts, family and friends you could normally rely on for help.
All of this causes anxiety.
Studying overseas can trigger a personal crisis -
you may have left a lot of what you might call 'unfinished business' back in your own country,
or you may have interrupted personal relationships
or even sometimes have broken them off to come overseas,
and so the student often feels lonely, unhappy, unmotivated
and unable to concentrate on studying.
Or there may be other things bothering you.
Our resident chaplain can offer you spiritual guidance if that's what you want,
or we can put you in touch with community groups that can provide you with social contacts and friendship.
What about exam stress?
It affects nearly everyone to some extent,
but especially overseas students like yourselves.
There may be a huge amount of family pressure on you to succeed,
and if you fail a subject or drop out of a course because it's too difficult
then your self-esteem can suffer.
But it's not the end of the world if you don't pass an exam -
I had to resit First Year Anthropology, so I can certainly offer you a sympathetic ear!
Anyway, exam failure can lead to worrying changes in the way you normally behave.
You may also be off your food,
or you may have dietary problems
because the local food is not to your liking and upsets you,
and this can affect your health and studies.
Glenda Roberts is our dietician in the Health Service
and we can put you on to her.
And we all have money problems, don't we?
But remember, full-time students can get a low-interest loan of up to six hundred dollars to buy books
and for similar study-related expenses.
That's right,
and you can get double that amount if you can't afford an item of equipment you need for your course -
a musical instrument, for example.
And it doesn't stop there.
When you move into a flat,
starting-up expenses, including furniture for it,
can be covered by a loan through the Welfare Service.
See Jill Freeman for details.
Can we help you?
Well, last academic year, in spite of staff cuts,
we counselled 240 international students for a total of 2600 hours counselling,
and, finally we won all but just 1 of the 12 appeals that we launched on behalf of students.
Not too bad for an understaffed service, don't you think?
That's all from me.
Thank you.

1236,Cam4 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam4---test-2---part-3,56,"Oh, there you are, good.
Sorry, I'm a bit late - there was a long queue.
So, have you worked out how to deal with this assignment then?
Not yet, we've only been here a couple of minutes ourselves.
Can you just remind me what the task is exactly?
Well, there are two, no, three, parts to it:
first, we've got to write an essay about ways of collecting data.
What's the title of the essay exactly?
I've got it here:
'Assess the two main methods of collecting data in social science research'.
And how much do we need to write?
1500 words.
That's for the essay.
Then, for the second part of the assignment, we have to choose one method of data collection,
and 'carry out a small-scale study',
'making appropriate use of the method chosen to gather data from at least five subjects'.
And then we have to write a report on the study?
That's right, of three to four thousand words.
Did you get as far as discussing which form of data collection we should go for -
questionnaire or interview, isn't it?
Yeah, I think we should use a questionnaire.
It'll be so much less time-consuming than organising interviews, I reckon.
Once we've agreed on the wording of it, we only have to send it out and wait for the responses.
Yes, I think it probably would be quicker.
But what did that article he gave us last week say about the quality of data from questionnaires?
I'm pretty sure it recommended questionnaires as a source of 'highly reliable data'.
As long as you design the questionnaire properly in the first place, the data will be fine.
No, I'm sure it talked about drawbacks as well, didn't it?
Something about the response rate and the problems you get if it's too low.
Yeah, but we only need data from five subjects anyway.
I suppose so.
Another drawback I remember it mentioned was that
questionnaire data tends not to reveal anything unexpected, because...
it is limited to the questions fixed in advance by the researcher.
Come on, Rosa. This is only a practice.
It's not meant to be real research, is it?
Well, not sure about that.
Maybe I'd better go through the article again, just to be sure.
Can you remember what it was called?
Sample Surveys in Social Science Research', I think.
By Mehta.
MEHTA?
Yeah.
And he also recommended a more recent book, called...
'Survey Research', by Bell, I think.
It's in that series published by London University.
And if we tried to use interviews instead,
I saw a book in the departmental library that'll be helpful: it's called 'Interviews That Work',
by Wilson, published in Oxford in 1988.
Right.
Oh, I've got a tutorial now.
Can we meet up again later this week?
What about Friday morning?
Suits me. 11 o'clock?
Fine.
Before Friday, I think we should all look through the reading list.

1237,Cam4 - Test 2 - Part 4,C2,cam4---test-2---part-4,84,"So far, in these lectures, we've been looking at crimes like robbery and murder -
both from a historical viewpoint and also in contemporary society -
and we've seen that the preoccupation in Western society with crime and with lawlessness
is part of a long and continuous tradition,
rather than something which is new and unique to modern society.
But over the past seventy years or so, there has been a massive increase in one type of crime,
which is what's known as 'corporate crime'.
Corporate crime is crime which, as the name suggests,
is connected with companies, with business organisations.
It includes illegal acts of either individuals or a group within the company,
but what is important is that these acts are normally in accordance with the goals of the company -
they're for the good of the company rather than the individual.
It's been defined as,
quote, 'crime which is committed for the corporate organisation' - the company - 'not against it', unquote.
So crimes like theft by employees -
things like embezzlement or fraud against one's actual employer are excluded according to this definition.
The employees may be involved
but they're acting in the first place for the company -
they may not even realise they're committing a crime
or they may realise but they feel it's excusable because it's policy,
or because otherwise they may lose their jobs.
So here, really, we're talking about the links between power and crime.
Now, this is one area that much less is generally known about than conventional or traditional crime.
It has been relatively ignored by the mass media -
for example, it tends to be under-reported in comparison with conventional crime in news broadcasts,
and in crime serials and films and so on -
they very rarely deal with corporate crime.
And it also tends to be ignored in academic circles -
there's been far more research on conventional crime and far more data is available.
There are several reasons for this lack of interest in corporate crime, compared with other types of crime.
It's often very complex,
whereas with conventional crime, it's usually possible to follow what's going on without specialist knowledge.
As well as this, whereas conventional crime usually has a lot of human interest,
corporate crime often has much less.
The third reason, and possibly the most significant one,
is that very often the victims are unaware -
they think their misfortune is an accident
or that it's the fault of no-one in particular.
They're unaware that they've been victims of a crime.
So, when we look at the effects of corporate crime,
we may find it's very difficult to assess the costs.
But these costs can be very considerable in both their economic and social aspects.
Let's look at the economic costs first.
For example, if a company is producing fruit juice
and it dilutes its product so that it's just a little below the concentration it should be,
many millions of people may be paying a small amount extra for their carton of orange juice.
Now small amounts like this may seem insignificant for individual customers -
too small to worry about -
but for the company, this deception might result in massive illegal profit.
However, all studies of corporate crime agree
that the individuals are in fact deprived of far more money by such crime
than they are by conventional crime like robbery and theft.
In addition to this, we have to consider the social costs of corporate crime
and these are again very difficult to assess, but they are considerable.
They're important because they can undermine the faith of the public in the business world
and also, more importantly,
because the main group of people they affect are, in fact, not the richer sections of society but the poorer.
So here companies are robbing the poor to benefit the rich.
There are two more points to do with corporate crime
that I'd like to illustrate with reference to a specific event
which occurred several years ago.
This was an explosion of a large oil tanker
which caused the loss of more than fifty lives of the crew.
It was an explosion which never should have happened
and a subsequent inquiry laid the blame not on anyone who had actually been on the tanker at the time,
but on the owners of the tanker.
They had deliberately decided not to carry out necessary repair work on the tanker as it was due to be sold,
and it was this lack of repair work which was directly responsible for the explosion.
Now this illustrates two points to do with corporate crime.
First of all, that it does not have to be intentional.
The owners of the tanker certainly did not intend it to explode.
But very serious consequences can result from people or organisations
not considering the possible results of their actions seriously enough.
The main crime here was indifference to the human results
rather than actual intention to harm anyone,
but that didn't make the results any less tragic.
And this leads me to my second point
that corporate crime can have very severe consequences.
It's not just a matter of companies making bigger profits than they should do,
but of events which may affect the lives of innocent people,
and yet very often, companies, because they say they didn't intend to harm anyone,
can avoid taking responsibility for the results of their actions.
And that has been a very dangerous loophole in the law.
A further example of corporate crime was...

Is that correct?
Yes, that's right.
I've been staying with my aunt and now my cousin is arriving from Singapore
and my aunt needs the room for him.
Oh, that's bad luck.
Well, I'll need to get some particulars first.
Sara, what's your full name?
Sara Lim,
and that's Sara without the 'h' at the end.
How old are you, Sara?
23, only just.
It was my birthday on the 21st of August.
Happy birthday for yesterday.
How long have you been in Australia?
A year in Adelaide and 6 months in Sydney.
I prefer Sydney, I've got more friends here.
What's your address at your aunt's house?
Flat one, 539 Forest Road, Canterbury.
And the post code is 2036.
Okay.
What are you studying now?
I was studying General English in Adelaide
and now I'm doing Academic English,
because I'm trying to get into Medicine next year.
That sounds good, but it'll take you a long time.
When would you like to move out from your aunt's?
My cousin arrives on Friday morning,
so I'd better be out on Thursday.
What, the 7th of September?
Yes, that's right.
That doesn't leave us much time.
Right, okay.
I need to know what kind of accommodation you'd like,
so I can get you something suitable.
Can I share a room with someone else?
I've been alone in my room at my aunt's
and I've always shared with my sister and I like that.
Yes, fine.
That'll save you money too.
Would you like to live with a family or do you think that a single person would be better for you?
I have lots of very nice single people on my books.
Do you have any women living alone, retired women?
Yes, I have quite a few whose children have grown up and left home.
In fact, I have some really lovely retired ladies,
living by themselves, who just love the company of students.
Most of them live in flats, but that's not a problem for you, is it?
Not at all. I'm used to that.
My aunt lives in a flat too, remember.
I'm not used to a big house with a garden, swimming pool, pets and all that.
Okay, fine.
I know quite a bit about what you want now.
I should let you know that your rent will be 160 dollars per week.
You'll have to pay me 320 dollars as a deposit before you move in.
The deposit is as insurance, in case you break something.
You'll need to pay monthly to me, by cash or cheque, I don't mind.
You don't need to pay for gas, electricity or water,
but you will need to pay your proportion of the phone bill.
Most families do that on an honour system,
but you'll have to wait and see.
Have you got any more questions for me?
When will you know where I can go?
I'll work on it now,
so come and see me tomorrow and I should have some news for you then.

1239,Cam4 - Test 3 - Part 2,B2,cam4---test-3---part-2,63,"Good evening,
and in this week's edition of 'Focus on the Arts',
Jane Hemmington is going to fill us in on what's in store for us at this year's Summer Festival.
Over to you, Jane.
Thank you, Geoffrey.
This year, the Summer Festival is the biggest we've ever seen,
so there should be something for everybody.
This is the third year they've run it and the timing's slightly different:
for the last couple of years it's been around the 5th to 17th,
but this year they wanted to allow everyone enough time to recover from the first of January celebrations
and they've put it at the end of the month.
The programme has sensational theatre, dance and also a large number of art exhibitions,
but the thing the Festival is most famous for is its great street music.
For today's report though, Geoffrey, I'm looking at some of the theatrical events that you might like to see;
in particular, at this year's theme - circuses.
I'm going to tell you about two circus performances,
but there are plenty of others in the programme.
I've chosen these because they represent distinct movements within circus performance.
The first is the Circus Romano from Italy.
As this is a travelling circus,
it follows a long tradition by performing in a marquee -
which is really like a canvas portable building,
usually put up in a green space or car park,
rather than in a theatre or stadium.
In spite of this, Circus Romano isn't at all like the traditional circuses I grew up with.
There are no animals - just very talented clowning and acrobatic routines.
The show has a lot of very funny moments, especially at the beginning,
but the best part is the music and lighting.
They're magical.
At forty-five dollars it's very expensive anyway -
it's really for adult tastes.
In fact, much of it would be wasted on children -
so I suggest you leave them at home.
The second circus performance is Circus Electrica at the Studio Theatre.
The purists are suggesting that this isn't a circus at all.
It's a showcase for skills in dance and magic,
rather than the usual ones you expect in a circus.
With only six performers it's a small production, which suits the venue well -
the Studio only seats about 200 people.
For my money, it's the aerial displays which are outstanding
as well as the magical tricks -
features which are missing from Circus Romano.
An interesting feature of the show is that the performers are so young -
the youngest is only 14.
But it's still well worth seeing: a good one for the whole family.
And finally, as it's summer,
you may wish to see some of the Festival performances that are being presented outdoors.
Like the famous Mekong Water Puppet Troupe,
performing in the City Gardens this week.
Now, water puppetry is amazing!
It's large puppets on long sticks,
controlled by puppeteers standing waist deep in the lake.
The puppets do comedy routines and there is some terrific formation dancing.
This is a fantastic show and the best moment comes at the end -
seeing the puppeteers.
When the troupe walks up out of the water, you get this amazing feeling.
It's really hard to believe that what you've been watching is lifeless wood and cloth.
As an adult, I had a great time,
but I did note that other older people in the audience weren't quite as taken with it as I was.
It's a must for young children though,
and that's the audience it's really aimed at.
Well, that's all I've time for today,
but I'll be back next week with more news of what's worth seeing and what it's best to miss.

1240,Cam4 - Test 3 - Part 3,B1,cam4---test-3---part-3,83,"Hello.
I'm Dawn Matthews.
Yes, hello.
I've been referred to you because I'm enquiring about the refresher courses that you run.
I'd like to find out a bit more about them.
Okay.
Well, we run quite a few different short courses for students who are either returning to study or studying part-time.
Um, tell me about your situation.
Well, I think that I really need some help in preparing for the coming semester,
especially to build up my confidence a bit
and help me study effectively because, you see,
I've been out in the work-force for nearly twelve years now, so...
it really is a long time since I was last a student.
Yes, it can seem like a long time, can't it?
Um, well, let me start by telling you what courses we have that might suit you.
Are you an undergraduate or a postgraduate?
Arts or Sciences?
Undergraduate, and I'm in the Business faculty.
Right then.
First of all, there's our intensive 'Study for Success' seminar
on the first and second of February.
It's aimed at students like you who are uncertain about what to expect at college,
and looks at a fairly wide range of approaches to university learning,
to motivate you to begin your study
and build on your own learning strategies.
Mm, that sounds good.
What are some of the strategies that are presented?
Well, we try to cover all aspects of study.
Some of the strategies in writing, for example,
would be improving your planning for writing,
organising your thinking
and building some techniques to help you write more clearly.
With reading, there'll be sessions aimed at getting into the habit of analysing material as you read it,
and tips to help you record and remember what you have read.
It really is very important to begin reading confidently right from the beginning.
There's also advice on how to get the most from your lectures
and practice in giving confident presentations,
as well as how to prepare for exams.
What about the motivational side of things?
Ah. Well, there's a range of motivational exercises that we do
to help the students feel positive and enthusiastic about their study.
The process of learning and exploring a subject can lead to a whole new way of looking at the world,
and the study skills and techniques that you build up
can be applied in all sorts of different ways.
Actually, I...
I'm very excited about the whole thing of taking up studying again but,
you know, I'm a little nervous about whether I'll manage to get everything done.
I suppose it's the same for all mature students?
Of course it is.
Two of the key components of the course are time management
and overcoming procrastination.
People discover that, once they learn to plan their days,
all the work can be accomplished and there'll still be time for leisure.
Is there an enrolment fee?
Well, er, oh, just a minute, let's see...
Ah, the cost is 30 pounds,
which includes all course materials and morning tea.
You have to arrange your own lunch.
That wouldn't be a problem.
I already make sandwiches for my three kids and my wife and myself every day.
I won't have to change my routine.
Now, I need to tell you that this is a very popular course
and it's essential that you book well ahead of time.
In fact, the Course Convenor tells me that there are only five places left.
What other course might be good for me?
There is one other that you could benefit from.
It's simply called 'Learning Skills for University Study'
and is on three consecutive mornings
starting on a Monday, from nine to twelve,
and costs 25 pounds.
This is aimed at upgrading the study skills most school-leavers have
and help them cope with the increased demands of university study.
It focuses mainly on making students more responsible for their own success.
What sort of things are covered in this course?
Well, basically it's more advanced thinking,
note-taking, reading and writing strategies,
but also some input about stress management.
I think I'd be better off starting from the basics and looking at all the strategies, don't you?
Yes, from what you've told me, I think that's more in line with your situation.
Alright then,
can I book a place on the 'Study for Success' seminar course now?
Yes.
Let me just get out a registration form and take down your details.

1241,Cam4 - Test 3 - Part 4,C1,cam4---test-3---part-4,51,"We're very grateful that the Committee has agreed that a representative for the Students' Union
can present students' suggestions about the design for the proposed new Union building.
We appreciate that some of our ideas may not be feasible in the circumstances,
but we do feel that it is important that the ultimate beneficiaries of the facilities should have some say in its design.
If I could start by briefly explaining what steps were taken to find out student opinion
and how we have arrived at conclusions.
Firstly, a meeting was held in the current Union for our SU Committee to explain the options.
Then we invited all students to submit written suggestions for the design,
placing cards in a suggestion box.
These suggestions then provided the basis for the design of a questionnaire,
which was completed by approximately 2000 of the College students
over a period of three weeks.
Finally, the SU Committee collated the results and drew up a report.
If I can just hand around a copy of that report.
This presentation is essentially a summary and discussion of the key points of this report.
So, in broad terms, the consensus was as follows.
Firstly, regarding the crucial matter of the site,
we presented the three options that you have proposed.
One: in the city centre, near the Faculty of Education;
two: on the outskirts of the city, near the park,
and three: out of town, near the halls of residence.
We asked students to cite reasons for and against these sites and,
and there was remarkable agreement on all three.
Site One was unpopular because of traffic and parking problems.
Site Two had a number of supporters,
mainly because it was close to most lecture rooms.
And Site Three, out of town, near the halls of residence,
was clearly the most popular because of access from living quarters.
It was clear that the Union was mainly to be used after lectures.
It was also felt that the larger site would allow more room for a choice of facilities.
Our second area of interest was obviously the facilities:
there was minimal interest in having a library on the premises,
but one option seemed to be a reading room instead - more useful.
We would like the current table games room to be replaced with a small gym.
And, if possible, a small swimming pool - not, of course, Olympic-sized!
There was a large number of respondents in favour of a travel agent's and insurance centre.
We also request that there be the offices of the Student Counselling Centre,
moving this from the Refectory.
There was, however, much disagreement about whether to build a drama theatre.
Just over forty per cent of the respondents were in favour,
but a largish minority were strongly against it,
claiming that it is elitist and a waste of funds.
Essentially the jury is out on that.
Finally, given the number of unfortunate incidents in the current Union over the past few months,
a strong point was repeatedly made about security.
The recommendations would be at least video surveillance
and security personnel who would check Student Union cards on request.
We doubt if it would be feasible to have a check at reception of all people coming in.
Well, this is the summary of the views of the student population.
As I say, fuller details are given in our report but
I'm happy to take any questions if...

1242,Cam4 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam4---test-4---part-1,10,"Hi Tony, thanks ever so much for coming.
You know we've been asked to organise something for John's farewell?
Yeah, sure, it's about time we started working out details.
Exactly.
We don't want to leave it so late that it's double the work.
Mmm, mm, right, do you want me to take notes?
That'd be great, thanks.
Right, first thing is,
when is the best time to hold it?
Well, he leaves on the 24th of December.
So what about the 22nd?
Yeah, I think that's about right.
We want it quite near the time, don't we?
Sure, and what about a venue?
In college? A hotel?
I think a hotel will probably work out rather expensive,
and I've been looking at the College Dining Room.
That seems pretty reasonable.
Fine, yeah, why not?
And then we ought to be thinking about invitations...
Who mustn't we forget to invite?
Well, obviously John and his wife.
Right.
And the Director.
The office staff.
And all the teachers and all the students.
Anyone else?
Faculty Heads?
No, better draw the line, I don't think it's necessary.
Yeah, you're right.
I don't mind writing the invitations.
When shall we get them out for?
Enough time but not too early.
What about the fifteenth of December?
Well, there are exams on the 16th - better avoid them.
10th?
Yeah, that should do it.
So what does that leave?
Oh yes, a present.
Would you mind doing that?
No, not at all;
we usually go round with an envelope during coffee break, don't we?
Yeah, coffee break's always the best time,
'cos people have got their money handy.
Yeah, exactly.
Do we suggest an amount?
Or does it seem a bit unfair?
No, I think people welcome it.
We suggested 6 dollars last time, is that okay?
Yeah, plenty, I would have thought,
which should leave us with about 90 dollars.
Have you any ideas for presents?
Well, I've been having a little think.
I thought...
you know, he loves music.
Yeah, and books.
So, I thought I'd check on prices for, well, perhaps CD players.
Yeah, that's a, that's a good idea,
and also I thought maybe, you know, a set of dictionaries.
I heard him say he needed a good one.
The other thing he was saying last week was that his computer printer had broken.
Umm. No, I'd be really frightened about getting the wrong type.
Okay, yeah.
The other thing is something for the home.
Jill suggested a coffee maker.
I'll certainly find out what they cost.
Okay, have you got all that down?
Yes.
Now we need to think a little more about the money.
I know we've got a set amount from the Social Fund.
Right, what does that cover?
It's meant to cover the cost of the room.
And a certain amount for food.
And also drinks?
Oh yeah, certainly.
But will it be enough?
What we've done in the past is to ask guests to bring some snacks.
Right.
We don't ask them to bring more drinks because we figure that's...
that should come from the Social Fund.
Okay.
Anything else for the guests to bring?
Well, oh, some music,
because there'll be a tape deck there in the room, and we can have some dancing later on.
Anything else?
It's just a thought, but a couple of years ago we had a really good party where we set up...
you know, some simple games.
Yeah, great.
Wasn't it based on photos from the students and teachers?
That's right.
So we should ask the guests to bring photos.
Okay. I'll put it on the invitations.
Now the last thing is,
who shall we ask to do the speech?
Don't you think it might be nice to have one of the students?
Well then, the Student Leader?
Yeah, much better than the Director giving speeches again.
Okay then, I'll ask her.
Lovely!
So, is that all?
Looks like it.
Great! Thanks ever so much...

1244,Cam4 - Test 4 - Part 3,B1,cam4---test-4---part-3,11,"Hi Sue.
Hi Mike.
So what happened to you last week?
Oh, I was sick with the flu.
What's this I hear about a big assignment we've got to do?
Oh, well, basically, we've got to find two science experiments
to do with a group of 8-year-old children at the local primary school,
and we've got to complete it by the end of the week.
That sounds like hard work.
Where are we supposed to get the ideas for these experiments from?
Well, I managed to get hold of two books from the library.
Oh, well done!
How about if we take a look at the experiments in this book first
and see if anything looks suitable?
I can make notes as we go, about equipment and the purpose of the experiments.
Okay, let's see...
the first experiment is called 'Make your own hovercraft',
which sounds very ambitious!
Mind you, you only need 20 balloons and a table -
you don't need any special engines or anything like that!
What do you do with it all?
Er, you blow up the balloons and you balance the table on them,
upside down of course, and the kids get to ride around on it.
You know, the other kids sort of push them around the room.
The main purpose is to show how hovercrafts work,
and how things hover around on just a cushion of air.
Okay, that doesn't sound too bad.
Okay, ready for number two?
Now this one is called 'Unusual Measures of Lengths',
and you basically use lots of paperclips.
The kids go around the class measuring things -
you know, how long the desk is, and that sort of thing,
and then they all compare their answers.
And, basically, because not all paperclips are the same lengths,
they should come up with some strange answers.
It's supposed to demonstrate the importance of having fixed units of measurement.
Yeah, that's not bad.
Okay, now for number three you need rock salt or copper sulphate.
Oh, I'm not sure about that!
Well, just put down the rock salt then...
apart from that you only need a jar of water.
And basically you dissolve lots of salt into the water
and watch the crystals form,
so it basically teaches the kids about growing crystals.
Yeah, I suppose it would be nice to grow something.
Hmm, let's move on and have a look at number four.
Okay, this one is called 'Spinning colour wheel'.
It looks like you get some cardboard and draw a circle on it,
divide it into six equal segments and colour each one in using different colours,
then you thread a piece of string through the middle.
So we'd need some string as well.
Yes, sorry...
and you spin the wheel around
and if you can get it spinning fast enough,
hopefully the colours all merge and show up as white.
Oh, I didn't know that.
What's the principle behind it?
Well it's pretty elementary physics, really.
It teaches them about how white light or ordinary light is made up.
Hmm, well that doesn't sound too bad.
Now there's only one more left in this book isn't there?
What does that one say?
Um, well it's another one where they'd get to make something.
Sounds very interesting.
You need quite a lot of equipment actually -
a hand drill, an old record,
a pin or needle, some paper and a bolt.
Hmm, go on, what do they have to do?
Well, they basically make a record player.
The main idea is to teach them about recording sound,
but hopefully they'd also see that you need motion and an amplifier to make the sound heard.
Okay, well it does sound interesting.
Shall we go through all of those again and decide if any of them are going to be suitable?
Right, number one.
I thought this one sounded nice: there'd be lots of activity
and it doesn't need too much in the way of equipment.
Yes, that's true, but...
don't you think it's a bit risky to get a group of 8-year-olds pushing each other around a classroom like that?
Someone could get hurt.
No, I don't like the sound of that one at all!
Maybe you're right.
What about number two, with the paperclips?
It sounds tame enough.
Yes, a bit too tame if you ask me.
I think it needs to be something a bit more active and interesting than that, don't you?
Yes, I suppose you're right.
We won't get a very good mark if the children don't actually enjoy the experiments,
and I suppose we could turn them off science for good!
Well, what about the next one, number three?
Now, I quite like the idea of this one.
Yes, so do I,
but I seem to remember when we did it at high school
we had to wait up to a fortnight before we saw any halfway decent results.
Oh, yes well, that won't be any good then.
We'll only see the kids for one or two hours at the most.
Yes, and we have to do the experiments and write up our results within a week,
so that one won't do at all.
Okay, well, what did you think of number four?
I like the idea of it, but
do you think it will be a bit elementary for them?
Well, they are only eight you know!
I know, but you know what I mean.
Don't you think the activity itself is a bit babyish?
Hmm, maybe you're right.
They might have fun but, I mean, cutting out a circle and colouring it in?
Okay, well, what about number five?
I thought this one sounded a bit too good to be true - great equipment!
Yeah.
But don't you think it's a bit ambitious for this age group?
I mean, I don't want to start off something and then have to abandon it if they just can't cope with it.
I could see us ending up doing just about all of the work for them.
I guess you're right.
Oh well, maybe we could store that idea away for later.
Yep, let's hope this second book has something better!

1245,Cam4 - Test 4 - Part 4,B2,cam4---test-4---part-4,63,"Today we're going to look at one of my favourite fish -
the shark.
As you know, sharks have a reputation for being very dangerous creatures
capable of injuring or killing humans,
and I'd like to talk about sharks in Australia.
Sharks are rather large fish,
often growing to over 10 metres
and the longest sharks caught in Australia have reached sixteen metres.
Sharks vary in weight with size and breed, of course,
but the heaviest shark caught in Australia was a White Pointer -
that weighed 795 kilograms -
quite a size!
Sharks have a different structure to most fish:
instead of a skeleton made of bone,
they have a tough elastic skeleton of cartilage.
Unlike bone, this firm, pliable material is rather like your nose,
and allows the shark to bend easily as it swims.
The shark's skin isn't covered with scales, like other fish,
instead, the skin's covered with barbs, giving it a rough texture like sandpaper.
As you know, sharks are very quick swimmers.
This is made possible by their fins,
one set at the side and another set underneath the body,
and the tail also helps the shark move forward quickly.
Unlike other fish,
sharks have to keep swimming if they want to stay at a particular depth,
and they rarely swim at the surface.
Mostly, they swim at the bottom of the ocean,
scavenging and picking up food that's lying on the ocean floor.
While most other animals, including fish, hunt their prey by means of their eyesight,
sharks hunt essentially by smell.
They have a very acute sense of smell -
and can sense the presence of food long before they can see it.
In Australia, where people spend a lot of time at the beach,
the government has realised that it must prevent sharks from swimming near its beaches.
As a result, they've introduced a beach-netting program.
Beach-netting, or meshing, involves setting large nets parallel to the shore;
this means that the nets on New South Wales beaches are set on one day,
and then lifted and taken out to sea on the next day.
When shark-netting first began in 1939,
only the Sydney metropolitan beaches were meshed -
these beaches were chosen because beaches near the city are usually the most crowded with swimmers.
Ten years later, in 1949,
systematic meshing was extended to include the beaches to the south of Sydney.
As a result of the general success of the program in Sydney,
shark-meshing was introduced to the state of Queensland around 1970.
The New Zealand authorities also looked at it,
but considered meshing uneconomical - as did Tahiti in the Pacific.
At around the same time, South Africa introduced meshing to some of its most popular swimming beaches.
When meshing began, approximately 1500 sharks were caught in the first year.
However, this declined in the years that followed,
and since that time, the average annual catch has been only about 150 a year.
The majority of sharks are caught during the warmest months, from November to February,
when sharks are most active
and when both the air and the ocean are at their maximum temperature.
Despite quite large catches,
some people believe that shark meshing is not the best way to catch sharks.
It's not that they think sharks are afraid of nets, or because they eat holes in them,
because neither of these is true.
But meshing does appear to be less effective than some other methods,
especially when there are big seas with high rolling waves and strong currents
and anything that lets the sand move -
the sand that's holding the nets down.
When this moves the nets will also become less effective.

Oh, what does it depend on?
Well, obviously the quality of the area.
And then whether there's a garden.
Well, as I said, we'd want a garden.
And a garage pushes up the price.
Right...
well, we wouldn't necessarily need one.

1247,Cam3 - Test 1 - Part 2,B1,cam3---test-1---part-2,10,"Hello, Mrs Sutton. Come in.
How are you settling in next door?
Have all your things from Canada arrived yet?
I thought I saw a removals van outside your house yesterday afternoon.
Yes. They came yesterday.
We spent all day yesterday arranging them.
It's beginning to feel a bit more like home now.
Oh that's good.
Look, come in and sit down.
Are you alright?
You look a bit worried.
Well, I am a bit.
I'm sorry to bother you so early, Mrs Smith, but
I wonder if you could help me.
Could you tell me how I can get hold of a doctor?
Our daughter, Anna, isn't very well this morning and...
I may have to call somebody out.
She keeps being sick and I am beginning to get a bit worried.
I just don't know how the health system works here in England.
All I know is that it's very different from ours back in Canada.
Well, I don't know really where to start.
Let me think.
Well, the first thing you have to do is find a family doctor -
sometimes we call them general practitioners as well -
and register with him or her.
If you live here, you've got to be on a doctor's list.
If you're not, things can be a bit difficult.
Nobody will come out to you if you're not registered.
Anyway, they work in things called practices.
Sort of small groups of family doctors all working together in the same building.
Now what you've got to do this morning is register with one of them.
There are two practices near here,
so we're quite well off for doctors in this part of Manchester.
There's the Dean End Health Centre about ten minutes' walk away
and there's another practice in South Hay.
That's about five minutes away going towards the town centre.
We're registered at the Dean End one,
but they're both okay.
There are about six doctors in our practice and four in the other.
So ours is quite big in comparison.
And the building and everything's a bit more modern.
South Hay is a bit old-fashioned but the doctors are okay.
Their only problem is that they don't have a proper appointment system.
Sometimes you have to wait for ages there to see someone.
Anyway, you go to the receptionist in whichever health centre
and ask her to register you with a doctor there.
You have to fill in a form, but it doesn't take long.
Ours is called Dr Jones
and we've been going to him for years -
ever since we moved here fifteen years ago.
I wouldn't say he's brilliant but I suppose he's alright really.
We're used to him now.
They say he's very good with elderly people,
but he does tend to get a bit impatient with children.
Listen, the one who's supposed to be really good with small children is Dr Shaw.
I've heard lots of people say that.
She's young and she's got small children of her own.
So you could try registering with her.
And if her list's full,
I heard somebody say the other day that there's a really nice young doctor at South Hay,
a Dr Williams.
He holds special clinics for people with back trouble.
But that's not really your problem, is it?
If you want a doctor to visit you at home,
you have to ask for a home visit.
You're supposed to do that before 10.30 in the morning,
but obviously, if it's an emergency, you can phone at any time, night or day.
It might not be your doctor that comes, though.
It's quite often one of the other doctors in the practice.
It doesn't really seem to make much difference.
Otherwise you make an appointment to see your doctor at the health centre.
You usually get seen the same day.
Not always of course, but usually, as I say.
They hold surgeries between 9 and 11.30 every weekday,
and from 4 to 6.30 Monday to Thursday.
Saturdays are only for emergencies.
When the doctor sees you, he gives you a prescription.
He writes what medication you need on it and you take it to a chemist's shop.
There's one opposite the centre.
If it's for a child under 16, you don't have to pay.
So if it's for Anna, there's no problem.
The same thing goes if you're unemployed or retired, or if you're pregnant.
Just as well because it's not cheap.
You pay the same price for each item the doctor has prescribed.
At the moment it's something like ¬£5 per item.
So you pay for the medication but the consultation with the doctor doesn't cost you anything.
It's completely free as long as you're a resident here.
You're going to be here for three years, aren't you?
So there shouldn't be any question of you paying anything to see the doctor.
So that's one less problem to worry about.
Look, Mrs Sutton. If you want,
I'll sit with your daughter for half an hour if you want to go down to the health centre to register.
It's no trouble really, don't worry.
Are you sure you wouldn't mind?
That would really help me a lot.
I'll ask them if they can send someone round later to see Anna.
I think I'll try the Dean End Centre.
Good idea.
Don't worry about Anna.
Right. I'll be back as soon as I can.

Yes, that's right.
Do come in and sit down.
Thanks.
Right.
Well, Jonathan, as we explained in your letter,
in this part of the interview, we like to talk through your application form...
your experience to date, etc....
and then in the second part,
you go for a group interview.
Group interview... yes, I understand...
So... your first degree was in Economics?
Yes, but I also did Politics as a major strand.
And you graduated in 1989.
And I see you have been doing some teaching...
Yes. I worked as a volunteer teacher in West Africa.
I was there for almost three years in total from....
1990 to... 1992.
How interesting.
What organisation was that with?
It's not one of the major ones. It's called Teach South.
Oh, right.
Yes, I have heard of it.
It operates in several African countries, doesn't it?
And what kind of school was it?
A rural co-operative.
Oh, a rural co-operative, how interesting...
and what did you teach?
A variety of things in different years...
I did... with Forms 1 to 3 mainly Geography
and some English with Form 5.
Then in my final year,
I took on some Agricultural Science with the top year...
that's Form 6.
Right. Quite a variety then...
I also ran the school farm.
How interesting...
And how did you find the whole experience?
I'll be honest with you.
At the end of the first year I really wanted to leave and come home.
Oh, why was that?
Well... I was very homesick at first and missed my family...
Yes, I can understand that.
and I also found it frustrating to have so few teaching resources,
but I did decide to stay
and in the end I extended my tour to a third year.
Right.
Things must have looked up then?
Yes. We set up a very successful project breeding cattle to sell locally.
Really?
And then after a lot of hard work we finally got funds for new farm buildings.
And you wanted to see things through?
And that's why you want to train to teach Geography?
Yes.
I've had a couple of jobs since then
but I now realise I like teaching best.
And I chose Geography because...
because it is my favourite subject...
and also because I think it has so many useful applications.
Well... you certainly have had some interesting work experience.
I'll ask you now to go on to the next stage...

1249,Cam3 - Test 1 - Part 4,B2,cam3---test-1---part-4,77,"Today's Health Counsel is presented by Paula Clayburg,
who is the chief Counsellor at Liverpool's famous pain clinic:
The Wilton Clinic.
Paula...
Do you know what Prince Charles, Seve Ballesteros and Elizabeth Taylor have in common?
They all suffer from chronic back pain.
In fact, bad backs are one of the most common health problems today,
affecting people in all walks of life.
The most recent available figures show that about a quarter of a million people
are incapacitated with back pain every day.
And many sufferers don't know the cause or the solution to their problem.
The majority of our patients at the clinic tend to be women.
They are especially vulnerable because of pregnancy
but also because of osteoporosis,
which I personally believe to be the major cause of problems for women.
I have many women patients who say they have completely given up exercise
because the pain makes them so miserable.
But of course that starts up a vicious circle.
Bed rest, giving up exercise and pain killers are traditional responses to back pain
but, although there are many excellent drugs on the market,
at our clinic we are beginning to realise the unique benefits of relaxation therapy.
Other specialists in the field make a strong case for certain types of exercise,
but in our experience they are easily mishandled
and can lead to more harm than good.
Now, let's look at some of the reasons why back pain is developing into such a unique menace.
In general, the body is pretty good at self-repair.
A strain or a blow to a limb, though painful at the time, generally resolves itself.
But the body's response to back injury can be very counter-productive.
When pain strikes,
we attempt to keep the back as immobile as possible,
which makes the muscles tense up.
Research shows that they often go into spasm,
which causes further twisting of the spine.
A vicious circle is underway.
The second mistake we often make when stricken with extreme back pain
is to go to bed and stay there.
Although at the clinic, we recognise that a short rest in bed can be helpful...
up to two days...
any longer makes our back muscles become weaker and unable to hold up our spine.
The pain therefore becomes worse.
Another problem is being overweight.
Anyone a stone or more over-weight
who already has back pain is not doing himself any favours:
though it won't actually set it off in the first place,
the weight will increase the strain and make things worse.
The British diet could be partially to blame for the increase in back pain:
over the last ten years the average weight of men has risen by 11 lbs
and of women by 9 lbs.
So much for the causes and aggravations of pain.
But what can we do to help?
There are many ways in which simple day-to-day care can make all the difference.
The first point to watch of course is weight.
If you are overweight, a diet will make all the difference.
Also, studies have shown that just one hour sitting in a slouched position
can strain ligaments in the back which can take months to heal.
At the clinic, we have come to the conclusion
that the major cause of the problem is not with the design of chairs, as some have suggested,
but in the way we sit in them.
It can be useful to get special orthopaedic chairs,
but remember the most important improvement should be in our posture.
Another enemy of your back is, of course, your beds.
If your bed doesn't give enough support,
back muscles and ligaments work all night trying to correct spinal alignment,
so you wake up with a tired aching back.
Try out an orthopaedic mattress or a spring slatted bed.
Research shows that both can be beneficial for certain types of back pain.
Another hazard for your back are the shock waves which travel up your spine when you walk,
known as heel strike.
A real find for our patients has been the shock-absorbing shoe insert.
A cheap but very effective solution.
And you might be better off avoiding shoes with heels higher than one and a half inches.
Though absolutely flat shoes can be a solution for some,
others find their posture suffers.
Finally, a word about the state-of-the-art relief - the TENS machine -
a small battery-powered gadget
which delivers subliminal electrical pulses to the skin.
Our experience indicates that your money is better spent on the more old-fashioned remedies.

Well, firstly, let me give you this booklet.
It tells you a bit more about the school,
the courses and the social activities we offer.
Now, on the first page,
there's an outline of this morning's activities.
There, you see?
The programme starts at 10 o'clock.
Try not to be late as it's a very full day.
At 10 o'clock, all the new students will gather in the Main Hall
to meet the Principal and the rest of the staff.
In fact, you spend most of the morning in the Main Hall.
Where's that?
I'll show you in a minute.
Just let me quickly run through this morning's events first
and then I'll explain how to get there.
Yes, okay.
Right. Where were we?
Yes, so, the Principal's talk will last about 15 minutes
and then the Director of Studies will talk to you for half an hour about the courses
and the different requirements for each.
After that, the Student Adviser will tell you about the various services and activities we offer to students.
Any questions?
So, all of this is in the Main Hall?
That's right.
And then you'll go next door to Classroom 5 at 11 o'clock.
What happens there?
You'll have a test.
Test?
I don't like the sound of that.
What sort of test?
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.
It's just a placement test to help us find your level of English
so that we can put you in the right class.
It won't last long.
But how do I find the Main Hall?
Right; if you look on the back of the booklet I gave you,
you'll see a map of the school.
Let me show you.
Look; you came in through the Main Entrance, here,
and now we're here at Reception.
Now, to get to the Main Hall,
you walk on to the end of this corridor in front of you
and then you turn left.
Walk along past the Language Laboratory
and then past the Library,
which is next to the Language Lab, on the same side,
and facing you is the Main Hall, at the end of the corridor.
You can't miss it.
So it's next to the Library, in fact.
Yes, that's right.
I should be able to find that.
And do you have a Computer Laboratory?
Yes, we do.
Could you tell me where that is?
Certainly, yes.
You go down to the end of this corridor again
but, this time, don't turn left;
turn right, away from the Main Hall.
The Computer Lab. is immediately on your right. Okay?
And where's the staff room, in case I need to find a teacher at some stage?
The staff room is near the main entrance,
on the left over there, just opposite the Reception desk.
In a day or two, I'm sure you'll find your way around very easily.
Oh, one last thing.
Is there a student common room?
Oh yes, I forgot to mention that.
It's this area here,
very close to where we are now,
to the right of the Reception desk as you come in the main entrance.
There's tea and coffee facilities there.
Great.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

1251,Cam3 - Test 2 - Part 2,B1,cam3---test-2---part-2,47,"Hello everybody and welcome to this informal meeting about the University [Helpline].
The Helpline was set up ten years ago by the Students Union
and it aims to provide new students to the university
with a service that they can use if they need information
about practical areas of student life that they are unfamiliar with.
Let me give you some examples of the type of help we can offer.
We can provide information on financial matters;
for example, you may feel that your grant is insufficient to see you through college life
or you may have some queries regarding the fees you are paying
if you are an overseas student.
In both cases, the Helpline would be able to go through things with you
and see what the outcome might be.
Another area we can help with is what we generally term the 'domestic' area;
things such as childcare and the availability of nursery provision, for example, come under this.
Then there's 'academic' issues that may arise while you are in the early stages of your course
that you may not know what to do about.
You may wish to know more about essay deadlines, for example,
or how to use the library -
there are all kinds of questions you will find yourself asking
and not knowing where to get quick answers from.
The Helpline would be able to provide these.
The last example I've given here is simply termed 'social' -
and yes, there is a lot of social life here!
But you may have a particular interest you wish to pursue
or you may wish to participate in outings or trips
if you don't know many people at the moment.
Let me give you some details
so that you know where to go and who to see if you want to pay us a visit.
Generally you will see our Helpline officer Jackie Kouachi,
that's KOUACHI.
Jackie is a full-time employee of the Student Union
and she works in the Student Welfare Office -
that's the office that deals with all matters related to student welfare
and it's located at 13 Marshall Road.
I have some maps here for those of you who haven't been there yet.
If you wish to ring the office,
the number is 3269940.
That's 3269940.
The office is open between 9.30 and 6 o'clock on weekdays
and from 10 to 4 on Saturdays
and there'll be somebody there usually Jackie or myself - between those times.
If you want to make an appointment, you can phone or call at the office in person.
Please note that it may not be possible for anyone to see you straight away -
particularly if it is a busy time - lunch time for example -
and you may have to go on the waiting list and then come back later.
Well, enough from me.
Any questions?

1252,Cam3 - Test 2 - Part 3,B2,cam3---test-2---part-3,69,"Good morning.
So, we've looked at various aspects of staff selection this term and...
I think by now you should be beginning to see
how much more there is to it than just putting applicants through a short interview
or asking the 'right' questions.
So I think you should be ready for today's tutorial on 'matching the person to the job'.
We're going to talk today about the importance of choosing that all round 'right' person.
Right. So we have to put ourselves into the role of the manager or supervisor?
Yes.
And then we're going to imagine how different applicants would fit into the team or group they have to work with...
we'll look at some examples later.
It's just theoretical at the moment...
Yes.
The point is, you can select someone - even a friend -
who has all the right qualifications, degrees, certificates, whatever.
You can also check that they have a lot of experience...
that they've done the sort of tasks that you want them to do in your office already,
in a similar environment.
But if they start work
and you realise that they just don't get along with everybody else, that...
say, they've got sharply contrasting views on how something will work...
well, with the best will in the world, you may be backing a loser.
Wouldn't it be just a question of company training, though?
Not always.
Particularly in a team situation,
and I think it's important to think in terms of that type of working environment.
People have to have faith in each other's ability to carry out the task their boss has set them.
They have to trust that everyone will do their part of the job,
and you can't necessarily train people for this.
But it's like trying to find out what someone's personality is like in a job interview...
I mean... you just can't do that.
Even if you try, you won't find out what they're really like until they actually start work.
Well, in most interviews you usually ask candidates questions about their hobbies and...
what they like doing in their spare time...
that sort of thing...
so, employers are already involved in the practice of...
well, doing part of the task.
But it doesn't tell you anything.
It doesn't tell you if they're easy-going or hate smokers or whatever.
Well, arguably it does give you a bit of information about an applicant's character,
but also more and more employers around the world are making use of what are called 'personality questionnaires'
to help them select new staff and...
What's it called?
A Personality Questionnaire.
They have to be filled out by the candidates some time during the selection procedure,
often just before an interview.
The idea is actually quite old.
Apparently they were used by the ancient Chinese for picking out clerks and civil servants,
and then later they were used by the military to put people in appropriate areas of work.
They've gained a lot of ground since then
and there are about 80,000 different tests available now
and almost two thirds of the large employers use them.
Which makes you think that there must be something in them.
That's right.
They ask the sort of questions that you might expect,
like do you like working under pressure or...
are you good at keeping deadlines.
And what if people can see through them and just write what they think the employer wants to see?
Well that's always a possibility.
I mean, it's human nature to lie, isn't it?
Well, that's the point.
Apparently it isn't.
These tests are compiled by experts
and they believe that the answers can provide a few simple indicators
as to roughly the type of person that you are...
that people will generally be truthful in that situation.
And then you can go some way towards finding out whether someone's, say, forward-looking...
a go-ahead type of person... or resistant to change.
And there are all kinds of...

Okay.
As you know, today Vivien is going to do a presentation on the hat-making project
she did with her class during her last teaching practice. So...
Over to you, Vivien.
Thanks.
Mr Yardley has asked me to describe to you
the project I did as a student teacher at a secondary school in London.
I was at this school for six weeks
and I taught a variety of subjects to a class of 14 year old pupils.
The project I chose to do was a hat-making project
and I think this project could easily be adapted to suit any age.
So, to explain the project...
After we'd done the research,
we went back to the classroom to make two basic hat shapes using rolls of old wallpaper.
We each made, first of all, a conical hat by...
well, if I show you now...
cutting out a circle and then making one cut up to the centre
and then... er... overlapping the cut like this...
a conical hat that sits on your head.
The other hat we made was a little more complicated.
First of all, we cut out a circle again...
like this...
then you need a long piece with flaps on it.
I've already made that bit which I have here.
you bend the flaps over and stick them with glue or prittstick
to the underside of the circle... like this.
Again, I've prepared this so that I don't get glue everywhere.
The pupils do, of course, so you need plenty of covers for the table.
And there you have a pillbox hat as in pill and box.
Now variations and combinations of these two hat shapes formed the basis of the pupils' final designs.
The next stage of the project was the design phase
and this involved, first of all, using their pages of research to draw a design of their hat on paper.
That's the easy part.
They then had to translate their two-dimensional design into a form to fit their head.
I encouraged them to make a small-scale, three dimensional hat first
so that they could experiment with how to achieve the form they required
and I imposed certain constraints on them to keep things simple.
For example, they had to use paper not card.
Paper is more pliable and easier to handle.
They also had to limit their colours to white, grey or brown shades of paper
which reflected the colours of the buildings they were using as a model for their hats
and they had to make sure their glue didn't show!
Well, it was very enjoyable
and just to give you an idea of what they produced,
I've brought along three hats to show you.
This one here is based on a circular stairway in an old building in London.
It uses three pillbox hats, one on top of the other.
This was designed by Theresa.
Here's another one that has a simple strip going round the base of the hat
but has then gone on to add strips of paper that come out from the base
and that meet at the top of the hat - rather like a crown -
making a fairly tall hat.
This was made by Muriel.
And lastly, there's a combination of the pillbox or single strip around the base
and then the conical hat shape on top to form a castle turret.
This was made by Fabrice,
and there are many more that I could have brought.
Thank you, Vivien.
That was most interesting.
Now what we can learn from this...

so we don't have it hanging over us. Okay?
Good idea. I'll take notes.
First thing... numbers...
have we got anything definite?
Well... I've been working it out and I think 40 to 43.
Shall we put 45 to be on the safe side?
Yep, fine.
Dates... well, that's straightforward.
The last working day before Christmas... which is...
which is December the 21st.
which is going to be pretty difficult to book at Christmas
so we'd better think of two or three places just to be on the safe side.
Well, last year's was hopeless.
The Red Lion, wasn't it?
Yep.
We ought to go for something more expensive, cos you...
...you gets what you pay for.
That new Indian restaurant in Wetherfield is supposed to be excellent...
the Rajdoot.
How do you spell that?
RAJDOOT.
But it's bound to be packed.
Well, let's put that down as the first choice and have some back-ups.
What about the Park View Hotel as a second choice?
Yes, that's always reliable.
Park View Hotel...
And the London Arms in case.
London Arms...
I'll call them now if you want.
No. I'll do it, Joan.
You're really busy.
Oh, have you got the numbers?
Not for the Rajdoot, but...
right... Park View Hotel:
777192.
And London Arms: 208657.
Great.
Before I ring, we'd better just make sure they're within the price range.
Up to ¬£15 a head?
I think you'll find some people won't be able to go that high.
Well, you can't get anything decent under ¬£10.
Okay.
We'll say ¬£12?
Okay.
And we'd better make sure there's good vegetarian food.
And a non-smoking section!
You know what the boss is like.
Don't remind me.
I'll let you know as soon as I get anything.
Good news. I found Rajdoot's number straight away
and they can fit us in.
Their Christmas menu sounds great.
What is it?
French onion soup or fruit juice.
Roast dinner or lentil curry...
sounds ordinary but my friend said it was really tasty.
Umm... lentil curry... that's unusual.
And then for dessert, there's traditional plum pudding
or apple pie, plus coffee.
That sounds really good for ¬£12.
Did you book it?
Well, I said I'd check with the staff first.
But they did say they'd hold the booking until next Wednesday anyway.
Oh, and if we go ahead, they'd like a ¬£50 deposit.
50 is normal... that's fine.
And they want a letter.
Right... to confirm.
They say with such large numbers we have to choose the menu in advance.
That won't be a problem.
I'll put up a notice with details of the restaurant and the menu.
When did you say they wanted confirmation by?
It was... let's see...
the 4th of November.
Where do you think I should put up the notice?
Where everyone's guaranteed to see it.
On the caf√© noticeboard I should think.
Hardly anyone looks at that.
Well, the Newsletter is probably your best bet.
Good idea.
I'll go and do that now.

1255,Cam3 - Test 3 - Part 2,B1,cam3---test-3---part-2,52,"Welcome to the Sports Centre.
It's good to see that there are so many people wanting to find out about our sports facilities.
First of all, membership.
All students at the college are entitled to become members of the Sports Centre,
for an annual fee of ¬£9.50.
To register with us and get your membership card,
you need to come to reception, between 2 and 6 pm,
Monday to Thursday.
I'm afraid we can't register new members on Friday,
so it's Monday to Thursday, 2 to 6, at reception.
Now, there are three things that you must remember to bring with you when you come to register;
they are: your Union card,
a recent passport-sized photograph of yourself, and the fee.
It doesn't matter whether you bring cash or a cheque.
We can't issue your card unless you bring all three; so, don't forget:
your Union card, passport photo and fee.
Then once you have got your sports card,
you will need to bring it with you whenever you come to book or use any Sports Centre facilities.
Booking over the phone is not allowed,
so you have to come here in person, with your card, when you want to book.
Our opening hours seem to get longer every year.
We are now open from 9am to 10pm on weekdays
and from 10am to 6pm on Saturdays.
For those of you who are up and about early in the morning,
we are introducing a 50% 'morning discount' this year.
This is because the facilities tended to be under-used in the mornings last year.
It means that all the sessions will be half-price between 9 am and 12 noon on weekdays.
So, what exactly are the facilities?
What sports can you play here?
Well, this room we are in at the moment is called the Main Hall,
and it's used mainly for team sports such as football, volleyball and basketball,
but also for badminton and aerobics.
On the other side of the reception area there is the dance studio;
this provides a smaller, more intimate space,
which we use for ballet, modern dance and martial arts -
not at the same time, of course.
Then, in a separate building, which you may have noticed on your way here...
it's on the other side of the car park...
there are the squash courts, six of them,
and at the far end of the building a fitness room.
This is our newest facility, only completed in the Spring,
but it is already proving to be one of the most popular.
As well as all these facilities available here on the campus,
we also have an arrangement with the local tennis club,
which is only two miles away,
entitling our students to use their courts on weekday mornings in the Summer.
So, I think that there should be something here for everybody,
and I hope to see all of you at the Centre, making use of the facilities.
If, in the course of the year,
you have any suggestions as to how the service we provide might be improved
or its appeal widened,
I'll be interested to hear from you.

Well, Anne helped me with some of the electronics work.
Then you must put her name in as well.
Right...
Ann Ray.
Sorry. It's ANNE
and her surname is spelt REA.
Good start! Okay...
REA.
And age is easy. You're both 16.
What have you called the design? Keep it short.
What about jigsaw puzzle design for visually handicapped?
Too long.
Just say blind puzzle, that'll do.
Okay.
Right, now, size of equipment?
I've got it noted down here...
um, yes, length, sorry, width is 20 centimetres.
Okay.
Length is 50 centimetres,
and then the depth is... well, it's very little.
What would you say? I think you can be approximate.
I'd say 2.5 centimetres.
And the electricity supply?
Is it mains operated?
No it isn't, it's actually battery.
Okay, write battery.
Fine.
Okay. It's the next bit that I'm really not sure what to put.
Well, special features means...
what is really new about this, you know, suitable for the group you made it for.
Well, it's safe for children.
That's fine. Put that in.
Okay, and of course we think it's educational.
There you are, you've done it.
Anything else?
Well, I think the price is good.
That's probably the most important factor.
Okay... cheap price.
Which brings us on to the next bit.
What's the cost?
Well, the pieces we made out of old wood...
they cost, ooh, $5.
And the electrics?
They were more expensive... say, $9.50.
Brilliant.
Now what do they mean by other comments?
It's just a chance for you to say anything about the equipment, and problems you envisage.
Well, we would really like help with making plastic instead of wooden pieces.
Well, put something like, need help to make plastic pieces.
Okay.
And the other thing is, we'd like to develop a range of sizes.
That's fine, then, just put that.
And the last bit is,
when will you send the equipment?
Well, we've got a lot of work on at the moment and...
we want to get it as good as we can.
Well, say 25th of June?
Can't we make it later?
Well, the last date is the 1st of July.
Why not say that?
Okay, that's what I'll put.
So, that's the lot!
That's brilliant.
Thanks very much, Mrs Collins.
I'll send it off straight away.
Glad to be of help.
Very best of luck to you both.
Thanks, bye.
Bye.

1257,Cam3 - Test 3 - Part 4,B2,cam3---test-3---part-4,75,"Today I'd like to introduce Ted Hunter,
who used to rear sheep and poultry
but who is here to tell us about a rather unusual type of livestock
that he's been concentrating on in the last few years.
Ted Hunter is a member of the Domesticated Ostrich Farming Association,
and is here to tell us about the possibilities of breeding and rearing these birds in this country.
Thank you, Paula.
When you look at international restaurant menus and supermarkets,
they all tend to feature the same range of meats -
beef, lamb, chicken, pork, that sort of thing.
But people are always interested in something different
and we're now finding that farming can bring new types of meat to our tables.
The kangaroo is one animal that's now being farmed for its meat
and eaten outside Australia, where it comes from.
It looks and tastes rather like rabbit,
though it's slightly darker in colour,
but it is rather tough, so that's a problem for some people.
Crocodiles are also being farmed for their meat.
This is rather like chicken,
pale and tender, and it's getting quite fashionable.
Some people also find it's rather fatty, but
I think it makes a really tasty sandwich.
Now a third type of meat becoming increasingly available,
and the one that I think is by far the nicest of the three, is ostrich,
which most people say has a similar taste and texture to beef.
However, it's much better for you than beef, as we'll see later.
Most people think of ostriches as wild animals,
but in fact ostriches have been farmed in South Africa since around 1860.
At first they were produced for their feathers.
In Africa they were used for tribal ceremonial dress
and they were also exported to Europe and America
where they were made into ladies' fans and used for decorating hats.
Later, feather fans and big, decorated hats went out of fashion
but ostriches were still bred,
this time for their hide.
This can be treated to produce about half a square metre of leather -
very delicate, fine stuff of very good quality.
At the same time, some of the meat was used for biltong -
the air-dried strips of meat popular in South Africa as a sort of fast food.
However, recently there's been more and more interest in the development of ostrich farming in other parts of the world,
and more people are recognising its value as a food source.
Ostrich meat is slightly higher in protein than beef -
and much lower in fats and cholesterol.
It tastes good too.
A series of European taste tests
found that 82% of people prefer ostrich to beef.
And one ostrich produces a lot of meat -
from around 30 to 50 kg mostly from the hindquarters of the bird.
Farmed ostriches don't need African climates,
and in fact ostrich farming is now becoming well established in other parts of the world.
However, setting up an ostrich farm isn't something to embark on lightly.
Mature breeding birds are very expensive -
even a fertilised ostrich egg isn't cheap
so you need quite a bit of capital to begin with.
Then the farmer needs special equipment such as incubators for the eggs.
The young chicks are very dependent on human minders,
and need a lot of attention from the people looking after them.
In addition, ostriches can't be intensively farmed -
they need space and exercise.
But in spite of this, they make good farming sense.
A cow produces only one calf a year
whereas a female ostrich can lay an egg every other day.
And because the farmers can use incubators and...
hatched chicks are nourished well and protected from danger,
the failure rate on farms is very low indeed
and almost all the fertilised eggs will hatch out into chicks
which will in turn reach maturity.
This is very different from the situation in the wild,
where the vast majority of chicks will die or be killed
before they grow up into mature ostriches.
So it's possible, once the initial outlay has been made,
for the farmer to be looking at very good profit margins indeed.
Ostrich farming is still in its early days outside Africa
but we hope that ostrich meat will be freely available soon
and before long will be as cheap as beef.

1258,Cam3 - Test 4 - Part 1,B1,cam3---test-4---part-1,74,"John, I've just had some good news.
Susan has had her baby.
Do you know when she had it?
Yesterday.
The 10th of August.
Oh, my father was born on August the 10th.
Give me the details and I'll make a note for everyone at work.
Okay.
Well, was it a boy or a girl?
It's a boy.
And what are they going to call him?
Tom.
Tom Lightfoot.
It sounds quite good, don't you think?
Yes, that has quite a good ring to it.
You know he's quite a big baby.
He weighed 4.25 kilos when he was born.
That does sound big, 4.25 kilos.
And he's long too, 46 centimetres.
Mmmm. Tall parents.
He'll grow up to be over 2 metres, I'd say.
With masses of black hair, curly black hair.
You know, we should go and visit them in hospital.
What about tomorrow afternoon at around 1 pm?
Yes, okay.
Where should we meet?...
Ah, I could come and pick you up at your house, if you like.
Yes, that would be wonderful.
My car is still off the road.
Just refresh my memory....
What's the address again?
It's 15 Chesterfield Road, Paddington.
It's next to the library, isn't it?
Not exactly. It's next to a bank.
The State Bank actually.
The library is opposite us, on the corner.
That's right,
and there's a garage on the other street corner. I remember now.
So, you'll pick me up at 12.45
and we'll be there at one easily.
Now what should we take?
We must take them something.
I always think flowers are good to take to someone in hospital, don't you?
Well, not really.
Everyone always brings flowers and they don't last.
I think it's much better to take a pot plant,
so she can take it home with her.
Yes, but then she has to remember to water it.
What about a big box of chocolates?
Okay, chocolates sound fine.
We should get something for the baby too. What do you think?
Yes, you're right.
What do you think of something like baby shampoo or talcum powder?
Or we could get a little hat, or something like that.
We don't know the size, or the right colour, do we?
I think we should get something they wouldn't normally buy.
What about a soft toy of some sort?
Yes, a soft toy.
What about a teddy bear?
I could get one early tomorrow at the market
and I could probably get the chocolates there too.
Good.
So you'll pick me up at a quarter to one at my place
and I'll make sure that I've got the presents.
You must remember how much you paid for the gifts,
so I can pay you back for half.
If they're going to be from both of us, I would like to go shares.
Okay.
I'd say the chocolates would be about $15 for something nice and not too small
and the toy would be around $35 or so, I'd think.
Good, that'll be fine. About $25 each then.
Good, I'll pick you up then on Sunday at 12.45.
Okay.
See you then. Bye.

1259,Cam3 - Test 4 - Part 2,B2,cam3---test-4---part-2,56,"Good evening.
Tonight's show comes to you from the Good Home Exhibition in Duke's Court,
where we've been trying out some of the latest gadgets on show here
and getting our resident expert - Liz Shearer -
to tell us which ones are worth buying and which will die a death.
Well, hello.
Yes, John, I've been investigating four new household gadgets
and sorting out the advantages and disadvantages
and then really deciding what are 'Must buys',
what are 'Maybe buys' and what are 'Never buys'.
Let's start with this vacuum flask for keeping drinks hot.
I felt this had quite a lot going for it,
most of all is the fact that it contains no glass
and is therefore unbreakable to all intents and purposes.
It's made of stainless steel which is guaranteed for 20 years...
hope that's long enough...
and it's true what the manufacturer claims
that it does maintain heat for 18 hours.
So that's pretty good.
On the down side, it really works out to be quite expensive
and, much more surprisingly,
it unfortunately leaves a strange taste...
you know, when you've drunk from it...
so all in all, my recommendation would be it's got plenty of advantages,
but it is rather expensive so I'd say you should maybe buy it.
Moving on to a natty little device...
the Whistle Key Holder.
Basically this is where you whistle
and the key holder gives off a high pitched noise and flashes light
so you can find it.
One advantage of this model is that it also has a small light.
You press the button and this means you can find keyholes easily.
I also felt the small size was a real advantage.
On the weaker side, I did find the noise unpleasant.
Which I'm sure the designers could have done something about.
And I found that it didn't work through metal, so...
it's mainly used for finding in coat pockets, cushions, etc.
But taken as a whole I thought it was a masterpiece of design
and would highly recommend it.
The third gizmo is called the Army Flashlight
because it was developed initially for military use.
It works by squeezing the handle to generate the power.
Its advantages are that it can be used for outside activities,
and also... and, this is one of the surprising features...
it does work underwater.
My main objection to it though was, although it did work in these conditions,
this model gave off a weak light.
So my recommendation I'm afraid would have to be to avoid this one.
The decoy camera was last on my list.
This is a fake video camera which you fix to your wall to scare off burglars.
The advantage of this model is something which makes it look very realistic...
its flashing light.
On the down side, it was quite difficult to fix to the wall.
However, burglary is such a major problem these days that it is worth the effort, so...
this gets my strong recommendation.
Okay. Thanks for that, Liz.

1260,Cam3 - Test 4 - Part 3,B2,cam3---test-4---part-3,71,"Well, Amina, thanks for letting me have your draft in such good time.
Oh, that's alright.
I was just very anxious to hear what you think of it.
You can see that I decided to change the topic.
I had been interested in looking at Barings Factory.
Oh, I think the hospital was a much better choice.
In fact... well... I have to say that I thought it was good.
Oh?
There's still lots of work to be done...
Oh yes... of course.
But there's plenty of good ideas.
It opens well and the first chapter is fine
but the middle section really stood out for me... most interesting.
That's amazing
because I really didn't find it a bit easy to write...
How long did you work on the whole thing?
Well, I spent about two or three weeks reading and doing general research
and then I dashed the writing off very quickly...
so about four weeks in all.
Well, that's about par for the course.
You've got a while yet to make the changes.
Oh right... no problem...
Right. Let's have a look at my notes here.
Okay. Starting with section headings...
the broad divisions are good but you'll have to re-do the actual headings.
I've made some suggestions in the margins...
Okay. Thanks.
Now, this information on local housing...
I can see why you put it there
but it really isn't relevant to the approach you've taken.
I think I see what you mean.
Now... what did I say about the interviews?
I worked very hard on those.
I really thought they were valuable.
They are, Amina, but they're very complex and rather unclear at the moment.
You're going to have to spend a bit of time making the data a lot clearer.
Okay...
as long as I don't have to remove them altogether...
No, don't worry.
What about the chronology...
the list of dates?
I wasn't sure whether I should rewrite those.
My advice on that is to take them out. I feel it makes the whole piece appear too simplistic.
Okay, if it'll help.
Now, there are a couple of other books I'd like you to look at.
Have you got a pen?
Right... Approaches to Local History by John Mervis...
Right...
And then I think you need to think about ways of representing interview data.
Have a look at Sight and Sound by Kate Oakwell.
Sight and Sound.
Then you know I'm going away on holiday next week...
Yes.
So when you've made the changes, I suggest you show the work to your Support Tutor.
Support Tutor... right...
Then you do the proof reading...
Proof reading...
When by, do you think?
I'd aim for the 29th of June
and after that you should get it laser printed...
but be careful because the computer centre closes on 10 July.
And then I hand it in to...?
Oh, the Faculty Office as usual.
Okay, that's fine.
I think I'm all set now!
Thanks very much for all your help.
A pleasure.
See you when I get back.
Yep. Thanks, Dr Bryson.
Bye.
Bye.

1261,Cam3 - Test 4 - Part 4,C1,cam3---test-4---part-4,66,"Good afternoon.
I'm Paula Bundell
and I am giving you the lectures on Environmental Noise this term.
Today we are going to look into the effects of noise on a planned housing estate
in a particularly difficult part of the new Manchester Park area.
This site is not as bad as some I have researched in the past.
The Blacktown airport is closed from 6 pm to 7 am
and this is a great advantage to the site.
The only noise after dark is from the highway
and the traffic is somewhat reduced between 7.30 pm and 5.30 am.
So, the people most affected by the noise will be, I expect, housewives.
By the time most of the students and workers have arrived back home in the evening during the week,
the noise will have abated to a fairly large extent.
The weekends are still a problem of course,
but the traffic is certainly reduced on Saturdays to a large extent
and even more so on Sundays.
Of course, modifications to houses will be necessary at a site like this
and they come at a significant cost to the developer and home buyer.
The modifications I am about to outline
will add about $25,000 to the price of a newly-built house.
That will still mean a cheaper house than in a less noisy and more desirable area.
A bit of background would not go astray.
I understand that you are all familiar with the proposed development site at Manchester Park.
It's a particularly difficult one in terms of noise
with the highway along the eastern perimeter
and the Blacktown airport not 3 kilometres away to the north.
Of course, those nearest the highway will be the worst hit,
with heavy traffic noise as well as the noise from the light planes overhead.
As you all know, the normal noise threshold for private housing is 55 decibels.
At this site the levels have been recorded as high as 67 decibels.
The construction of the houses has to be somewhat modified from houses in most areas.
In the houses on the highway and in the noisiest areas of this site
there will be a need for specialised double glazing
and special acoustic seals will have to be fitted to the doors.
All exterior doors in this especially noisy pocket
will have to be solid core wood doors with hinges.
Every house built on this site,
not just those adjacent to the highway or nearest to the airport,
will require high density insulation materials in the roof.
Not only will all the roofs need insulating,
the exterior walls will be required to be double brick.
All ceilings will require double thickness plaster board to be used in the construction.
In the noisiest areas, mechanical ventilation will have to be installed in the exterior walls.
In those areas with sealed windows
it will be necessary to fit fans with absorbers to cut out the noise in those particular houses.
Air conditioning units could also be fitted in the ceilings of such houses
but this is substantially more expensive than fans,
and may not be needed on this site.
Coming back now to the double glazing I mentioned before.
Specialised double glazing requires a larger air gap
between the inner and outer glass than normal double glazing.
The gap must be at least 7 centimetres.
The thickness of the glass is also a factor,
8 millimetres on the outside and 6 on the inside pane.
It's essential that the glass be thicker on the outside than on the inside
and that the gap between the panes of glass be a minimum of 7 centimetres.
Obviously, the noise factor will have to be taken into consideration with the layout of the houses.
Living areas will have to be designed at the back of the houses away from the highway.
Bedrooms and living rooms will have to be built towards the back,
and for those houses closest to the highway
two layers of plasterboard will be needed for the interior bedroom walls.
Those rooms constructed at the front of the houses
should be garages, laundries, kitchens, bathrooms and dining rooms.
I have come to the conclusion that this development should go ahead,
but with various acoustic modifications according to the position of the block
in relation to the highway and intersection.

1262,IELTS Recent Actual Test 1 - Part 1,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-1---part-1,79,"Well, we have this school excursion planned, but when exactly is it?
Is it this Tuesday or Wednesday?
Well it can‚Äôt be Tuesday, with the English tests taking place.
Ah, right. Not Tuesday, but Wednesday.
That‚Äôs right - all day Wednesday - taking a bus outside the city.
And where are we going?
Ah, last month we went to Arthur Island,
so this time we‚Äôre going to the... Animal Park
Arthur Island was okay, but it was too cold.
Let‚Äôs hope the weather for this week‚Äôs excursion is better.
I don‚Äôt suppose animals care about bad weather, but I certainly do.
Have you heard the forecast?
Yes, and it‚Äôs not too bad.
Basically, they‚Äôre saying Monday will be sunny.
Good...
But then the weather will change.
Not so good.
Yes, Tuesday we'll have some showers,
but by Wednesday, the day of our excursion, it will be...
well, their words are ""cold and cloudy"".
Cold and cloudy. Well, as long as it isn‚Äôt ‚Äòwet and rainy‚Äô, I‚Äôm happy enough.
We won‚Äôt need umbrellas, just warm clothing.
And what time will we get there?
Let‚Äôs see. The bus picks us up at 8:30 am,
and then it‚Äôs an hour and a half on the road, so we arrive at 10 a.m...
sorry, with the 15-minute break, that will actually be 10:15 a.m.
That‚Äôs early enough.
Then all our students can see the animals, have their fun, and do whatever they want to do.
Well, one fun event planned that day is 'Birds of Prey'.
What‚Äôs that?
That‚Äôs when they bring out several birds of prey:
eagles, falcons, kites, those sorts of birds,
and throw pieces of meat into the air,
and the birds swoop down and eat them.
It‚Äôs quite impressive.
Sounds great. 'Birds of Prey'.
Are there any other activities?
There‚Äôs a catered lunch, at the park restaurant.
We‚Äôve already paid for that, and in the afternoon there‚Äôs...
well, I had a choice between the ‚ÄòReptile Display‚Äô and the ‚ÄòKoala Handling‚Äô.
In the reptile display, the students can handle live pythons and various other snakes.
Surely they‚Äôd rather hold koalas?
I‚Äôm sure, but the koalas can‚Äôt be handled unless the weather‚Äôs sunny, and given the forecast,
I thought it better to choose the reptile display.
Ummm, that‚Äôs a shame.
These Asian students would love the ‚ÄòKoala Handling‚Äô.
Yes, I know, but we can‚Äôt control the weather.
And, then we get back. What time will that be?
We leave the park at 4:30, but then we face traffic,
so we won‚Äôt get back until well after 6 pm.
It will most likely be 6:30.
But that‚Äôs better than the last trip: we didn‚Äôt get home until 8:30 that time.
Yes, that was a bit too late, wasn‚Äôt it?
Andrew, I understand you‚Äôve been doing some research regarding the breakdown, by nationality of our student body.
That must've produced some interesting results.
You‚Äôre right. I got some statistics from head office.
I would imagine that most of our students are either Japanese or Chinese.
You imagine right.
But it‚Äôs the Chinese who constitute the majority, but only just.
I had thought Koreans might be second,
but it‚Äôs actually the Japanese, quite close behind.
It‚Äôs somewhat surprising, but obviously all those Study Tours that our university markets in Japan are bringing in students.
What‚Äôs the breakdown exactly?
Japanese are a quarter of the whole, which is considerable.
Last year they were only 16%, so that market has grown nicely.
Ah, the only other proportions of some weight are the Indonesians and Koreans - about the same.
Indonesians at 15%, and...
the Koreans are a little higher -
not like last year when they were less than 10%.
I thought we‚Äôd have more Indonesians than Koreans?
Well, as I said, they‚Äôre about the same
just like the Saudi and Thai student numbers, almost the same also -
both just under 10.
Which one is bigger?
Thai students number just a fraction more.
As for the other nationalities, collectively they‚Äôre only 3%,
so it wasn‚Äôt worth giving each of them a separate category.
I just grouped them under ‚Äòother‚Äô
that‚Äôs Vietnamese, South American, a couple of Russians, and so on.

1263,IELTS Recent Actual Test 1 - Part 2,B1,ielts-recent-actual-test-1---part-2,71,"Hello everyone.
Now, you‚Äôre here because you‚Äôre interested in travel, right?
And you‚Äôre in the right place,
for at EasyTravel, we have the best deals for the best locations.
We specialise in eco-travel,
or holidays designed to get you amongst nature,
ignoring the hustle and bustle of big cities.
So, whether you want to hike in Nepal, as many people do,
or follow some jungle paths in the rainforests of Queensland,
we can give you the best deal.
If you look at our office here, you‚Äôll see our overseas consultants.
That‚Äôs for trips overseas, obviously, to Europe, to North America,
but primarily for the Asian market,
which is generally more popular in this part of the world.
Most people like that touch of the Orient, right?
But they also like the domestic market,
since this country offers its fair share of beautiful natural vistas.
What about the deserts, anyone?
What about some striking red-rock gorges?
Then, talk to our domestic consultants, who can arrange anything you want.
But they deal with the accounts in the morning,
so you‚Äôll need to talk to them in the afternoon.
And remember, our office doesn‚Äôt open at night, sorry to say.
Now, around the outskirts and outer regions of this city,
there are many beautiful places that you might not be aware of.
And the advantages of these regional locations are many.
Mostly, by being closer, some of them can be done in a day tour.
Yes, it‚Äôs fast and convenient, with none of those long-haul bus trips
which often leave you cramped and uncomfortable,
and stuffing heavy suitcases into luggage racks.
But, I should tell you about our buses,
those that are needed for the somewhat more distant holiday destinations.
They definitely do not suffer from those problems I just mentioned.
We use the services of the famous Sleek Line Company,
whose buses are known as the very best.
Yes, they are big, yes, they are comfortable,
but what makes them especially different is the personal attendant,
who accompanies the driver, ready and willing to serve you,
and ensure that your trip is the very best.
So, whether it‚Äôs overseas or local, we can certainly give you what you want.
Now, do you have any questions?
Right, let me orient you to our main EasyTravel office here.
On this table right beside us are travel magazines for you to browse through,
and on the wall next to that are many more, for all parts of the world.
Our four travel consultants sit over there, on the other side of that long counter.
That‚Äôs right, four of them, side by side,
all serving various regions.
Now, let me tell you their specific functions.
Firstly, the consultant on the left, next to the plant,
is the ‚ÄòLocal Tours‚Äô consultant,
serving tours in the immediate vicinity of this city.
Next to her is what we call ‚ÄòRegional Tours‚Äô,
targeting the state-wide options.
Next- to her is the ‚ÄòInterstate-Tours‚Äô,
and that can involve either buses or planes,
in the former case, utilising the SleekLine Bus service, as you know.
And finally, next to her, in the corner, is ‚ÄòGeneral Enquiries‚Äô,
which is self-explanatory.
If you have questions of a general nature,
rather than one relating to specific destinations, you can go there.
Now, as I said, we can do international tours,
and for that you need our big office, just through that door -
the one between those two plants.
However, if your international tour is in the Asian region,
which is generally our most popular option,
then we deal with that in a separate room
the one opposite International Tours, but not; the corner one.
Just go through that door on the left - the one next to that cupboard.
The door next to that is, in fact, our General Office,

1264,IELTS Recent Actual Test 1 - Part 3,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-1---part-3,91,"Hi Liz. How do you feel about starting university here?
A little bit nervous, but I‚Äôm confident I can handle it.
This orientation program seems like it will help us a lot.
Sure. I‚Äôm looking at the timetable here myself.
It seems that there are choices available.
I can see.
So, what are you going to do Monday afternoon?
In the morning we all have the opening lecture,
but it looks like we have a choice later that day, as you said.
Well, the ‚ÄòCareers Lecture‚Äô might be helpful,
but I am interested in the ‚ÄòUni Tour‚Äô.
It‚Äôs probably too early to be thinking of careers now, anyway,
and I want to know what‚Äôs what at this new university, so I‚Äôm doing the tour.
Alright. I‚Äôll come along with you.
Might learn something interesting.
After all, we haven‚Äôt seen much of this place yet,
and we will be spending four years here.
Tuesday is another full day, too.
In the afternoon there‚Äôs a lecture about study skills,
but that morning offers another choice.
‚ÄòLibrary Tour‚Äô or ‚ÄòStudent Union Induction‚Äô.
What do you think?
I think the student union is very important,
but we can go there any time, right,
so we should take advantage of the library tour while it‚Äôs being offered.
Maybe the week after, you and I can go to the student union.
Library it is, then.
Now, Wednesday has a free session in the morning,
but after lunch there‚Äôs a choice between visiting the computer lab,
or attending a lecture on our legal rights.
Well, law and rights are important,
but computers are the basis of everything these days,
so I‚Äôm going to the computer lab.
Don‚Äôt you think knowing our legal rights is equally, if not more, important?
We live in a very litigious and complex society now.
Sure, but it‚Äôs something we can pick up later,
so let‚Äôs leave that one out.
Okay.
Let me see the timetable.
Thursday is a free day, and the week winds up with some celebrations on Friday afternoon.
It looks like a fun choice, too.
There‚Äôs either a BBQ on the main lawn, or the dance.
I never pass up the chance to eat something. What about you?
If I can get a free meal, I‚Äôll take it any day,
and I‚Äôm not good at dancing anyway.
Well, that‚Äôs that decided. Right?
Right!
Guess what Liz?
There‚Äôs another interesting thing in this orientation booklet,
and it looks important - about a ‚Äòstyle guide‚Äô.
What‚Äôs that?
Take a look yourself.
It seems to be a set of rules regarding how to present written work -
essays, and that sort of thing - to the lecturers.
They want a uniform style of presentation.
I can see. So, everything we hand in must have a header and a footer.
A what?
A header and a footer.
The footer is at the bottom of the page, and the header is at the very top.
That‚Äôs why they call it a ‚Äòheader‚Äô, you know,
that little bit of writing giving details about the work.
And they also want the word count.
Why do they need that?
I guess because the lecturers will specify the number of words they want for their assignment,
and they want to be sure students follow this.
And even the heading on the page has to be a specific dimension.
16 points, and bold print, and underlined.
And subheadings are 14 points, and the font has to be Arial for everything.
Yes, the main text is Arial, too, as you said, and the size is 12 points,
with the header and footer being slightly smaller, at 10 points each.
Well, it seems logical.
The size of everything is in proportion to its importance,
but why do they need the spacing of the main text to be one and a half?
The header and footer are different.
They‚Äôre only single-spaced.
Probably to allow the teacher to insert comments, or corrections,
or just to make it all more readable, I suppose.
And we need wide margins on the left, right, top, and bottom,
probably for the same reason.
Lots of space to allow the addition of comments.
That‚Äôs a bit scary, actually.
It seems to assume we will be making mistakes.
And look what they want in the header and footer.
The header has the name of the work.
Not the name of the teacher?
No, the work, but surely the teacher‚Äôs name must go somewhere.
Ah, here it is. It goes in the footer.
Okay, I‚Äôd say this is all logical.
If a page is lost, say, falls to the floor,
then with all this information, it can always be traced back to the teacher involved.
Right - as you say, all very logical.

1265,IELTS Recent Actual Test 1 - Part 4,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-1---part-4,65,"Most of us are familiar with a local park.
We spend time there, play there, and have some of our best memories in these places.
But what is a park?
Basically, it can be defined as a natural, or at least semi-natural, piece of land,
planted with a variety of trees, bushes, and flowers,
protected and reserved for the enjoyment of all citizens.
There are usually regulations about the sorts of behaviour that can take place within.
And sometimes there are facilities such as children's playgrounds,
or fields for ball games and other sorts of activities.
For this reason, if there is grass, it is kept short,
and this also discourages the breeding of insect pests.
A well-maintained park actually needs a lot of people to look after it,
and more so if the park showcases special plants,
flowers, or trees, in which case it is called a 'botanic garden'.
In complete contrast, if the park is big and remote enough,
it is sometimes designated as a wilderness park,
to be left completely alone and untouched,
protected from all development in order to allow wild species,
both plant and animal, to live undisturbed.
But it is the urban park - the sort of park that most people are familiar with,
that I want to talk about now.
These preserve natural landscapes for the pleasure of the urban population,
most commonly just for passive recreation
in other words, allowing people just to observe the trees, and lie in the grass,
and such passive recreation is certainly needed.
Continuing on the subject of parks,
it might surprise you to know that once there were none.
A thousand years ago, there was no need,
since there were already extensive open spaces,
forests, and wilderness surrounding most cities and towns - for example, in Europe.
These dark dank forests were large and even dangerous,
full of wild animals and with the potentially fatal result of getting lost.
Hence, fairy tales evolved about witches living in these areas,
and the wolves and bears, which could threaten young children.
However, with the rapidly increasing human population,
the original wilderness and natural open spaces were intruded upon.
Forests were cut down as populations spread,
and with them, urban pollution and further deforestation.
But it was only with the advent of the Industrial Revolution
that people realised natural areas needed to be preserved,
to give the populace access to the sort of nature that was fast disappearing
due to the uncontrolled development and demand for resources.
The first park, expressly designed for that purpose,
is usually considered to be Princes Park in Liverpool.
This was in 1841, on land donated to the public by a rich iron merchant.
With such a generous donation (worth about ¬£50,000),
the council decided to invest ¬£5,000 of its own money in making it look good.
Consequently, they hired a landscape designer, Joseph Paxton,
who designed twisting turning pathways among shade-giving trees,
all based around a central lake.
In many ways, it became the prototype for all later large parks,
including the famous Central Park in New York.
But, if we were to pick the park that most people are familiar with,
it would be the much smaller neighbourhood park.
These can be tiny, but, by being in the midst of extensive development and dense populations,
they are increasingly seen as a refuge,
where one can get a glimpse of true nature.
Many psychologists now maintain that this glimpse is necessary,
for ultimately, as a species, we have an innate affinity for nature,
and the concrete urban zoo clashes with our inner being.
This has seen the rejuvenation of many urban parks that were once left to decay,
for example, in New York or London,
and indeed, some cities, such as Melbourne,
are known all over the world for their abundance of carefully maintained parks,
including a world famous botanic garden.

1266,IELTS Recent Actual Test 2 - Part 1,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-2---part-1,80,"Okay Mary, I know I'm putting on weight with all my bad eating habits.
That's right. Chocolate bars, pizzas, and all washed down with litres of soft drink.
And with all the sugar in soft drink,
I think we can say you're definitely overindulging, don't you think?
I know, I know.
I intend to definitely stop drinking that from now on.
And that's part of the sensible eating plan that we have agreed we need to formulate -
one that we can both follow.
That's right, sensible, and practical -
allowing us to indulge in some sweet foods on occasions.
On rare occasions,
and we're going to cut out all the pizzas and hamburgers.
Well, not totally.
I thought you said pizzas could be eaten once a week.
You know how I like pizzas.
No. I said once every two months.
Once a week was ice cream, not pizza.
Yeah, that's because you like ice cream.
I prefer pizza.
Peter, if you want to lose weight, you need to be disciplined,
in both what you eat, and what you do,
which brings us to the issue of exercise.
That's right.
So, jogging twice a week, and hiking on Saturdays, right?
No, hiking is Sundays,
allowing Saturdays for the light walking exercise.
I've investigated, and discovered there are a lot of walking trails around this suburb,
with many beautiful places if you just look around.
So what's happening this Saturday?
A walk around the city?
That's later in the month.
This Saturday we'll visit Pine Park.
Hill Park is nicer, with great views, too.
Yes, but we have to travel too far to reach Hill Park,
so I ruled that out, and I love the smell of pines.
And what about the weekday meals?
Salads every night, I suppose?
No, it's important to vary the meals so that the food remains interesting and fun.
The only common factor is the fruit juice,
but otherwise we'll have a variety of healthy fare,
from salads, to fish, to lean meat.
I'd rather have meat every night, but you're the boss.
If you want to lose weight, you'll have to accept this program, okay?
Okay.
Now Mary, you said we could have a little treat in our diet plan three times a week:
specifically, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays.
Yes. A very small treat, but something to reward us for all the discipline shown.
Such rewards will motivate us to continue the diet.
So, on Tuesdays, what can I choose?
You have a choice between a small serving of chocolate, ice cream, or biscuits.
Okay, well, I'll go for the biscuits.
I love those crunchy little things with my cup of tea.
So do you, right?
I do indeed, so I'll have them, too, saving the ice cream for later.
But I know how much you like ice cream,
so why don't you save it for the end of the week?
That will give you the motivation to keep going,
and you can have chocolate midweek?
That's a good idea,
but I think the most important thing is for you and I to eat different things on those other two days.
Well, if you think that way,
I'll eat the ice cream on Thursdays, not the chocolate. Okay?
Well, if you're having that, then I can't have ice cream.
In order to be different, I'll have the chocolate.
So, we can compare our different snacks,
and maybe even share a little with each other.
Exactly! And the variety and fun involved will take our minds of wanting more.
Eating for fun! A good idea!
And then you can have the chocolate on Sunday, right?
But I like biscuits?
Actually, I want biscuits again - to have with my cup of tea.
But you have the biscuits on Monday, remember, and we can't repeat.
Ah come on! This isn't fixed in concrete.
I can have them again instead of chocolate.
You might like variety, but I don't.
I'm a creature of habit.
Well, the whole point of this was to taste different snacks,
but if you want the same thing, okay.
I, for one, am sticking to the original plan,
with ice cream to finish the week, and not another dose of chocolate.

1267,IELTS Recent Actual Test 2 - Part 2,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-2---part-2,57,"Hello everyone, and welcome to the Stanfield Childcare Centre.
Now I know you're all new mothers, and you like to cling to your children.
You've certainly spent a lot of time raising them to the age of four
and are perhaps reluctant to leave them here at our centre.
Well, one of the first things you should understand is that here it is safe - very safe.
Look around and you'll see that every room has padded walls.
Other centres have standard painted walls,
but here, we have invested a lot to ensure your children will not hurt themselves
when running around and possibly tripping over.
This padding extends around all corners
that is, the areas most likely to bruise and cut your active little child.
So, you can rest assured that any accidents of a physical nature are not likely to happen here.
Now, you don't want to dump your child at this centre and let them waste their time.
You want them to learn, and that's one of the greatest assets of our establishment.
Our staff are not only trained childcare workers,
but all of them have a special skill, which they can impart to your child,
whether it be teaching the ABC, some basic mathematics,
artistic skills, or physical education.
We are particularly known for our pre-school literacy program
and have a wealth of learning toys, specially designed to develop your child's potential.
Of course, one concern many mothers have is that,
in environments such as these,
colds and flus and other viral nasties can be easily spread around.
It's a very legitimate concern,
and one which we take seriously,
and we pride ourselves on our precautions.
For a start, unlike most centres which clean with standard detergents,
we disinfect every surface at the end of every day,
using a special disinfectant wash.
Some places just wipe surfaces daily with a damp cloth,
but not us. And that's just the start.
We also physically check your children when they arrive every day,
and if we feel your child is sick,
we ask him or her to wear a face mask to ensure germs are not transmitted.
If your child is noticeably sick, then we ask you to take them back home to recover.
This might sound a little unkind,
but we hope parents can understand that these measures are for the benefit of all.
Now, at Stanfield Childcare Centre we have excellent childcare officers,
and let me briefly introduce them.
We have Susan, Andrea, Bella, Cathy, Lisa, and Liz.
They're all fully trained and come with some individual assets which make them even better.
Bella, for instance, knows children very well, having worked here for five years,
and Cathy has her own family - two little girls
so she can talk to you with first-hand knowledge of what it's really like to raise children.
But getting back to Bella, she often relaxes here after work,
spending long hours chatting to parents, as does Cathy in fact.
But in terms of hours, nothing can compare to Andrea,
who will sometimes spend the night here, staying in our overnight room.
Why? Because this centre is very friendly, and simply a great place to be.
Bella, for example, used to be quite shy herself
but now is marvelous with the little kiddies, as outgoing as any of them.
We let Cathy, though, deal with the particularly quiet and introverted children,
since having her own family, she knows what can really bring them out.
Of course, what better way to do this than with yummie homemade cakes,
and Cathy often gets these from Bella, who can make some of the best in town.
Yes, everyone here brings something special,
which is why we're one of the best childcare centres in the business.

1268,IELTS Recent Actual Test 2 - Part 3,C1,ielts-recent-actual-test-2---part-3,87,"Hi, Ms Harris. Here we are, talking once again.
Well, I'm always willing to help out wherever possible.
Is anything troubling you?
Well, your advice last week about writing summaries was very useful,
and I'm using these summaries a lot in order to prepare my final master's thesis.
But you're having problems, right?
Yes, I have a few issues to discuss.
Obviously I want a good essay, and I want to achieve high marks.
But I'm not sure on the best way to start.
That's an easy question.
Start with a topic, but not one that I necessarily suggest,
but one that you want to explore.
You'll always write better when doing so on a topic you're interested in,
not one imposed upon you by others.
Well, I'm interested in management theory.
Then pursue that.
However, that alone is far too broad.
Break it into various current areas of discussion and relevance,
then look more carefully at one of them -
say, management and cultural differences,
or management and motivation,
or other aspects, such as the role of salary, group cohesion, or leadership.
I would say I'm interested in group cohesion,
that is, how people interact in the workplace.
Well, that's a start,
but you can't then just write planlessly,
without defining exactly what you intend to do within the area you've chosen.
You'll have to think of a thesis, and this statement could be of several types.
Such as what?
Oh, you could argue a point, something that you believe in;
or discuss an issue, looking at its various perspectives;
or critique the opinions of others, pointing out the pitfalls and flaws.
The thesis statement will make that very clear because it will say,
in simple terms, what you intend to achieve in your essay.
I see. And then I can just begin writing, right?
Wrong!
If your essay is going to be clear, it needs to be logical and organised,
and this means you'll need an outline.
This could be written as a flowchart, or spider graph,
that is, a series of connected lines,
but whatever shape the outline takes,
there must be a sense of progress, in, more or less, a straight line, towards a goal.
And then my essay will be good?
With such progression, definitely
as long as you do achieve everything that you set out to do,
as specified in the beginning, okay?
Well, Ms Harris, your advice about essay writing all sounds very useful:
solid, and step by step, so I'll certainly follow that.
But can you tell me in more general terms,
what constitutes the best essay?
Oh, there are many aspects to consider,
but one of the most important is certainly, original thinking.
The best essays are written by people who think for themselves,
and not just copy or imitate established views.
I think I can do that.
But remember, you can't just give a list of unsupported assertions.
There needs to be support as well -
a chain of logic linking each step in your argument.
Right!
Yet that alone is not enough.
Your argument may be logically sound, but is it practically so?
For that, you need examples, from real-life, to illustrate your points or sub-points.
I've got lots of examples from my course readings.
I suppose I could use them.
But remember, whenever you use an example,
or facts or figures that are not commonly known,
you must give a reference.
That's an academic necessity, without which your writing will automatically fail.
So, it's necessary to give these. Right.
Absolutely! And with that, your essay will be fine,
but always ensure that you format it clearly.
What do you mean?
I mean the practical considerations,
as written in the university style guide,
such as leaving appropriate margins,
using double spacing, Arial font, and so on.
You see, your writing must look good, as well as be good.
I can certainly do that.
And, finally, related to the previous point,
you need to respect the number of words required.
Your individual lecturers will give you a word-count figure,
so follow what they say, making your essay neither too long, nor too short,
perhaps 10% either way should be acceptable.
15% was common when I was younger,
but it's a lot stricter now,
and 20% would be pushing the boundaries just a little too far.
I guess I can do all that. Thanks for your advice.

1269,IELTS Recent Actual Test 2 - Part 4,C2,ielts-recent-actual-test-2---part-4,65,"In the night sky, the stars appear to revolve around the Earth,
rising in the east, and disappearing in the west.
The Earth itself seems solid, fixed, and stable,
and such common sense perception suggests that the Earth is the centre of the universe.
This is known as ""geocentrism"", with geo meaning Earth,
and all pre-modern civilisations drew this conclusion.
We now know, of course, that the Earth revolves around the sun,
and this is called ""heliocentrism"", with helio meaning sun,
but historically, it took quite a while for this to be deduced.
As early as the third century BC,
an ancient Greek astronomer, Aristarchus of Samos,
proposed heliocentrism, but received little support from his peers.
Similarly, throughout subsequent history, isolated individuals proposed this new idea,
but again, no one was listening.
Geocentrism just seemed too logical to refute.
Geocentrism also fitted the views of the established Christian church,
who could quote biblical passages such as 'the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved'.
Those who dared to disagree were subject to accusations of heresy
often with dire punishments to follow.
The trouble was, as the night sky was observed more closely,
that simple revolution of the stars proved not so simple at all.
In relation to the other stars, some steadily wandered in given directions,
then sometimes reversed for months, and disappeared altogether.
They were called planets, meaning 'wanderers'.
In addition, the position of the sun and moon altered slightly over the year,
and comets, those mysterious glowing spots, would come and go.
In order to predict the motion of the planets,
and accurately serve the primary purpose of navigation for sailing ships,
increasingly elaborate mathematical models were needed -
a sure sign that something was not quite right.
Heliocentrism, or the belief that the sun is the centre of the solar system,
still needed a mathematically-sound description before it could be scientifically accepted,
and it was a Polish astronomer, Nicolaus Copernicus,
who, in 1543, first published this.
This event is sometimes referred to as the Copernican revolution.
Copernicus himself certainly feared the consequences of his proof,
knowing full well it might invoke the anger of the established church.
Probably for this reason, he waited until the last year of his life,
when he was sick and dying, to release his findings.
In addition, the preface of the book,
written by a respected member of the church,
stated that the model was not necessarily correct.
As a result of this, there was no ""revolution"" whatsoever,
in fact, the book received scant attention in the subsequent decades,
apart from a few irate clergy men who angrily dismissed the whole scheme as irrelevant.
Yet the following generations of astronomers did not always fare so well.
The Italian scientist, Galileo, got into trouble,
as did a fellow Italian, with the surname Bruno, Giordono Bruno,
who was burnt at the stake,
yet ultimately, nothing could slow the spread of heliocentrism across Europe.
It formed the basis of Isaac Newton's great work on the motion of the planets,
a work which implied that even the sun, around which the Earth circled,
was itself in motion around a common centre of gravity.
No discourse about heliocentrism could finish without mentioning that,
somewhat unbelievably, there still exists those today who choose to believe that the Earth is the centre of the universe.
Modern geocentrism is usually the result of literal interpretations of the Bible,
which is the cornerstone of these people's beliefs.
They, therefore, also believe in creationism,
that is, that a God created everything,
and while we may smile at this,
it is sobering to consider that surveys have revealed that up to 10% of British people,
12% of Europeans. 20% of the USA,
and 25% of the Middle East,
still hold the belief that the sun revolves around the Earth.
One can only wonder what Copernicus would have thought of this.

1270,IELTS Recent Actual Test 3 - Part 1,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-3---part-1,81,"Hello. Is this the Triple A Employment agency?
Yes.
Hi. I rang before. My name's Andrew. Andrew Peterson.
I rang you earlier and gave you my personal details.
If you remember, I'm that student looking for work during the summer holidays.
Oh, sure. Actually, I have your file right here.
But... we still need to add some further information.
Yeah, that's what they told me, and that's why I'm ringing.
What do you need to know?
Well, we have to know your main level of education. It's a degree, I suppose.
Yes, but I'm still doing it, in engineering. It's quite interesting.
Some of my friends are studying computing though, so I'm interested in that, also.
Well, I'll just write in your main degree subject. Engineering.
We usually have a demand in computing though.
Have you worked with computers before?
No. I just do some programming for fun at the university,
but I almost got a job as a computer designer once.
Actually, the only job I've ever had was as a car salesman, believe it or not.
Well, at least you've had experience dealing with customers.
What about hobbies though?
Sometimes they can help develop useful skills.
Ummm... in my free time I don't do much - mostly study.
I play chess occasionally at the university chess club.
That's right next to the tennis courts,
but I'm not interested in that.
Chess helps develop analytical skills, so I'll put that down.
Of course, it's your main skills that employers want to know about
What would you say they are?
Well, I'm in my third year now, studying electrical machines and generating systems,
but I'd say electronics is my best skill
much better than, say, my machine skills, which aren't so good, actually.
Okay... machine skills are in demand, but so too are electronic ones,
so we might be able to find you a part-time job in that field.
But what sort of money do you expect to get?
Oh, anything really.
I'd want the standard payment, let's say.
What's normal? 1,000 a month? 1,500?
I'll just put $1,200, okay?
That's fine by me.
When can you start? Say, within two days?
Easily! Actually, less.
In fact, just give me a ring, and I'll be able to start immediately,
although I admit it'll take me a few days to get used to getting up early in the morning.
Okay! That's just about it,
unless you'd like to add anything else which may help with your application?
Ah, not really.
I ride a motorbike, but that's unimportant.
I'm friendly, but every applicant claims that, right?
I can speak another language.
Ah, that might be useful, depending on the language.
Is it Chinese? A Chinese speaker would go down well.
Spanish, I'm afraid.
You see, I grew up with some friends who came from South America.
Okay, I'll write that down, but I don't think it will help that much, sorry to say.
Well, thanks for your help, and hopefully I'll get a job soon,
but can I just ask one more question?
Sure!
What, basically, are employers looking for when they interview someone?
Oh, many things.
Being hardworking, diligent, and focused on your job is good,
but surprisingly, it often means you can't see the bigger picture,
or provide suggestions which help the company move forward.
That requires thinking for yourself, outside the box as they say,
and being free of the standard ways of approaching tasks.
Employers certainly value that.
I guess experience must help, though?
It depends. If it involved a routine job, one which didn't exercise your mind,
it might not mean that much at all.
But since companies are basically composed of people,
it is important to be able to get along with others.
There's no point in hiring someone whom the other employees don't like, right?
That just causes problems,
in fact, I would say that being friendly and approachable ranks far more highly than your academic qualifications.
Okay, and that's all assessed at the interview, right?
Yes, and your qualifications, experience, and approach to the job,
such as whether you can do different things, work overtime, or do long hours as needed.
But those latter qualities are pretty much standard.
What may be more important is based on the fact that things inevitably go wrong.
Mistakes are made, and someone's got to fix them in a way that creates the least disturbance.
People with demonstrated abilities to do this are certainly regarded highly.

1271,IELTS Recent Actual Test 3 - Part 2,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-3---part-2,58,"Hello everyone, and welcome to the ""Fit for Life"" Health Centre,
a place which, as the name suggests, is not just for short-term solutions,
but rather, intends to put you on a sensible and achievable footing for the rest of your life.
And that's how we're different.
For example, we could immediately put you on a harsh exercise program,
expecting you to work out every day, but such a plan would see you quickly lose interest.
That's why the initial step is a one-and-a-half-hour consultation,
in which your lifestyle, current situation, and long-term goals, are all thoroughly analysed.
Now, an important part of this consultation involves analysing what you eat.
There's no point exercising here, and losing weight, then putting it all back on, later.
You will need to show self-control and discipline in your diet, and we'll work on that.
Similarly, we'll put you on an exercise regime suitable for your level of fitness,
so that will involve a test, where we will take you through some activities,
then measure your heart rate and blood pressure to determine how fit you are.
This will be monitored during every subsequent consultation,
along with your exercise schedule,
and that occurs monthly, and not half-yearly, as with many other centres.
As to our actual exercise machines and programs,
you will have to decide whether it is muscle mass,
stamina, or general fitness, that you want to develop.
Think about which of these three you want to target,
and we'll design a specific program for you,
but remember, bulging muscles aren't necessarily suitable for everyone.
Sometimes it's better to think in terms of two simple concepts:
muscle definition and stamina;
or, if you are female, being fit and healthy, in both mind and body.
Now, if you're going to work out at this gym,
you'll need to think about your reasons for exercising,
so let's consider that in more detail.
Muscle mass is certainly popular with the guys, probably seeking, to impress the girls,
and with muscles comes the confidence to do that, right?
Well, for that, you'll need our high-stress weight units, where pumping iron is all the rage.
Moving on to other benefits, one of the main ones is beating the tension of life, right,
and the longer the exercise is, the greater the rewards in this respect.
Thus, playing squash can certainly help, and so can swimming,
but what's much better, as every jogger will tell you, is their activity,
so we have ample jogging machines, and they're always popular.
They can provide good fitness too, as can the yoga classes;
however, again, let's not forget playing squash,
which, I would say, is the optimum way to improve your general wellbeing.
Such an active, energetic game, plus the competitive element,
drives you forward into high levels of health and fitness.
These, of course, are the ultimate purposes of being here,
but remember, the centre is full of like-minded people,
all of whom are interesting to meet, and valuable sources of information.
The yoga classes have a pre- and post-meeting session,
so you'll certainly meet others there,
although they'll all be yoga enthusiasts,
which limits the range somewhat.
But whether doing yoga, swimming, or exercising, everyone showers, right,
so those facilities are where you'll hear all sorts of interesting conversations, and really get to know people
not like the front-desk area,
which is mostly empty as patrons go immediately inside to do their exercise.
Of course, the front desk can answer all your questions,
and has information brochures, and such like,
but for knowing more about a greater variety of subjects and community concerns,
look at the notice board in the yoga studio,
where there's a huge array of papers, leaflets, and articles, all for you to read and consider.

1272,IELTS Recent Actual Test 3 - Part 3,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-3---part-3,85,"Okay, we've got to decide who to promote to Leading Education Officer.
Someone from the arts faculty, I suppose.
Well, it can be from any faculty, since the position requires more general skills:
handling personnel, settling disputes, and motivating them to focus on the task.
It was the last position which involved computer knowledge, not this one.
Surely computer knowledge would help.
So too would knowledge in the arts.
Sure, it would help, but the key criterion is being able to direct the staff appropriately.
So, it doesn't matter then from which faculty we select our candidates?
Not really, but I've already looked at those from computing, and rejected them all.
Why?
They're all too new, lacking in sufficient experience,
whereas these ones from the business faculty are longtimers,
so we'll take someone from there.
I suppose you're right.
The arts faculty doesn't present much in the way of suitable candidates either.
But we'll still have to train the person - teach the ropes, as they say.
And he or she will have to expect to do overtime, as needed.
Of course. It can get so busy that, if we were open on the weekend,
they'd have to work then as well.
Just as well we're a Monday to Friday university, right?
Right!
But are you sure these people will actually want the job?
The salary isn't such an improvement on their current ones.
I know, but there are benefits.
You get overtime rates, a nice place to put your car,
as well as additional petrol money if you drive for company purposes,
which they'll probably be required to do.
But those benefits are quite limited,
especially given all the work and responsibility involved.
People often don't like that.
They prefer the creative freedom of less-senior teaching positions.
Yeah I know,
but these candidates should realise that if they do this job well, there'll be more promotions down the line.
you know how everyone likes having their own office, right?
Sure.
Well, that would come after a few years,
if they're prepared to work hard and grow with the university.
Yes, that should attract these people.
Well, that's enough talk about the job.
What about the actual candidates?
How many do we have?
Ah, I've narrowed it down to four...
ah, just using their first names, that's Steven, Abdul, Lek, and Oscar.
As you said, there's quite a bit of experience between them, about 34 years in all.
What's the exact breakdown of figures?
Abdul and Steven both have seven years,
Lek has one more, and Oscar is the most experienced, at 12.
But who's the most qualified?
Steven and Abdul have an MBA
sorry! Abdul's got something called a M.B.P.
some foreign thing which translates as Master of Business Practice.
I'm not sure what that is, but does he do the job well?
Very well, apparently
better than Lek and Oscar, who hold a degree and some certificates, respectively.
But we have to think about any drawbacks,
y'know, possible issues with any of them.
I asked their respective deans for feedback, and I found out that Steven, the younger one, drinks a bit.
So, he has a problem with alcohol?
No, he never drinks to excess,
but at the bar he's often expressed his intention of moving on, of teaching abroad.
Ah, he's not stable.
Not stable at all, apparently.
We'll never know for how long he'll hold the job.
We need stable personnel,
and people without family problems, or sick relatives, like the last guy we promoted.
What about Abdul then? Will he do?
He might do, except his English language ability is limited.
It's functional, but a bit broken, and meaning is sometimes lost.
That's not the problem with the next candidate, Lek, who has good language ability,
but this job involves handling people,
and his dean says Lek's attitude is bad.
In what way?
His manners are okay, and he's interested in his job,
but he believes there should always be adequate leisure in life.
He definitely won't work overtime and complains a lot already about his job,
but this last candidate, Oscar, is probably not the right one, either.
Why not?
Not another problem with language?
His first language isn't English, but he speaks it well enough.
He's stable, with a good attitude, but his age is the problem.
Age is not a problem. That would be ageism, and I don't believe in that.
But with his age comes health problems as well,
and serious one is that.
Oh, that might be an issue then.

1273,IELTS Recent Actual Test 3 - Part 4,C1,ielts-recent-actual-test-3---part-4,77,"If there is one natural feature which has long fascinated man, it is caves
those natural underground spaces into which people can enter.
No known cave in the world can exist without it being extensively explored,
whether it be in remote areas, such as the Clearwater Cave in Borneo,
or immensely long and difficult, such as Mammoth Cave in America,
or perhaps the most challenging: those caves below the water table, full with water,
in which case the exploration is known as cave diving.
Whatever the case, if the caves are known,
as complex and difficult as they usually are, they will be explored.
The formal name for the study of caves is speleology,
and involves many disciplines, such as chemistry,
geology, biology, and cartography,
or the science of making accurate maps,
since the largest caves can be hundreds of kilometers long and highly complicated.
If the exploration is just for fun, the activity is known as caving,
but with the difficulties and dangers involved,
the average caver is often involved with one of these speleological sciences.
As for the number of caves in the world,
research suggests that only a fraction have been found and documented,
mostly in the areas in which caving has long been a popular activity,
such as in America, France, or Australia.
China, for example, has huge areas of limestone bedrock,
prime material for cave formation,
and logically must contain among the largest number of caves in the world,
yet only few are documented due to the lack of interest in caving there.
Thus, as exploration continues, new caves will be discovered,
and it is likely that the numbers could radically change in the future.
With caves being such mysterious and intriguing places,
the obvious question concerns how they form.
The most common cause is the effect of slightly acidic water
in a process called 'dissolution'.
Here, water seeps into the ground, and down through rock masses.
If this rock is soluble, the water dissolves some of it,
and over time, the passage expands to become a cave, or cave system.
The largest and most common of these involves limestone,
although other materials are possible, including gypsum, marble, and even salt.
Now, if the cave is formed at the same time as the rock, it is called a primary cave,
and the most common of these are lava tubes.
When lava from volcanoes flows downhill,
the topmost surface cools and solidifies first,
leaving the hotter lava to continue to flow beneath.
If most of this eventually flows out, a hollow tube is left.
The country Iceland, has some excellent caves of this type,
and even far-flung Australia has a few.
Finally, there are sea caves, formed from waves pounding into coastal cliffs,
and eroding into fault lines, or softer rock.
These caves are usually the shortest, about 50 meters at most,
since the erosive action of the waves can only reach a certain distance.
However, it is limestone caves which will always be the most interesting.
This is due to the presence of limestone formations.
As the groundwater seeps downward through the ceiling of the caves,
it encounters a different pressure and temperature,
causing it to deposit a small amount of its dissolved calcium carbonate.
Over time, through the action of millions of drops,
this deposition process results in ever-growing masses,
known as stalactites (if hanging from the ceiling),
or stalagmites (if growing from the floor).
Alternatively, the water may flow over a large surface of rock, forming flowstone,
and with other sorts of processes,
can result in beautiful milky-white formations of astonishing complexity.
One of the best examples of this,
as well as of what surprising discoveries may yet await,
is the Lechuguilla Cave in New Mexico.
In the 1950s, some cavers heard the sound of wind underneath some large boulders on the cave floor,
a clear sign of a deeper passageway.
It took until 1984 for a group of cavers to gain permission to start digging,
and two years later, in 1986,
they broke through into a walkable passageway,
unlocking one of the longest cave systems in the world,
the deepest in America,
and some of the most beautiful formations ever found.
Unusually, many of these were yellow with sulphur,
suggesting that the caves were a result of hydrogen-sulfide from nearby oil deposits.
This was forced through fracture lines,
combining with existing groundwater to form sulfuric acid,
dissolving the limestone from the bottom up,
instead of the normal top-down seepage which characterises most limestone cave formations.

1274,IELTS Recent Actual Test 4 - Part 1,B1,ielts-recent-actual-test-4---part-1,76,"Hello?
Hello? Who is this?
Hello. I'm a representative of the Tallyho Survey Company,
and I'd like to ask you a few questions regarding exercise.
Ah, that's an interesting subject.
Yes, we think so, too.
But I'm afraid I'm a bit busy at the moment.
Don't worry. This will only take about four minutes at the most.
It's 10:25 now, so it will all be over by 10:30.
Well... alright, if it's that short.
It will be.
So, one of the first things I need to know is where you are,
that is, which suburb or area of the city?
The last client was in Blackburn, for example.
Blackburn. That's close to me. I'm in Box Hill.
Another eastern suburb then.
I have a friend in Box Hill, too. Interesting place.
Now, I need your approximate age for this survey.
Are you younger than 20, between 20 and 29, 30 and 39, and so on?
I'll turn 40 in a few months,
so that puts me in the 40 to 49 age group.
Well, that's in a few months, so right now you're in the 30 to 39.
Oh, right. So put that then.
Okay. Now, I need to know your occupation.
The last caller was a housewife, for example; the one before that a teacher.
I used to be a teacher, too, teaching cookery.
And now?
Now you can just put 'domestic duties'.
Actually, I hope to begin a new job soon, as a cook,
but that won't be for some time yet.
I have to wait for my husband's restaurant to open.
Cook? That sounds interesting,
but it's 'domestic duties' for now.
Okay, that just leaves some information about your family.
This is not obligatory at all, so if you don't want to answer, that's fine.
What sort of information, exactly?
Oh, it's very broad.
Married, with children; single mother, that sort of thing.
The last customer said she was a single mother.
I'm married, and not a mother. Put 'married, no children'.
I'm married with children, myself.
But I'll put in your details, and that finishes the profile,
and just leaves the actual survey itself, if you're ready to proceed.
Alright, let's begin the survey now, about your exercise habits.
I'm afraid I don't exercise much at all.
Well, the main question is in what form you take your exercise, however little that may be,
for example, in just cleaning. Do you clean the house?
My husband does the cleaning, actually,
but I walk to the supermarket and shops very often, up to four times a week.
I'll put that then, unless there's something else.
Nothing else, really. But I diet. I'm very strict about what I eat.
Oh, and I do yoga, although that's not very energetic,
more a form of relaxation, and to tighten my muscles.
They're both important, of course,
but what about sport?
Do you undertake any sporting activities?
This could be very infrequent. In the past, for example.
My husband plays basketball at the local school, and I sometimes watch.
When he was younger he was in a basketball team, but I never participated.
Have you done anything at all?
I used to hike in a nearby national park.
Well that's a definite physical activity, so I'll put that - but not basketball.
Alright, that just leaves future exercise intentions.
Do you plan, or expect to do, at some stage, any form of exercise?
I once dreamt of doing modern dance, but that's never going to happen.
Realistically, I'm thinking about going swimming, at the local aquatic centre,
although my husband thinks we should just jog.
I can't see myself doing that, though, too tiring.
I can understand.
I used to jog, too, and it really makes you sweat.
I'd say swimming's a much better option.
But I'll be starting this job as a cook in my husband's restaurant.
I imagine I'll be very tired doing all those late shifts.
But if I have any energy left over, I might go to the aquatic centre to release some stress.
Alright. Well, that's the end of the survey.
Thank you very much for your time.

1275,IELTS Recent Actual Test 4 - Part 2,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-4---part-2,73,"Welcome to the library, or the I.L.C., which means Independent Learning Centre,
and let me explain about some of its facilities.
We're standing here at the entry gates, next to the borrowing desk.
That's where you check out any books,
but you are also advised to study in the library here,
since most of our material cannot be borrowed.
Thus, we have Seating along the middle of the library,
and in that far corner in front of us. on the left,
we have the Quiet Reading Section, for some serious reading activity.
We used to have the computers there
but then realised that that corner was very quiet,
and thus better suited for the purpose it now has.
The computers were instead shifted to a more central location,
right beside us here, on the left.
Again, somewhat confusingly,
this area once housed the Newspaper and Magazine Section,
but the people in the Quiet Reading Area had to walk too far to collect this literature,
so it was moved to right beside them, in the adjacent corner.
So, feel free to read the newspapers there.
But the reference books, those huge weighty dictionaries, atlases, and encyclopedias,
were all situated at the opposite end of the building, against the wall.
This was because they weren't generally that popular,
and we wanted more space for the magazine racks,
always a favourite with readers.
Okay, as well as reading, you need to work on your listening skills,
and for that you need the Audio Section.
Again, such an activity needs a quiet area,
so we put this in the last remaining corner, up there on your right, as you can see.
There are CD players and headphones, so just borrow the listening packs,
sit down there, and listen away.
Right, that just leaves the main library.
In other libraries, that's often right beside the Newspaper and Magazine Section,
allowing freedom to choose from all genres of literature,
but here, we've got them further apart.
For the main library, just follow your nose,
past the Central Seating there, and it's there among all that shelving,
upon which you'll find an abundance of interesting books and listening packs to use.
Now, I'd like to tell you a bit more about an excellent service offered in the I.L.C. here
that we call the 'Special Sessions'.
What can you do in them?
For a start, many of you need practice in speaking English.
and for that we hold a special Discussion Session, led by a teacher.
That can be noisy, in fact, we hope that it is noisy,
since that would mean many people are talking.
It's in the Central Seating area,
and it used to be from 10:30 to 1:30.
but we found that the noise was disturbing the regular I.L.C patrons,
so we shortened and moved this discussion to the morning,
9 am time slot, when fewer people are in the centre.
It goes for one and a half hours.
Alright, what about Writing Skills?
Well, we can help you there with another teacher.
Now, writing is a fairly quiet activity,
so that teacher stations him or herself in the Quiet Reading area
from 1:30 until 3.
The 10:30-to-midday time slot cannot have a teacher for such writing skills,
as they are all teaching in the morning.
For this reason, of course, there cannot be an on-call teacher in the morning either,
although many people would like one, particularly the 10.30-to-noon crowd,
having just finished their early morning class.
These students all have to wait until midday onwards,
when, for three hours, a teacher will be stationed in the Audio Section,
ready to deal with all those questions.
Until recently, we had another teacher doing the 3-pm-to-6-pm time slot,
in the Central Seating,
but all the noise interfered with the late users of the I.L.C., so we had to cancel that.
Also noisy can be the Language Exchange,
where local students who want to learn your language will help you practise English.
This is generally done in pairs,
so the noise level is low enough not to need this exchange to run at 9 am,
but at the more congenial time of 10:30, among the Central Seating.
That must finish by 1:30 though,
after which quieter and more individual activities take place.

1276,IELTS Recent Actual Test 4 - Part 3,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-4---part-3,79,"Hi, Emily. What did you think of that lecture?
A bit hard to follow, but I have some good lecture-listening note-taking strategies which really help,
so I can review the lecturer's message later.
Lecture-listening note-taking strategies? Review it later?
That sounds interesting.
I must admit, I struggle a bit to take down the gist of what I hear.
Look at my notes.
Well, I can see a basic problem immediately.
You're writing full words, such as 'century' when all you need is a 'C',
And don't write 'increase'; just draw an 'up' arrow.
And why write 'thousand' when a 'th' will do?
I see. Just use symbols. That's not a bad idea at all.
It's the most basic strategy, allowing you to record information at a faster pace.
These lecturers can talk faster than others, too,
so you don't want to waste any time.
But you need to be very familiar with your set of symbols.
Why?
Because you'll have to look at these notes days, weeks, or even months afterwards,
when you begin writing your essay,
so you'll need to be able to interpret them at a later stage.
I think I can do this, even by looking at your notes.
'Immed' must mean immediately.
But regarding the lecture as a whole,
I knew the professor would be giving a set of specific recommendations,
and comparing two alternative approaches, so I formatted my page in advance,
adding the features consistent with the nature of what I was going to hear.
I think I need an example of what you mean.
Well, look at my page.
Before the lecture, I drew large headings saying 'recommendations'.
You should always draw these, and I drew a table saying, 'Approach 1' and 'Approach 2'.
At the end I drew a flowchart,
as obviously the final recommendation would be a step-by-step approach.
Then I was prepared in advance to simply fill in the spaces.
Wow! Now that's clever.
Your advice about note taking sounds great, but I still have one question, Emily.
How are you able to design your page in advance?
I mean, how can you predict the nature of the talk,
and know which design is likely to work best?
It's rather obvious when you think about it.
What's your next lecture about?
Legal Studies.
Well, that suggests to me that you'll need a flowchart,
since the judicial system has a very logical 'do this first, do that second' approach,
which must be followed in that order,
y'know, all the processes that happen in the courtroom,
and the procedures that must take place to ensure complete legality.
Sure. That's the way law is, very linear and orderly,
but what about Culture Studies?
That's just a mass of comparisons of different cultures.
Which tells you that you will need a table, where, in tabular form, you can efficiently write down information.
But often the lecture's not that simple.
The professor throws in a really complex mix of ideas.
Then use a spider graph, like the web a spider makes,
where there's a central idea around which you attach all the associated thoughts, and ideas, and impressions.
I see. I think I understand.
And that would be very quick, too; very efficient.
I like that. But what about Management Theory?
How would you approach that?
The same as with Culture Studies.
I'd use a network, which is basically the same as a spider graph, linking thoughts,
although this time there are directions involved.
It is this element that makes it different,
the fact that the thoughts go one way and not the other.
Okay... has directions.
It sounds logical.
What about the other subjects, such as Political Science?
There's no predictable order to that.
Well, for that I'd just put my notes in a line,
that is, in linear, or straight-line fashion,
and these notes would use symbols, of course, to save time.
Okay, that just leaves Mass Media.
For that, I wouldn't have any special design at all.
As you say, sometimes it's impossible to predict in what way lecturers will present their information,
in which case the best you can do is pre-write headings,
but not specific, just general,
as in Main One, Main Two, Sub One, Two, and Three, and so on.
Okay.
But always be prepared to adapt to the nature of the talk,
using any one of the other methods if it becomes appropriate at the time.

1277,IELTS Recent Actual Test 4 - Part 4,C2,ielts-recent-actual-test-4---part-4,57,"When considering the smallest unit of matter - the atom
most people know of electrons, protons, and neutrons,
but almost none know of another particle,
even though they are constantly emitted from the sun in the trillions,
with 100 to 200 billion of them regularly passing through your body every second.
To repeat, that's not thousands, not millions, but billions, every second.
You don't feel them because they are small,
in fact, so tiny that we can barely detect their presence at all.
These mysterious particles are called neutrinos.
Despite such an abundance, detecting them is a huge undertaking,
and there are many reasons for this.
Firstly, the neutrino itself is so small that you need to eliminate absolutely all other particles around.
To do this, you need what is called a clean room,
one that has an extremely low level of dust, microbes, floating particles, or chemical vapours.
You probably don't know it, but the air around you right now has almost 40 million particles per cubic meter.
In contrast, the cleanest of clean rooms has less than 10.
The second problem is that you also need an environment with absolutely no background radiation.
At the surface of the Earth, such radiation is all around,
from the sun and sky, and from TVs and communication devices.
The only way to screen out all that is to go underground, and I mean deep underground.
For example, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada uses an old nickel mine, one of the deepest in the world,
and puts the Observatory in its lowest tunnel, more than two kilometers below the surface.
At such depths, stray radiation is sufficiently screened out to allow neutrinos only to pass by.
The final problem is that you need an elaborate detection system,
and this apparatus is huge,
and its installation in this deep underground cavity presents quite a headache.
Holding such a weighty construction safe and secure requires complex engineering work,
such as rock-bolting and support structuring.
This obviously requires great care, and takes a lot of effort.
So, I've told you about the difficulty in detecting neutrinos.
They are tiny, virtually weightless, have no electric charge,
and hardly interact with anything at all.
Yet we can detect them, and to see how, let's consider the Sudbury installation once again.
The detector there consists of a spherical container filled with heavy water.
This rests inside another vessel filled with normal water,
which helps support the weight of the inner sphere,
as well as providing further shielding from any stray radiation.
At the edge of this inner sphere are about 10,000 electronic detectors.
These are extremely sensitive, able to multiply a hundred million times any electric current which occurs.
So, as the neutrinos pass through this sphere of water,
there is a very very very small chance that one of them may hit a water molecule.
To increase the likelihood of this, two strategies are used.
One. the larger the sphere of water, the better,
and the Sudbury tank holds not 10 tons, not 100 tons, but 1000 tons.
Two, the water is special, consisting as it does of heavier molecules.
So, what happens is this.
If the neutrino hits the water molecule, the neutrino is absorbed,
but the molecule itself splits apart, producing a tiny electric current.
It is this which is detected, and analysed, giving key information about the neutrino.
The final question is why do we care about these elusive particles?
Well, just think,
they can pass right through the core of our sun at the speed of light without being affected or losing strength.
No other form of radiation can do that,
meaning that the knowledge we get about neutrinos can help us to control them.
With this ability, we can probe the centre of our Earth,

1278,IELTS Recent Actual Test 5 - Part 1,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-5---part-1,75,"Okay, Ella. As you know, the deadline for this project is the end of the month, so we'd better plan it well.
Yes, I've already been thinking along those lines,
and I've decided we should divide this project into three phases:
the Pre-phase, then Phase 1, and then Phase 2,
with strict deadlines involved for each one.
Given that we have to finish this quickly, that sounds good. Tell me more.
The Pre-phase is the simplest.
We just need to allocate a space or a place to do our planning,
and this space will need to be quite big.
Sure, and we have to decide on the equipment needed as well.
Remember the last project, when we didn't have enough projectors to present our ideas?
We lost lots of time there.
Yes, that was a bad start.
That's why, after the Pre-phase is finished, I've allocated a mere three days for Phase One.
That will involve drawing the plans.
We'll need Jenna to help us.
And Marco.
Yes, but not Susan.
Susan is just far too busy to participate, as much as I'd like her in the team.
Let's just take Fred instead. He'll do.
Sure. Fred's not as experienced as Greg, but I agree, he'll do fine for this job.
Then it's straight into Phase 2, collecting, collating, analysing, and preparing the final report.
Can we do that in five days?
I think that's optimistic, which is why I scheduled six.
That's almost a week! Do we have that much time?
We do, and with the right people, six days should see the job done.
Who are the people for this phase? Arthur and Rob, right?
No, Arthur's got other things to do, and Rob's on leave,
so Mike alone will be the main man on this part.
He's done it before, so it should be fine.
But he may need some help with the smaller tasks.
Someone who is good with detail and procedures.
Hmmm. Peter's not free at the moment, so I can arrange Leo to chip in some time and advice.
Leo's very useful, particularly under pressure.
And that's everything sorted!
Well done Ella. This report should certainly be ready in time.
Okay, Ella, you've done a good job with the basic time frame of this project, but what about specifics?
What sort of specifics?
Well, things like information gathering.
Are we going to use questionnaires like we did last time?
I was thinking of using the Internet to ask people to give their views,
but you often get such silly responses when you do that.
I'm of the view that the best way to find out things is to ask people directly,
so that's what we'll do.
Okay, but that will take longer.
We'll probably even have to do some of the work at home.
No, I don't think so, as long as we stay back at work for some after-hours meetings.
Well, that's better than coming in early.
No one functions well in the morning.
Also, the final report will need at least two appendices.
Not only that, we'll have to attach a small booklet to the end,
containing printouts of the relevant parts from all the foreign websites we accessed.
That will take even more time.
Are you sure we can meet this deadline?
Yep, I've worked it all out, and I'm confident we can do it.
Phase 1 should be finished by the 5th,
leaving Phase 2 to begin about the 8th or 9th.
Now, there's a public holiday on the 10th,
Meaning that everything should be able to be submitted on the 15th,
and after that, we can relax,
and celebrate on the 25th when the Design Division gives us approval to go ahead.
Hah, you're assuming that the Design Division will approve this, and that's not guaranteed at all.
Oh come on Marcus, be positive.
You know this should be approved,
in fact, I'm even planning the celebration when this is all over.
Oh yeah, what's on the agenda, then?
Well, we definitely don't want a party in the office, do we?
We'll want to get away from this place,
and we're all too busy with our own lives and families to find a mutual time free for a dinner party,
so I thought we'd just buy some nice expensive gifts for everyone who participated.
We can just give these to the people here in the office.
That sounds fine to me, but make sure they're not too expensive.
The Budget Department will never approve the cost.
Don't worry; I know how much I can get away with.
Alright. I'll leave that with you.

1279,IELTS Recent Actual Test 5 - Part 2,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-5---part-2,66,"Hello there.
I was asked to tell you about the extent of the damage to the main building, caused by the recent storm.
Oh, that's right. I take it that most of the damage is just to the main building?
It is indeed, since the building is so old.
However, luckily, the damage is minor,
and all of it can be fixed in one day, given that we have five people in our team.
What will you be doing first? I understand you start at 8 in the morning.
That's right,
and we were going to remove the fallen tree,
but we've been told there are exams that morning,
and I'm sure the sound of those saws and other heavy equipment will disturb all the students,
so instead we'll fix that leaky roof.
That's a 4-hou job, since it involves substantial repair,
not like fixing broken windows, which can be done quite quickly.
So you'll fix the broken window after that, from midday?
We could do that,
but since we'll be working in the ceiling, it's more logical to get rid of those birds' nests there.
It's a small job but will require crawling inside the ceiling cavity,
which is not an easy exercise, so that will take about an hour.
But this is good, since by that time the exams should be over,
and we can address that tree which has been blown over,
after our 1-hour lunch break of course.
It will be quite noisy dealing with that, but it will be finished by three o'clock.
Some of our staff will then leave to fix things on another site,
an office nearby needs a new window,
but two of us, including myself, will remain here to paint over that discoloured patch of wall in your office.
Oh good, it looks so horrible at the moment.
Well, we'll certainly make it look good once again,
and in the last hour of our working day, we'll fix up that problem with the wiring.
Apparently the power doesn't go to one of the classrooms.
Probably some water has gotten into the fuse box,
so we'll just change a few wires, and clean up the moisture, and it should be fine.
I certainly appreciate all the effort you and your team are taking to fix things here,
but I do have one request.
And what is that?
You said you're going to paint the back wall in my office.
Will it be the same colour as before?
Yes, we'll make it a nice white colour.
Well that's the point. I'd prefer it to be yellow, to match the furniture.
The furniture is orange, actually, but I think yellow is a nice match.
Can you do that?
We can certainly do that. Yellow it is.
Certainly a prettier colour than just plain white,
or the blue in my kitchen at home for that matter.
And we can leave the paint can with you, in case you need to do some touch-ups,
or if the stain reappears.
I'll just leave it in the garden shed, the one next to the main classroom.
And incidentally, about those birds in the ceiling.
I was just investigating, and I heard the chirping of little baby birds in there,
so there must be some young ones in a nest.
I just thought you'd like to know that we can give them to a wildlife reserve.
There's one in the next suburb, so that should not be too much trouble.
Or you could give them to one of our teachers.
I have a colleague who can raise them.
I would say the wildlife reserve is a better option,
since the people there are used to dealing with animals,
and as for that fallen tree, we'll cut it up into small pieces
and that can be firewood in my house, so that won't be wasted either,
although the smoke will cause some pollution,
but I have a special licence for my fireplace, so no one can object to that.
I've noticed also that the university has a garden bin, for the smaller items,
leaves and sticks and bark, and so on,
so we can dispose of material in that, also.
You do have some waste piles out the back,
but a proper garden bin means that the material will be recycled,
and that's better for the environment, so you can rest assured we will use that.

1280,IELTS Recent Actual Test 5 - Part 3,C1,ielts-recent-actual-test-5---part-3,67,"Well gentlemen, we've almost finished our second semester at this university.
What do you think of all the courses we attend?
On the whole, I'd say they're quite good,
apart from Social History, which I find to be a little too inexact.
Yes, the lecturer's style is also very very dull.
I certainly agree with you there,
although I would say that the textbook is more interesting. 'Welfare State'.
The subtitle says, 'An examination of social development in the 20th century.'
Yes, 'Welfare State' is a good book, but look how many pages it has.
458!
I agree. It's just too long to be easily read.
Far too long, although it's certainly well written in parts.
Yes, and if you compare it to the textbook for Cultural Studies, what's it called?
'Inner Views', I think.
No, that's the book for Media Studies, and we finished that subject last semester.
The book you're thinking of is 'In Perspective'.
Sorry, you're right. 'In Perspective'.
And the subtitle says, 'A comparison of social groups.'
Somewhat interesting, wouldn't you say?
Well, mildly so, as is the subject,
dealing as it does with such a wide variety of issues,
but the book itself certainly oversimplifies a very complex subject.
I agree. I also got annoyed at its constant oversimplification.
Life is more complicated than what it suggests.
Yes, but what you call 'oversimplifying' may well be considered 'clarifying'.
Look at this other textbook, 'Government in Action'.
Some may say that it also oversimplifies,
but it must do so in order to present a coherent picture of an equally complex subject.
'Government in Action'? Which subject...?
It's the textbook for 'Political Theory'.
Oh, I hate politics.
That's why I don't like the 'Active Leadership' subject, either.
And most of the stuff in that 'Political Theory' textbook is based on the American system.
You see, it's written by Americans, so it's not even relevant to us here.
I'd agree with you there,
it's not relevant to us at all, since our government uses the Westminster system.
Yes, I suppose that is a problem.
Well, it seems we all have certain criticisms about the textbooks we're using,
but at the same time, we all like some elements, at least, of the subjects we're studying.
What's your favourite subject, David?
I'm not sure. I like Political Theory, but...
Cultural Studies is by far the best, even better than Political Theory,
which I also like, but just not as much.
Why do you say that, Steve?
I was thinking, perhaps, Social History is worth considering as best.
Social History is good, but I made my choice because the subject is relevant to this modern society.
But so is Social History, and I like the historical element,
which the other subjects lack.
Even Political Theory examines history only briefly, and in a very narrow way,
so I'd say Social History is the most rewarding for me.
What about you, Susan?
I think Social History is certainly very good,
but Political Theory is, in fact, the best,
since basically, every human system boils down to politics.
So, despite a certain irrelevancy in the details,
the basic message remains as relevant as ever.
Oh Susan, you can't be serious.
Let's ask Olive, again.
She's over there.
Olive! Which subject do you think is the best?
Ah, a difficult question.
I'm very interested in culture,
so Cultural Studies is certainly my cup of tea,
but I'm politically active also, and hope to pursue this as a career,
so Political Theory would be the one I'd pick.
I don't believe it. Even with that irrelevant textbook?
Don't listen to him, Olive; you have a right to your own opinion.

1281,IELTS Recent Actual Test 5 - Part 4,C1,ielts-recent-actual-test-5---part-4,61,"If you consider the farms of old - the type your father or grandfather grew up on,
they were small and labour-intensive, requiring lots of workers.
In addition, they often had a diversity of products,
be that animal or vegetable - say, cows and sheep,
or oranges and lemons, with some peaches,
and a few chickens on the side, for the production of eggs.
The many workers involved raised their families, who needed products and support services,
such as medical clinics and schools,
so the small country towns had mercantile activity,
store fronts, and community participation, with all ages present and a distinct town culture.
And how it has changed!
Travel to any small country town in virtually any developed country,
and you will often see that these places are now somewhat forlorn and deserted,
lacking life and vigour.
Many of the residents have long since moved towards the big cities,
so the country areas have become depopulated, and their downtowns empty.
This phenomenon is so predictable and widespread that it even has a name,
rural flight, or rural exodus,
and it has produced some fairly predictable problems.
As for the causes of rural exodus, the most obvious is the industrialisation of agriculture.
This comes in two aspects,
one of them being monocultural farming practices.
What this means is that it is now more efficient to have one product, and focus on its needs almost exclusively.
So, for example, animal husbandry will usually involve a single type of animal, say pigs,
but with huge factory farming techniques,
or, in other words, the second aspect: economies of scale.
This means instead of 200 pigs, there'll be 2000,
tightly fitted into small pens or cages,
with high density waste disposal and automatic feeding systems.
Yet despite this huge size, it can all be controlled by just a dozen farm workers pushing the right button.
You might not like it, but in a competitive market,
the cheaper the overheads, the better, and one can't argue with market economics.
It's simply the way of the modern world,
and it has changed the face of rural districts, mostly for the worst.
We can talk at length about the problem of rural exodus, but what about solutions?
Well, there is certainly some cause for hope,
since many are now feeling the negatives of increasing urbanisation,
negatives which the countryside generally does not have.
Thus, tourism, for example, is certainly one avenue of revenue and revitalisation.
The most important consideration here is that the local residents themselves participate in developing such initiatives,
and deciding what happens, since outsiders, be they state government or city-based planners,
do not fully understand the local settings,
the possibilities which may be on offer, or the town culture,
since even small rural areas can be highly distinctive from neighbouring ones.
For example, the Daylesford area has developed a tourist industry based on the natural springs there,
putting forward the angle that this water is relaxing and revitalising for the health.
There has been the development of spas, saunas, and small-scale accommodation within its picturesque hillsides.
And another solution is to utilise the predominant local product.
This takes advantage of the fact that many city-people are developing a dislike for factory-produce and packaged foodstuffs.
They are becoming interested in products that can be sold directly to them, at a cheaper price,
while preserving all the freshness from the tree or animal.
It is important here that the country area is not only characterised by a specific product,
but markets this idea well.
For example, many areas of country Victoria have developed widespread grape-growing and winemaking facilities,
and encourage wine tasting tourism -
now a thriving industry, with an international patronage.
Similarly, Harcourt is famous for apples,
Shepparton for mature cheeses,
and Mildura for its citrus products.
Such strategies, done well, give hope that rural areas can revitalise somewhat,
and once again be lively and interesting places to live in.

1282,IELTS Recent Actual Test 6 - Part 1,B1,ielts-recent-actual-test-6---part-1,68,"Hi, Richard. I'm glad I caught you here.
Can I just talk to you about something?
Our new flatmate - Anders - is not quite what I had hoped
I was wondering if you shared my concerns about some of his behaviour.
Ah, yes, Tom, I know what you mean, but we can't be entirely negative.
He has good points. I mean, at least he's quiet.
He doesn't play loud music all night, or bother others, or turn his TV up, disturbing everyone.
Sure, he's quiet, but remember our last flatmate?
He'd say 'hi' to you, and smile, and treat everyone politely.
In comparison, this new guy is very impolite.
He just grunts in reply, and sometimes ignores me altogether.
I guess that's just his way, y'know, just his character.
I don't think he realises he's being impolite, and it shouldn't matter to us too much.
We can just ignore him, too, and quietly live our own lives.
But his friends are hard to ignore, when they visit.
I know what you mean, but how often does that happen?
I rarely see them, maybe once or twice a month.
If they came more often, it might be a problem,
but as it is, such rare visits don't matter so much.
Wouldn't you say so?
Well, I'm not sure, since it's very obvious when they're here because of all the cigarette smoke in the house.
It stinks up the place, and you know we don't allow smoking on the premises.
Well, I've never seen them doing this.
Maybe they do it outside.
Perhaps we can talk to Anders about it.
Always remember, though, in one respect, he's a good tenant.
And it's the most important aspect.
The previous flatmate would always pay the rent late.
I know what you're going to say. This guy pays promptly.
But there's more to being a good tenant than prompt payment.
I mean, you need to turn off the TV, clean up your dishes, dress respectably, be polite, and so on.
I guess what I'm saying is that, basically, you need to co-operate with the others,
and this new guy fails significantly in this respect.
Okay, I suppose you have a point there.
I tell you what, Tom, why don't we talk to our new flatmate, Anders, about these issues?
If we throw him out, we'll have to go to all the trouble of finding another flatmate,
who might not necessarily be much better.
So, let's give the current guy a chance.
Here. I've got a piece of paper, so let's make a short list of issues to discuss with him.
Get it out into the open.
Sure. We'll give him one more chance.
So, write, 'Communication', and let's tell him to...
Well, we can't change a person's personality overnight,
so why don't we have a weekly tenants' meeting, and we can just ask him to attend?
That way we can get to know him better.
I'll write 'attend meeting', and we can take it from there.
Okay, but we have to tell him about his friends.
They can't just do whatever they want.
Write a heading 'friends' and then write 'don't smoke, anywhere, inside or outside'.
Well, instead of being so direct, and possibly causing offense,
I'll just write, 'follow rules',
and verbally mention the rules:
TV off by 10 pm, no loud music, or bad behaviour, including smoking.
Okay, do that, but I still think we need to specifically mention that last issue.
You know how I can't stand the habit,
so I'd like this to be another and separate point. Cigarettes! Strictly forbidden!
And it's important to include the 'strictly' here.
We can't pussyfoot around too much.
Sometimes directness is necessary.
Okay, I'll write that... 'forbidden'...
Okay. And what about cleaning duties?
Anders is a little too relaxed about that.
Dishes are sometimes not washed, dirty tea cups are left around the place, and so on.
So, write 'must do better!'
Yeah, again Tom, he might take that personally, and it could cause a scene.
I'd rather be general. I'll write 'must be done'
and I'll tell him that that's for everyone, not just him. Okay?
Okay. As long as he gets the message.

1283,IELTS Recent Actual Test 6 - Part 2,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-6---part-2,56,"Hello, everyone. Now, you know why I'm here.
You all work in a factory, and in this environment,
there always remains a significant possibility of accidents happening,
in which case, first aid will be necessary.
What is first aid?
It is the provision of emergency on-site care when an injury occurs,
and it is essential for everyone to know, if only simply, the steps which must be followed.
There are, of course, minor injuries which may happen,
not needing further medical care beyond the intervention of the first-aider,
but you can never be sure, thus the following steps must always be followed.
These can be abbreviated to the words ""Dr ABC"",
in other words. D-R-A-B-C.
The 'D' stands for ""danger"", and that's the first issue to keep in mind.
When an accident happens, immediately ascertain that the environment is safe -
that, for example, nothing else will fall or break or cause accidents.
If you, the first-aider, are also injured, the problem is even worse.
The 'R' stands for 'respond'.
You must then ascertain the best response.
Once all the danger has been eliminated, and the distress calls sent out,
the appropriate action is, obviously, to help the injured party.
Alright, that leads to 'A', which stands for ""airway"".
In order to stay alive, all people need to have an open airway to allow breathing.
A conscious person will automatically clear their own airway,
but if unconscious, this may not happen.
The brain is stopped or hindered from properly directing the body
and, obviously, in the worst case, death can result,
for this reason, the injured person is normally put into the 'recovery' position -
placed on the side, tilting the head back, and ensuring that there are no blockages in the mouth.
To free any such blockages, the back can be slapped,
or the chest compressed, allowing anything to be spat out.
Now that the airway is free, check for 'B' or 'breathing'.
If breathing is not happening, or is irregular,
the first-aider may have to assist with what is technically known as cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
or more commonly, CPR.
This involves breathing for the patient, through mouth-to-mouth contact,
while periodically massaging the heart through compressions to the chest.
This combination allows blood, and oxygen, to flow around the body, keeping the patient alive,
hopefully until medics, such as doctors, advanced first-aiders, or ambulance staff, arrive.
Now, it's certainly good to have knowledge of emergency first aid
but. obviously, the best situation is simply not to have accidents occur in the first place,
for that, you need to be aware of safety issues,
but just saying ""be aware"" does not usually achieve much.
It is more important to have an appointed person whose job is to ensure awareness and work-safety.
Safety inspections would obviously be part of their job,
whereby they can make sure, for example, that the first-aid boxes are fully equipped.
Another idea is to put posters on the walls,
but, interestingly, research has proven that these tend to be ignored,
becoming just part of the wallpaper - seen, but not put into practice.
It is much better if everyone is just instilled to not be reckless,
that is, to not rush into situations without thinking about the possibility of accidents,
and instilling this mindset is part of the job of the safety officer.
Some other suggestions are ongoing first-aid training,
and ""no accident"" reward or star systems.
These have had some success, but nothing beats a regular meeting, say, once a month,
in which the subject of safety is brought to the attention of everyone,
and any outstanding issues related to this are thoroughly discussed.

1284,IELTS Recent Actual Test 6 - Part 3,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-6---part-3,79,"Hi, Nicole.
As you know, we've got to decide on the best ways this university can reduce its waste.
You inspected the eastern campus, and I did the western buildings.
Did you do all the interviews as well?
Yes, I interviewed all the staff, who made some good observations,
and I interviewed some of the students.
The students said little that was interesting.
They don't seem to care that much.
It was the cleaners, surprisingly, who revealed the most relevant facts.
That's not surprising to me.
They empty all the bins, so they see the waste first-hand,
whereas the staff just throw things away without thinking.
What item was most commonly disposed of?
Well, it really depended on where I interviewed.
In the cafeteria precinct,
obviously paper plates and cups were thrown away all over the place.
There was almost no attempt at recycling.
However, across the university in general,
it was paper copying that filled up most bins,
far more than plastic, or other forms of waste.
Do people care about this, then?
Well, some do, if you can believe them.
I must have interviewed about 30% of customers in the cafeteria,
and the results were mixed.
Out of all the people I interviewed, well over half,
maybe about 55% of them, were quite honest about it,
telling me that they had little concern.
The other fraction, 45%, were more troubled.
Yes, but do they do anything about it?
Surprisingly, quite a significant percentage do do something,
even if they aren't particularly concerned.
I mean, small things.
About 10% bring their own cups to the cafeteria, for example,
and at least 1/3 said they use recycling bins,
so, in total, it's an equal split between those who do something, or those who don't.
So why do so many people remain inactive,
particularly over an issue they should care about more?
I think they do care, and many of them are prepared to do something.
Obviously, there's an element of laziness,
but I'd say that it's relatively small.
If they knew what to do, and if stringent systems existed,
or if the importance of this was made clearer to them,
I'm sure you'd see a much larger percentage of people actively working towards helping our environment.
Well, there's cause for optimism, at least.
Clearly then, there's a significant waste of paper here at this university,
so I've worked out one practical suggestion which could help reduce it -
specifically, the waste from the excess photocopying.
Let me hear it, then.
Ah obviously, for a start,
we've got to ensure that people, including the staff,
without exception, copy both sides of a page.
We can't tolerate single-sided copying. It's just far too wasteful.
Absolutely. Just more trees being chopped down.
But as people are doing copying,
there may be adjustments, and practice copying,
producing single-sided copies or blank pages not wanted and not intended for use.
These need to be deposited into a tray for intended recycling -
you know, for recopying onto the blank side of the page.
But people don't usually do that.
I'm afraid it's just human nature.
No matter how unimportant the copying is, they prefer to use fresh paper.
Yeah, I agree with you,
which is why you need to display these papers right in front of everyone,
with a clear sign, 'Please Reuse', to make it easy for them to do so.
They still won't do it.
I know. That's why you take some of these papers, and regularly stack them inside the copier,
in a special tray, once a day, say, in the morning.
Well, that's getting better, making it easier for them to use the paper,
but still, I'm afraid many won't.
That's why you allow everyone to select this tray when copying.
You distribute numbers or codes to every person,
giving them special access to this recycling tray.
Every time they use papers from this, it's tallied up to their account.
I know I'm sounding a bit negative, or even cynical here...
but why should they bother using that tray?
Because the person who does the most copying from this recycling tray gets, say, a cinema pass,
or lottery ticket, or some other sort of reward.
Ah, right! Now that's a system which might just work.
Let's trial it in the office and see what happens.

1285,IELTS Recent Actual Test 6 - Part 4,C1,ielts-recent-actual-test-6---part-4,68,"We all know about the role of carbon dioxide in causing global warming.
Obviously, society needs to reduce the release of carbon dioxide, otherwise known as CO2.
This gas comes from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil,
and it is virtually impossible for society to prevent, or even limit such activity.
Our need for energy and power is just too great.
Instead, a more practical idea is to collect the carbon dioxide from the burning process,
for example, directly from the chimneys of power stations,
and somehow prevent this gas from being released into the environment.
To do that, you need to store it somehow, and that has to be essentially forever.
It is perhaps for this reason that many believe that,
rather than storing the carbon dioxide as a gas,
it is better to react it with metal oxides, such as magnesium or calcium,
which results in the formation of a hard carbonate material.
The gas is, in effect, turned into a stable and unreactive solid,
which can simply be dumped anywhere.
This process actually occurs naturally, although very very slowly,
and is one cause of the surface limestone in the world.
But this slow reaction speed is the problem.
Even when enhancing this process through high temperature and pressure,
or pre-treatment of the mineral, it is still far too slow to be economical.
One other technique which has been suggested is to pump the gas to the bottom of the ocean,
where it would react with compounds in the seawater, forming carbonic acid.
However, this alternative has now been ruled out.
The CO2 may be removed from the atmosphere,
but the high oceanic acidity which would result raises its own set of problems,
mostly with all the delicate life and the intricate food chains in the seawater,
some on which we ourselves depend,
and that's something which no one wants to experiment with.
Perhaps because of the lack of alternatives,
the most commonly discussed solution to the problem of disposing of carbon dioxide is to pump the gas underground -
a technique known as 'geosequestration'.
In this system, the CO2, for example,
could be pumped into underground pockets within depleted oil wells, or disused coal tunnels.
This carries, however, three serious disadvantages,
namely: the risk of leaks, the considerable costs involved,
and finally, the unproven effectiveness.
Let us look at those three disadvantages in detail.
Firstly, there is the risk of leaks.
Although the gas would be deep and sealed over by masses of rock and earth,
the huge pressures in these spaces would turn the gas into a liquid state
capable of moving through rock fissures or faults.
This could allow the gas to eventually be released to the surface.
Since CO2 is heavier than air,
and thus pushes oxygen aside,
such leaks could result in the suffocation of thousands, or tens of thousands of people -
certainly not a consequence to be taken lightly.
Natural CO2 leakage from volcanic build-up has already witnessed such deadly events.
The other problem of geosequestration is the cost.
The time and effort spent on materials and construction,
primarily the pipework through which the gas would travel, does not come cheaply.
So, if this system were to be implemented in, say, coal-fired power plants,
the extra cost would have to be paid by the electricity user,
whose bills would almost double as a consequence.
Few people are prepared to pay this much simply to make a small dent on the effects of global warming.
And this leads to the final problem.
The most basic question is whether geosequestration actually reduces global warming.
The problem here is that the energy needed to create
and drive the sequestration process would require approximately
a quarter of a coal-fired electricity plant's output.
In other words, the plant would have to burn one quarter more of its coal
just to account for the sequestration of the carbon dioxide,
and with coal producing other noxious pollutants,
such as sulphur, ash, and heavy metals,
the environment is hardly benefited at all.
Nevertheless, there are many active experimental efforts underway,
primarily in oil production sites.
These are small but intensively monitored and analysed.
All we can say now is that the jury is still out on whether underground carbon storage will one day be feasible.

1286,IELTS Recent Actual Test 7 - Part 1,B1,ielts-recent-actual-test-7---part-1,75,"Hello?
Hi, good morning, this is Talia from Parrot Bay Travel Agency.
Is Robert Goddard there?
Yes, speaking.
I'm so sorry that I made such an early phone call,
and I'm calling to ask a few questions about your most recent vacation.
Could I have five minutes of your time?
Sure thing.
Great, thanks.
Now, I see here that you visited Melbourne.
Was this your first visit to Melbourne?
No, I have actually been there twice before.
I see.
Now, what would you say was your favorite part about Melbourne?
Well, I did like seeing the exotic wildlife,
and there are great sites to see,
but I have to say I was most impressed by the amazing weather.
Yeah, the weather there is amazing.
Which of the sites listed as part of our official tour did you see,
and of those, which was your favorite?
First I saw the theatre, which was beautifully designed.
It was not nearly as cool as the Town Hall though -
the building is a huge part of Melbourne's history.
Definitely my favourite.
I saw the aquarium too, but wasn't too impressed.
I see.
Yes, people often have great reviews of Town Hall.
Now I would like to ask you about your dining experience.
Did you enjoy the food there?
Absolutely, I loved it!
I'm glad to hear it.
Could you tell me a little bit about what you most enjoyed about the food?
Being such an international city, I loved the variety -
I could find any type of food I wanted.
Whether I wanted seafood, burgers, or anything else, you name it and they had it.
Did you drive to Melbourne?
No, I flew.
I thought about going by train,
but in the interest of time I decided to go by plane.
Right, I see.
And would you mind telling me whether you are under 20,
between the ages of 20 and 40, or older than 40?
Er, it would be nice if I were still under 20.
My vacation probably would have been quite different.
Actually though, I just turned 41 last week.
Oh, happy birthday!
So did you treat yourself and fly first class?
Ha! No way.
I would love to have a budget that high.
I'm more in the mid-range income level.
I wasn't always though - I spent much of my life in a low-income household.
I see.
That answers my next question then, of income level.
And what was the purpose of this visit?
I had to go there on business a lot before and decided I would go there for tourism this time.
I see.
And what is your occupation?
I am mainly a computer programmer.
I also write for a travel magazine on the side,
which is why I visited Melbourne before,
but it's not my main source of income.
I see.
Wow, it sounds like you work a lot!
Yes, I am very busy,
which is exactly why I took a nice week-long vacation to Melbourne.
I completely agree.
Would you care to comment on your accommodation?
My hotel was a good value.
Staying in the city can get really expensive,
so it was nice to find such a good price for the location and quality.
I'm glad I didn't end up in some cheap motel in the middle of nowhere.
I'm glad you didn't either.
Well, thank you for taking part in our survey,
and I'm glad you enjoyed your vacation!
No problem. Take care!

1287,IELTS Recent Actual Test 7 - Part 2,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-7---part-2,56,"Thank you all for coming to our community meeting.
As you know, we are excited to unveil our improvement plan as we look forward to the influx of tourists in the summer months.
I'll start with a quick overview of the main points of interest in the area
for anyone who may not quite know his or her way around yet,
and then I'll get into the improvements made.
First off is my favorite, the Science Museum,
which is on the corner of Saint George Road.
If you have not visited it yet, I encourage you to go before the busy season.
It is absolutely spectacular -
there is even a flight simulator you can try out!
Just west of the Science Museum is the National History Museum.
It's a site not to be missed as well,
with each floor devoted to a different era in our nation's history.
There are special exhibits for children with interactive games and fun history lessons, too.
If you're looking for parking, it is available on the intersection of Queen Street and South King Street in the Car Park.
Standard hourly and daily rates do apply.
The best place for souvenirs is the Shopping Mall,
though it gets extremely busy during peak times.
You can get there from the tube, or the entrance on Timber Road,
just south of Cornwell Road.
This area has students everywhere,
usually from the Primary School across the street from the Shopping Mall.
Classes often take field trips and engage in guided tours through the area.
So that's the overview of the main sites
and hopefully by now I've given you a general idea of the area.
Now I'm going to outline the improvements we have made in our efforts to make the experience even better
for each and every one of our visitors.
You probably noticed when you first drove into the Car Park this morning,
that there is now additional signage to help avoid confusion.
The directions were not entirely clear at first,
so we have increased the number of one-way signs indicating the correct direction of traffic flow.
Not far from there, in line with our mission of giving back to the community,
we constructed a brand new playground for the Primary School.
It is really something to be excited for -
the equipment is state-of-the-art and includes swings, a small climbing wall, and even an obstacle course.
Now we'll head north and take a look at the Science Museum.
In response to our feedback from past visitors to the museum,
there is now free information available outlining not only upcoming IMAX showings,
but also natural wonders like meteor showers, eclipses, and other cool natural events.
The Science Museum isn't the only Museum improving the experience of its visitors.
The National History Museum has added an entire new wing to its facility
to accommodate the large crowds of people gathering to see the Civil War exhibit,
inventions timeline exhibit, and other wonderful sections of the museum.
The increase in space will definitely give a more calm, comfortable experience for visitors.
And finally, remember when there was actually a line at the mall entrance from the Tube Station?
It was terrible trying to get anywhere from the Tube
because foot traffic got so backed up sometimes.
We have addressed that by adding another entry point into the mall from the other end of the platform to disperse the crowd.
So those are the major improvements we have made.
Clearly having too many people that want to visit and enjoy what our community has to offer the public is a good problem to have,
and I am confident that we have made the changes necessary to accommodate the growing interest in the area.
As always, we welcome any questions, comments, or concerns about the new improvement plan.
In a few minutes I will open up the floor for questions
but you can also contact me or any other board member by email or through the city website.
Thank you for coming,
and I now encourage you to stay for the Questions and Answers panel occurring between now and‚Ä¶

1288,IELTS Recent Actual Test 7 - Part 3,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-7---part-3,70,"So you were both given your project assignments for your senior thesis today, right?
Yes, and we already have to submit our topics next week!
But how could they give us a grade this soon?
No, next week's due date will not be counted towards your final grade.
The teachers are just going to read your topic and give you feedback.
Oh, I see.
So first we should come up with our topics, and then what?
Well, once you know what you want to study,
you need to think about how you'll study it.
You need to decide on your research methods.
The methods will be the main part of your paper.
What about the results section?
Well, I can give you feedback on that,
but you will be the one carrying out an experiment
and thus will have to produce the results on your own.
What I would like to do today is practice writing research papers before you even begin your report.
I'll give you samples of old data from past experience.
And you can practice writing results and drawing conclusions.
I think that would be really helpful.
Yeah, it sounds like a lot of extra work,
but I'm sure it would make our actual project easier.
You're exactly right!
So let's get started.
First, let's try this simple experiment on fruit flies.
Read the information, and then take 25 minutes to summarise a results and conclusion section.
That's really important - pay attention to the time limit.
OK, does it still have to be 6,000 words?
No, don't worry about that.
What if we get off topic?
I wouldn't worry too much -
you will have so much information to write about
that it should be easy to stay on topic.
But what about other sources?
Well for this assignment, you can use the one from your textbook.
In your actual paper, you should find old experiments that support your topic.
So do we need to find different types of sources?
For instance, should I be conducting lots of interviews to use in my paper?
No, there's no need to conduct lots of interviews or anything like that.
OK, I'm ready to get started.
I'm still a little confused though, on how we should format our paper.
Don't worry about it for now,
but on your final paper, make sure to pay attention to the format.
It should follow the guidelines exactly.
Oh man, I'm starting to understand why they give us all semester to do this.
Are there any other small details like that that we should know about?
Not a whole lot,
make sure you provide two copies - one for your teacher of course,
but one for yourself as well.
And of course, you know the due date, right?
Uh, it's April the 11th, right?
What? No!
It's May 11th. Right?
Yes.
The due date is May 11.
Write it down!
Oh wow. Yeah, I need to note it.
Also, I'm having trouble finding information on my topic.
What if I can't find enough good sources?
It's alright to change your topic.
Just make sure to do it before the beginning of April.
Oh really?
Wow, I'm definitely going to change it then.
Just make sure to write a note to your teacher letting him or her know.
Okay. So getting back to writing this sample paper, where do we start?
Should I just explain the experiment and what happened?
Well, you need to start with your hypothesis -
what you think will happen -
and then describe your procedure.
Then you can write up the results and your conclusions.
Oh boy, I don't know if I can handle any more instructions‚Ä¶

1289,IELTS Recent Actual Test 7 - Part 4,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-7---part-4,83,"Hello class, and welcome back to Marketing Strategies.
This week I will expand upon last week's lecture by talking about factors you should consider
when creating advertising materials and the effects they can have on your product sales.
Lesson one: limit your advertising to the geographic area of your target market.
Though you may have a product that people want in a large area,
the distance that customers are willing to travel is a significant factor in their choice of where to purchase that product.
Take this example:
if you are really hungry and decide you want a burrito,
would you choose the restaurant that is a block from your apartment,
or the one that is just as good - or even slightly better - across town?
Of course you'll pick the closer restaurant.
Next, there's the method of communication to your target market.
How do you decide among radio ads, TV commercials, fliers,
or even word of mouth?
While we often think of the visual presentation of ads,
there is much more to advertising than the look.
Studies show that consumers are much more likely to remember advertising slogans
if there is also a sound played.
Did you know that your sense of smell is closely linked with memory?
Think about Mandy's Candy Store up the road.
Every time you walk past it, you can just smell the chocolate, right?
I bet you can almost smell it now.
Just mentioning the name brings about the smell memory,
and in turn a chocolate craving.
What better way to sell chocolate bars?
Obviously sometimes appealing to the senses isn't the most practical way to advertise.
For example, it is a good idea to come up with a marketing strategy that adapts to the product,
especially digital products.
The flexibility of this kind of products is extremely important,
so it is very common for advertisers to form one single layout for all of their ads -
the visual, the medium, even the majority of the content -
and simply update the ad each time they come out with a new version.
Remember, advertising is all about stirring up the right feeling in your potential customers,
whether by stimulating the senses, appealing to the intellect, and so on.
Once the customer experiences the ad,
the important thing is his or her reaction.
Someone could love the ad you made,
but unless he or she considers buying the product,
you have failed to get the reaction you were looking for.
So once you have successfully reached your target customer
and you have his or her business,
often you will want to expand to a larger market.
More often than not, the same marketing strategies you used in your small campaign
may not work for a larger audience.
The larger you scale your product, the more factors you must consider.
For instance, Apple operates worldwide,
so they must tailor their advertising for each market they enter.
Often you'll see Apple ads on international flights that appear not only in English,
which is the lingua franca of most regions,
but also in the native language of the majority of passengers.
I traveled to Russia last week,
and it was really interesting to see the same Nike ad that I have seen a hundred times -
except this time it was in Russian!
Okay, going back to the medium of the advertisement,
even after choosing to create print ads
(instead of radio announcements, television commercials, etc)
there is more to consider.
If you print your ad in a newspaper,
it will be read by a far different audience than if you print your ad in a popular magazine.
Would you put an ad for the new Justin Bieber album in a newspaper?
Probably not, because that product is most suitable for youths.
Let's face it - do you know anyone under the age of 25 that buys a newspaper?
Now let's try a few strategy exercises.
Imagine you are a company that is aiming to improve the environment by making products that reduce human waste.
How would you advertise your product?
Clearly it would send the wrong message if you put up fliers or other materials that cause lots of waste paper.
Consider instead putting commercials on the Health Channel, or buying ad space on websites like UNESCO.
Or here's another example: What is one great place to advertise suntan lotion?
How about a swimming pool?
It has the exact group of people that need the product.
Alright, one last thing.
Let's say you're filming a commercial for a water filter pitcher.
What would be good scenery to use for the background?
Think about somewhere calm and relaxing with clean, fresh water.
Can't you see how much more effective a commercial with the beautiful scenery and flowing rivers of a national park would be
than, say, water dripping from a tap?
So to wrap things up today,
think about the geography of your target market,
the type of marketing material you should use,
and the most effective way to appeal to the customer in order to make a successful ad campaign.
That is all I have for you today.
Make sure to read through chapter 8 for Monday if you have not done so already.
OK, now I'd be happy to answer...

Call me on that one.
Okay - I'll make a note of that.
Could you tell me your availability?
Sure. I am usually available during afternoons or weekends.
I'd prefer not to be scheduled on weeknights because I work part-time as a waiter.
That shouldn't be a problem,
since we don't stay open very late anyway.
Do you have any other employment experience?
Yes, I have worked at a few other places.
I was the baseball coach at Ridgemont High School last season.
I see.
And do you have any other experience that you would like us to note on your application?
Yes.
Last year I worked at the beach as a rescue diver.

actually, it expires in October.
Okay, so regardless you have it through the end of the summer.
When is your ideal time to work?
Since I work in the restaurant on weeknights,
I like weekends best - specifically Saturday mornings.

We do already have a lot of staff available on Saturdays,
but I do need an early morning shift lifeguard.
How early could you work Saturday morning?
I can get there by 6 o'clock if need be.

Great.
We can figure out other shifts for you to work when you come in then.
One last thing - just out of curiosity, where did you hear about us?
I heard your ad on the radio while I was driving this morning.
You know, I think you're the first person who has responded to our radio ads.
It's almost always people who have seen us in the newspaper.
Yeah, I don't have time to read through the newspaper every morning.

1291,IELTS Recent Actual Test 8 - Part 2,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-8---part-2,66,"Good evening, I'm Geoffrey Miller, from the University of Nottingham Student Union.
And in this week's free class, Carlos Garcia is going to tell us about safety around campus.
Over to you, Carlos.
Thank you, Geoffrey. And thank you all for your attendance today.
Also, I would like to thank the student union here at the university for organising this lecture.
Well, I have been serving and protecting the city of Nottingham for over 20 years now
as a member of the police department.
Does anyone know what type of crime is the most prevalent on campus?
I heard someone say drugs and alcohol -
that actually isn't too much of an issue.
Violence? Nope.
Actually, the biggest thing we worry about here is theft.
The nature of crime on Nottingham's campus is quite different from that of the surrounding areas.
Crime rates across the East Midlands are very difficult to control.
We'd like to see the rate stay the same for this calendar year,
but it's been increasing steadily over the past three years.
On campus, however, I'm happy to say that the overall crime rate has fallen this year.
You wouldn't think so if you have seen the extremely exaggerated stories in the media.
The media has done nothing but cause more concern about crime in our area.
Even the crime shows you see today are a little bit farfetched,
but at least viewers know they are not real events.
We'd really like to see more factual news articles out there
so the public can have a rational sense of the safety level of our society.
OK, let's move on to what to do when you see a crime.
Do not get involved if at all possible,
and do not draw too much attention to yourself by running away in a conspicuous manner.
Though most likely and hopefully you will not have to experience this situation,
if you are being mugged please do not try to resist.
Instead, be compliant and, seek help after the incident.
Like I said, though, it is highly unlikely that you will find yourself amidst a crime,
but it is important to be prepared should it ever happen.
We find that educating students and staff on the correct precautions to take is the best way to increase your safety.
Just remember to be smart when you're out late at night,
and avoid any area or person that looks suspicious.
I know it sounds obvious, but I cannot stress this enough.
It's also not a bad idea to have your mobile phone with you at all times,
but be careful.
If you're chatting on your smart phone on your way home,
you're a prime target for thieves.
I'd like to see a show of hands -
how many people have left work or the library after 10 p.m. to go home before?
A lot of you, right?
If you do have to go home late at night, please don't walk home alone.
More often than not there's someone there that will be walking the same direction as you at some point.
Walk home with a friend or coworker.
Even if you must use your phone to call someone that's nearby to walk with you,
it's always safer to walk home with someone.
So when you're walking home,
you may feel more comfortable with some sort of self-defense,
such as pepper spray.
Now, it's your call whether you want to carry something like this or not.
However, I absolutely advise against carrying a knife or any other offensive weapon.
All too often they can be used against you if you're disarmed, putting yourself in more danger.
For all those interested, the recreation centre offers a free self-defense class to all students every Thursday evening.
While obviously an introductory self-defense class may not equip you to fight off villains like a regular superhero,
it does come in handy sometimes.
After taking a self-defense class,
you will surely be more aware of possible dangers and how to deal with them.
So hopefully now you have a more complete understanding of the nature of crimes committed on your campus,
and how to avoid being a victim.
I know most students at the University of Nottingham are not the criminal types,
but remember that there is no barrier like a wall or something keeping nonstudents out.
There is no army force securing the borders, and I doubt anyone wants it that way.
The campus is generally a safe place,
but it's not immune to small crimes once in a while.
Alright. That's all I have to say for today. Stay safe!

1292,IELTS Recent Actual Test 8 - Part 3,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-8---part-3,73,"Hi Bobby, go ahead and sit down.
Tell me about your research project.
Well, I decided to research football,
and keys for success on a football team.
That sounds great.
What are the guidelines for the test?
Did the teacher talk to you about it in class?
No, everything is on a handout that was passed out.
It says that the first draft is due at the end of next week,
and the second and third are due later on in the month.
I don't understand why we have to keep revising and fixing it.
Is this assignment really that important?
Well, this project is a major requirement for passing 11th grade English and will go on your permanent record.
Oh really?
Does that mean it will affect what English level I am placed in next year?
Well, not exactly.
You need a good grade to move on, but it is your overall grade
and teacher recommendation that determines what level of English you are placed in next year.
Anyway, tell me about your topic choice.
Do you play football?
Well, actually it's because my father loves the sport.
He watches it every weekend.
Cool! It's a good idea to report on something you're interested in.
I see you worked hard calling players and the head coach to talk,
so let's see what information you got.
Well, you have to listen carefully to the first call on the recording.
It's really hard to hear because the background noise is louder than the person's voice.
Yes, it is a bit tough to discern.
I'm afraid the player's answer is too short as well.
You will have to interview him again and try to get him to give a better answer.
Okay.
I thought that might happen.
I will call him again tomorrow.
Moving on, let's look back at this question.
You asked, ‚ÄúTell me about a time when you learned a major life lesson through playing football,
and explain how that has shaped the person and player you have become now,
and how you hope to pass on that lesson.‚Äù
It is a great idea for a question,
but in an oral interview it is far too complex.
I would advise you to break it up into multiple parts to get a better response.
I guess you're right -
I wouldn't want to have to provide an answer to a question like that.
I will simplify it.
I found that when I asked players this question, it took too much time
because they were struggling to answer the question completely.
In fact, this is the question Joe Billings was answering when the tape ran out.
He did tend to ramble on all the questions, didn't he?
He sure did.
I would recommend that when you go back and interview players again
that you use a more sophisticated recording device.
This recording is spotty,
which indicates that the equipment wasn't working consistently.
Okay.
I guess it probably wasn't the best idea to use the sound recorder on my phone.
Hey, could you give me some feedback on the content of the report itself?
Sure!
Let's start by focusing on your topic.
While I like that you chose to cover football,
it seems inexplicit.
The keys for success of a player and team is quite an interesting topic,
but what is your thesis?
That is to say, what conclusions can you draw from your research?
I would suggest coming up with a strong thesis statement
and then shaping your report based on that.
Is it really too vague?
I put a whole lot of facts into it.
I list the top 10 goal-scorers in football history,
and later on provide statistics for a few of the most famous coaches and their records as coaches.
I think that's great that you included these facts,
but I think you focused too much on the facts
and not enough on connecting these facts to make your point.
Ah, I see. Okay.
So it looks like I have quite a bit of work to do before the deadline!

1293,IELTS Recent Actual Test 8 - Part 4,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-8---part-4,64,"Good morning. Today I am going to cover the daunting task of giving a quality speech -
a thought that makes most of us cringe.
In fact, 90% of all people feel nervous about public speaking,
about 10% of whom are described as genuinely terrified.
Hopefully when we are finished here today,
you all will be in the 10% of the population who do not feel nervous at all.
Did you know that lecturers tend to get more nervous if the speech they are giving is an important one?
It makes sense, right?
You probably wouldn't be nearly as nervous
to address your residence hall about the proper use of the recycle and compost bins
as you might be if you were asked to give the graduation speech
to your entire 5,000-student class.
So what is it that makes some people completely comfortable in front of crowds?
Some people think that the ability to give a good speech is a gift that others are simply born with.
This is almost never the case.
Public speaking can be learned with practice.
The first, most important thing you can do to improve your confidence in delivering a speech
is to prepare a quality speech.
Honestly, while the content of your speech is relatively important,
the audience will really only remember the last sentence you say.
It is a good idea to structure the rest of your speech
to lead up to this last point to really drive your message home.
This is a good way to ensure that your speech is well organized.
Once you are confident in the quality of the speech you have written,
the rest is just about your stage presence.
Let's go through some do's and don'ts of public speaking.
First, you want to command the attention of the room.
Do not - I repeat, do not proceed with your speech until the audience is paying attention.
Even Martin Luther King, Junior's ""I Have a Dream"" speech
wouldn't have made any difference in the world without the undivided attention of his audience.
To continue with the ""I Have a Dream"" example,
one of the reasons that MLK was such an effective orator
was his ability to speak with passion and engage with his audience.
That sort of charisma does not come from reading straight from paper.
Don't get me wrong -
it is a good idea to write your main ideas down on a note card, sheet of paper, or something.
But one factor that will consistently lead to a boring, forgettable speech
is writing down your entire speech.
Do not write your full speech down.
If you are constantly reading your paper,
you are not making eye contact with your audience,
and thus failing to really express the feeling that goes with your ideas.
I advise you write one or two ideas,
so, if you suddenly draw a blank you have something to jog your memory.
If you've written a good speech that you believe in,
those ideas should be sufficient to keep you on track.
Once you have those ideas written down,
give your speech a few practice runs in front of the mirror,
into your sound recorder on your phone,
or with a friend before it comes time to address a crowd.
That way you can hear how the ideas come across,
make sure there are no abrupt transitions,
and find out whether you're talking too fast or too slow.
Timing is important -
make sure you time yourself beforehand to see how long your speech is.
That is pretty much it!
With practice you'll be able to deliver an expert speech that engages and even maybe inspires your audience.
Just remember - speak with emotion.
No one wants to listen to someone reading from a script.
As I come to a close in my speech,
I'll point out that I have employed all of these tips that I have covered.
I practiced my speech ahead of time and timed it,
and I can even show you my one small index card with just three simple bullets on it.
It's as easy as that!

1294,IELTS Recent Actual Test 29 - Part 1,B1,ielts-recent-actual-test-29---part-1,85,"Good morning, ma'am, and welcome to ""Australia's Moving Experience""!
How can I help you?
Well, I... I hope you can help me. I'm so up in the air right now...
Just calm down, now.
Let me guess: you're moving and it has you a little confused.
That's it exactly.
You see, I'm relocating to the United States next month
and I'm having a hard time getting organised.
Here, fill out your name and address, and let me ask you a few questions.
Oh, what should I call you?
My name is Jane, Jane Bond.
OK, Jane, first of all, what's your work phone number?
In case I have any questions about things.
My work phone is 94635550.
But please try not to call me too often there.
My boss hates personal calls.
So does mine, ma'am, so does mine.
And what address should we ship your things to?
My new company is letting me stay temporarily
at 509 Clark House,
that's C-L-A-R-K,
1137 University Drive in Seattle.
Seattle? Beautiful city, I hear.
Mountains right beside the ocean, almost.
Cooler than Australia, too.
OK, and when should we come pack your things?
Ah... I guess that would be on Monday, March 11th.
Do you want any help with an after-packing clean-up?
We do that for a small additional charge.
Yes, that would be helpful.
I promised the landlord I'd give her the keys back by 5 pm on Thursday, the 14th.
Great, we'll just schedule the clean-up for that day.
That way, the place will smell clean and there'll be no dust.
Well, you do think of everything!
Oh, how much is this going to cost?
Here is a list of our basic prices.
Oh dear, this seems rather expensive!
Yes ma'am, but you're paying for the best.
We're careful and we're fast.
Like we say, the only thing we break are speed records getting you moved.
Well... maybe that's so...
Oh, I nearly forgot to tell you.
I don't want my furniture shipped with me.
I won't be looking for an apartment till after I arrive in America.
Would it be possible to put my furniture in storage here for a month,
then have it sent along later?
Of course, we do that all the time.
A couple of other things.
Here at ""A Moving Experience"", we try to pack your things logically.
We don't just throw stuff in boxes.
Do you have any special requests?
You know, things you want packed in some special place,
so you know where to find them?
Like what?
Oh, I don't know... Things like dishes maybe.
Not to be rude, but you look like a lady who likes to eat.
Ahhh! Yes, I need my dishes and things where I can find them quickly.
Great. We'll put those dishes and cutlery in what we call the emergency pack.
Can you think of anything else?
Ummm, I do have an antique tea kettle my great-grandmother gave my mother.
I wouldn't want to lose that.
So I guess you'd better put that in storage with the furniture.
Grandma's tea kettle with the furniture, got it!
Say, how about things like your alarm clock?
You don't want to miss your plane on the big day, right?
Well, you certainly think of everything!
Yes, that's right.
I'll also need my alarm clock where I can find it.
Fine, we'll put that in your personal package.
And of course, we'll give you a list of where we pack everything.
So, all you'll have to do on Thursday, the 14th, is grab your luggage on your way out the door.
Um, I couldn't help noticing the new CD player you're carrying.
Is that a Samsung?
Why? Yes, it is.
One of their best.
Cost me nearly a hundred dollars, it did!
Do you want to take special care of it?
I mean it's brand new.
Take care of it, but nothing special.
You can just put it in storage with the furniture.
That looks like everything we need here.
I guess you're all set.
That was certainly quick.
Thank you, young man.
This has been a most moving experience!

1295,IELTS Recent Actual Test 29 - Part 2,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-29---part-2,90,"Good morning everyone,
and welcome to the 2nd Annual Wullaballoo Conference on Mastering Computer Languages.
I hope you all had a good trip.
Before we get underway with today's programme,
let me fill you in as to what's on tap for tomorrow,
Sunday, February 19th.
At 9 am right here in the Main Hall,
we'll be hearing a lecture from Dr John Smith about ""Computer as Teacher"".
Professor Smith, from the University of Melbourne,
is a world-class expert in the field of computer-assisted education,
and his talk promises to be both stimulating and informative.
Immediately afterwards, at 10:30,
there'll be a presentation of papers by various delegates.
That, however, will take place in the Garden Room on the ground floor.
If you don't yet know,
the Garden Room is also called the Ballroom,
and we'll be gathering at the west end,
the slightly raised area called Level 2.
Just look for the crowd.
If you get lost, there are signs in the foyer.
After all that thinking, talking, and listening,
I expect everyone will be a bit weary.
So at 11:15,
there will be a break for coffee, cookies, and other light refreshments.
These will be available at the aptly named Refreshment Stand,
placed by the door back here in the Main Hall.
Also, if you choose to skip the formal lunch,
you can buy a packed lunch at the stand for a reasonable price.
I strongly urge you, however, to join us at the formal lunch.
That won't be till one o'clock sharp,
so you have time to stroll about town a bit.
We'll be eating at the Sea View Restaurant.
The restaurant is located right here in the hotel, on the top floor.
It's a good dozen flights of stairs,
so I suggest you take the lift on the ground floor, eh?
If you're not fond of fish,
there's an all-you-can-eat barbecue available as well.
They even offer wallaby meat!
After lunch, we'll troop back downstairs to Level 2 in the Ballroom
for the presentation of further papers,
which will begin at 2 pm.
Please try to be on time.
I know you'll be a bit tired after lunch,
but the Ballroom echoes so with people coming in late.
Thank you in advance.
Once we've heard the papers,
we'll break for afternoon tea at 3:10 p.m.
No need to walk.
The manager of the refreshment stand has graciously agreed to have tea served in the Ballroom.
He's even promised us some special scones, baked from a recipe of his dear old Scottish grandmother.
Then, tea being drunk and scones munched,
we'll retire here to the Main Hall for some closing remarks and questions.
So, by 5 o'clock we should have the conference wrapped up.
But the fun isn't over!
This is Australia mates!
We'll be flocking to the hotel's own Palm Lounge on the east side of the foyer for an informal reception.
You can relax, mingle with the other delegates, and let your hair down a bit.
This will run from 5:10 to 6:10, though you're free to stay as long as you like.
The lounge manager has informed me that, for the duration of the actual reception,
you can have all-you-can-drink beer for $20 with purchase of an advance ticket.
And, yes, tickets can be purchased from any conference organiser
or at the front desk anytime between now and the start of the reception.
I suggest you come by tomorrow evening to pick up the tickets
since the conference hall only holds 800 people.
That way, you can also get your journey planned ahead of time
and be sure not to miss this truly memorable conference.
If you want cocktails, however, I'm sorry.
You'll have to pay for those at the regular price.
Oh my goodness! Speaking of paying,
I see I forgot to tell you a couple of things.
The first is about lunch.
The charge for the lunch will be $15 for all you delegates.
If you have guests with you,
the cost is $25 for the general public,
and $6.50 for children under the age of 10.
That's $15 each, not total for everyone!
Another item is about the lunch menu.
I very much urge you to try the fish.
I mean, look at the restaurant's name: Sea View.
As the name suggests, it is a famous seafood restaurant.
The chef is a Basque from Spain,
and he really gets quite put out when people ignore his fish specialities for burgers or barbecue.
If fish isn't your thing though, try the steak,
he makes an exquisite Filet mignon topped with bleu cheese and mushrooms.
Finally, if you'd like to buy a ticket,
you can have both lunch and unlimited beer for $35.
I should have mentioned that earlier,
but I am a bit forgetful.
Maybe I should avoid the beer after the conference, eh?
Well, I've said my bit. Are there any questions?

1296,IELTS Recent Actual Test 29 - Part 3,B1,ielts-recent-actual-test-29---part-3,10,"Hello... are you Professor Van Diezen?
Yes, I am. And who might you be?
Oh! Sorry, my name is Tina. I'm a freshman here.
They told me I should ask you for advice in choosing courses.
Well, that's part of what I'm here for.
Please come in and sit down.
Now, what are your questions?
I, I almost don't know!
Everything is so confusing!
Like what is a specialised course?
Oh, easy. A specialised course is one that is compulsory,
meaning it's a requirement for your major and regular,
so you can't place out by taking a proficiency exam.
That sounds pretty strict.
Then what are all these general courses?
I seem to have to take so many.
Nothing to be alarmed over.
These are courses open to all students and not directly related to your major.
The university offers these general courses to choose
so that you can become more well-rounded individuals.
For example, I see you're a Microbiology major.
So it might be a good idea to take some literature or history courses
so that you can know something besides all science.
You mean these courses are, like, for fun?
That might be one way to look at it,
but don't tell the literature professor such a thing.
Think of a general course as the opposite of a specified course.
A specified course is one that pertains directly to your major.
So can I take any Microbiology course I want?
Let's see.
Oh, those courses used to be open to Microbiology students only.
The good thing is, now it's open to students on a flexible schedule,
so it's not only for full-time students.
So the answer is yes, if you have the instructor's permission.
May I ask you why you chose Microbiology?
Well, I also like plain old Biology, too.
You know, full sized animals.
I might even become a veterinarian.
Could I take some Biology classes?
Well, they are open to full-time students only,
which I believe is what you are.
I don't know how a freshman would get along with Microbiology, though.
I mean, most of the students presently looking into it are from off-campus.
Off-campus?
Yes, you know, people who use it in their work at hospitals, laboratories, even a police detective.
Why did you choose Microbiology, if I may ask?
I don't think you've quite answered that.
Well, eventually I want to be a doctor.
At least my dad tells me so.
If I may say so, young lady, you seem a little uncertain.
Still, I think that might be a good idea for a career.
Of course, if you're thinking about being either a doctor or a vet,
you should take some Medical Science classes before you even think of applying to med school.
Great! What should I take?
There is one small problem.
The new Medical Sciences building is under construction,
so there are no experimental facilities available until next year.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait.
But don't forget to take those courses at the first opportunity!
Oh, bummer.
Is there any other course you'd recommend for someone like me?
Well, since you seem to like animals,
have you ever thought about looking into Environmental Science?
No, I never really thought about it before.
Is it worthwhile?
Quite! In fact, it's the fastest growing subject on this campus.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help noticing the long list of classes you've written out there.
May I have a look?
Oh, sure.
Medical Science, Statistics, Laboratory Techniques,
Medicine, Mathematics, Computing.
My, my, a bit of everything here.
Is it too much?
For your first semester, yes.
What I suggest is starting out by taking the compulsory courses.
Like we said before, the Medical Science can wait.
Consider taking that in your sophomore year.
I think I'd put off Computing, too.
I recommend to all freshmen that I talk to
to get the compulsory Mathematics out of the way as early as possible,
so take that one.
It'll be one less difficult course you have to focus on when the science lab opens next year,
and you have to catch up on classes like Laboratory Techniques.
Your major also requires Statistics so you have to balance two Math classes,
and no doubt you should take that.
Otherwise, get your required Medicine course out of the way by taking something theory-based.
Oh, of course and your Environmental Science class if you're interested.
The others can wait, though I think Computing is definitely a good idea,
even though it's not required.
I see too, on your paper there, you seem to have had high marks on the entrance exam.
Uhhh, yeah. I guess so.
Don't be shy! Have you thought about applying for a scholarship?
Do they have any?
I mean, my dad is always complaining about how much money it costs him.
In your department, there are actually three full scholarships available.
They cover tuition and provide $1,500 cash.
$1,500 cash?! Party!
Please, Miss. The money is intended more as a textbook allowance, not party money.
If you promise to behave, I'll show you how to apply.
Great, and thanks!

1297,IELTS Recent Actual Test 29 - Part 4,C1,ielts-recent-actual-test-29---part-4,10,"We've been talking about choosing building materials in the last week.
Now, a great many factors influence the choice of building materials.
You can't make a house of cards, right?
And ""people who live in glass houses..."" and all that...
Anyhow, today I'd like to say a few words about flooring.
Some artificial materials can be used, like plastic for instance,
which offer mixed blessings when used as a flooring surface.
On the one hand, plastic is cheaper than nearly any other alternative, short of bare ground.
Plastic also does not warp like wood.
On the other hand, the best that can be said about plastic is that it ""looks like"" wood or stone.
However, it cannot replace the real materials.
As I have mentioned, I'm fixing up a new house.
The decorator my wife hired told me,
""Plastic does a great job of looking exactly like plastic"".
Besides, it scratches easily, fades or discolours,
and starts cracking within a year or two.
So, if you're fitting out a sleazy hotel or plan to live in a trailer park,
go with the plastic.
Really, though, for all intents and purposes,
this leaves us with wood or stone as choices for flooring.
Stone and wood are alike in at least one respect:
both go through processing before they can be put to use.
Since few of us cut our own lumber or quarry our own stone,
this is not perhaps a pressing concern.
Still, do-it-yourselfers would do well to remember to buy only properly seasoned wood.
Unseasoned wood warps and a warped floor quickly becomes firewood
(and its owner quickly becomes poorer).
Likewise, except for dull-hued materials like slate or sandstone,
most stone floors are polished before installation.
The choice goes well beyond just wood or stone -
each type requires many further considerations.
A few special remarks are called for when considering wood, for example.
As always, aesthetics, personal taste,
and layout all play roles as well as the type of house or room.
Oh, and certainly don't forget the cost.
When it comes to cost, a rule of thumb is that the softer and less exotic the wood,
the lower the cost.
In the US, for instance, pine is both ubiquitous and cheap.
Mahogany is imported and exorbitantly expensive.
If you're on any kind of budget when remodeling,
it's really helpful to remember to go for the softer woods.
Aside from cost, there are still lots of different factors that are important in choosing the best flooring for the job.
Continuing with the example of wood,
one must consider the effects of each type of wood on the mood of the room.
When selecting the best wood to use,
particular attention needs to be paid to its grain patterns, texture, and colour.
In rooms where relaxation or deep thought is the aim,
(say bedrooms or the study) dark, strong grained woods are the rule.
Here the grain ought to match the furniture for a feeling of homogeneity.
In rooms where activity and motion are typical,
(dining room or living room)
lighter, finer-grained lumber is more suitable.
In such a setting, the wood grain might be useful in offering a contrast to the furniture.
This leads to a feel of subconscious excitement, in keeping with the room's function.
In either case, though, consult a decorator.
It is a decorator's job to know what materials to use to fit the function of the room.
Though some things about putting together a room are subjective and based on one's individual taste,
materials appropriate to a room's function are much more straightforward.
A decorator takes the needs of the customer and uses a mathematical formula, rather than subjective words.
Since feelings vary from person to person,
verbal descriptions of wood types tend to be ambiguous.
You want the wood you select, not something approximate!
And if you do decide to do it yourself,
remember that all wood must be treated with preservatives to enhance its appearance
and preserve its natural beauty.
In the case of stone, or ""quarry tile"" as flat-cut flooring stone is properly called,
a new set of considerations must be weighed up.
Simple colour aside, the degree of reflection must be kept in mind.
This is called the ""reflectance rate"",
which is expressed in a number between 0.0 and 1.0,
depending on the amount of light it reflects.
At one end of the scale is polished silver.
At a rating of 1.0, this shiny surface reflects nearly all of the light directed at it.
Numbers closer to zero describe materials that absorb more light.
Moving down the scale a bit,
we see the plastic that has been painted white has a rate of 0.8, which makes sense.
We know that the colour white reflects all other colours while black absorbs all colours,
and plastic itself is a relatively reflective material.
Materials that are denser and darker have reflectance rates much closer to zero.
The quarry tile I mentioned a while ago has a rate of 0.1.
As you may know,
quarry tile is generally dark brown and made from clay so it is quite dense.
Of course, there is considerable variation among types of quarry tile
because of the hue or treatment of the clay during its creation.
Does anyone have any guesses as to what material may have a rate of almost 0.0?
We can guess most of these materials are black in colour,
but plastic, wood, and even stone reflect some light.
One material with a rate of almost 0.0 is black velvet.
The texture produces almost no shine at all.
Carrara marble, despite its white hue,
is actually lower in reflectivity than black onyx!
In any case, the fact that tiles vary somewhat should not be forgotten.
A highly reflective floor would not be suitable in a library;
it would be indispensable in a ballroom (should your home be large enough to feature one).
Again, a rule of thumb is that ""light means lively"".
Since form and material follow function,
one should only use the more reflective materials in rooms
where the cultivation and expression of energy is important.
Bear in mind too that most types of stone cost more than all but the rarest of wood.
Of course, there is no reason why some rooms of a house should not feature wood floors or other stone tiles.
You can even mix the two.
A room with wood panels on the walls can have a beautiful stone floor.
My bedroom has white birch walls and a light blue slate floor.
The place looks like a Russian hunting lodge.
Remember, though, go with what feels right for you.
Good taste and the ""laws"" of interior design are the homeowner's servants, not his master.
It's only beautiful when you decide it is.
I mean, you're the one who lives there, not the decorator, right?
OK, are there any questions?

1298,IELTS Recent Actual Test 30 - Part 1,B1,ielts-recent-actual-test-30---part-1,90,"Good morning. I've been looking at your holidays to Australia in your brochure.
I'm thinking of going during the second half of next month.
Good morning. As you can see from our brochure,
we offer a wide variety of packages to various destinations in Australia.
Is there anything in particular that interests you?
Yes, my husband and I are very interested in the holidays in the Outback.
These holidays are becoming increasingly popular.
Would you like to arrange flights and accommodation with us, or just accommodation?
Can you arrange flights from Sydney?
Certainly.
OK, flights and accommodation then.
Right. You said that you wanted to travel next month.
Which date would you prefer?
I should point out that there are no daily flights available,
so if you have a flexible itinerary, that's better.
Well, we arrive in Sydney on the 15th of April
and we were thinking of travelling to the Outback on the 18th of August, er... I mean April.
OK. There's only one flight from Sydney to Alice Springs on the 18th, so I'll book you on that.
It leaves at 10 in the morning, which is quite convenient.
Shall I book two seats for you?
Yes, please.
As for your stay in the Outback,
you can see from the brochure that we offer three packages:
budget, standard, and luxury.
The budget package is about 500 Australian dollars.
The standard package is about 700 and the luxury one is approximately 1,000,
though it does depend on exactly what you would like regarding extras.
Which one would you prefer?
Well, we can't decide between the budget and standard options.
Ah, well, actually, just looking at my computer here,
on the date that you want to fly into Alice Springs,
there is no standard accommodation available. It's fully booked, I'm afraid.
That's OK.
We think that the cheapest one should be fine for us.
We don't mind roughing it for a few days and we don't expect to be spending much time at our accommodations.
We prefer the outdoors.
Right. Let's look at the room options.
First of all, would you prefer a non-smoking room?
Yes. Neither of us smokes.
OK.
Oh, before I forget,
could you book everything in my husband's name, please?
Yes, of course. Are you paying by credit card?
Yes.
In that case, I'll need your husband's name exactly as it appears on the card.
Of course. It's John A. Smyth.
That's Smyth with a ""Y"".
John... middle initial ""A""...
surname Smyth, S-M-Y-T-H.
Is that correct?
Correct.
Thank you. I'll just check the price.
The room will cost $100 a night plus $10 tax,
so $110 per night in total.
Is that OK?
Yes, that's fine. Book us for three nights, please.
Most of the guests like to participate in some special activities and trips while they're staying in the Outback.
Is there anything that interests you and your husband?
Yes, there are several things we'd like to see and do.
We'd definitely like to visit the Cultural Centre.
Yes, that's very popular.
It's within walking distance of the accommodation and it's free.
It's also a great place to pick up souvenirs of your trip.
We were thinking about visiting one of the nearby farms.
There are two farms nearby - a sheep farm and a kangaroo farm.
There is also an opportunity to ride camels in the desert.
Have you ridden a camel before?
No, but it sounds like fun.
Could you give me some more details about the kangaroo farm and the camel ride?
Certainly.
The kangaroo farm includes information on how the animals are raised
whilst the camel ride provides information on desert flora and fauna.
Which would you prefer?
You can arrange to see the kangaroos in the wild if you like, rather than on a farm.
That sounds perfect.
OK, we'll go on the camel ride and see the kangaroos in their natural habitat.
OK. I'll arrange that for you.
I forgot to mention that the journey also includes a stop at a place of aboriginal artwork.
It's a place well-known for its stone carvings of animals and mythical creatures.
That sounds great!
Are the carvings in the desert?
Yes.
Wonderful!
Well, that's perfect then. I'm sure you'll have a lovely trip,
but remember that you need to take care in the sun.
Yes. We're really looking forward to our trip.
We really want to try to experience the Dreamtime under the stars.
Of course. That's what a trip to the Outback is really all about.
Yes.
Now, how about the cost...

1299,IELTS Recent Actual Test 30 - Part 2,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-30---part-2,55,"Continuing our broadcast of public service announcements,
Worldwide Helpers announces upcoming vacancies for a number of volunteer worker positions.
All applicants must meet the following requirements.
First of all, applicants must be over 18 years of age.
The company apologises, but there can be no exceptions to this rule.
Second, persons interested in these positions may not have police records.
Minor traffic offences like a parking ticket are, of course, no problem.
But, and I quote, ""past and present drug users and sex offenders"" need not apply.
The employer will, of course, check with the police to verify your clean record.
In addition, applicants must supply references from past or present employers or teachers along with their recent CV.
These references must testify as to the applicant's work habits and/or character.
Remember, these are references from employers or teachers.
A note from your dear old Mum won't do.
Worldwide Helpers assures me that they will contact these references to confirm they are genuine.
Although all positions are volunteer, the employer will reimburse some of your expenses.
For example, they will pay for transportation to and from the job site.
Aside from that, the cost of phone calls is covered.
As for the positions themselves, there are three types.
The first involves assisting persons confined to wheelchairs.
For this position, volunteers must be physically fit and in excellent health.
They must be able to lift at least 150 pounds.
They should also have a current First Aid certificate from the Red Cross.
But the most important requirement is that the volunteer must have his own car.
On Tuesday afternoons, the volunteers take their clients to various scenic spots around the city to experience and enjoy nature.
If you don't drive, but you'd still like to get involved,
the centre has a number of openings for people to read to the blind.
Readers must, of course, read English clearly.
Persons with no foreign accent are preferred.
For these positions, you must be available on Monday mornings.
Oh, wait, I see a note here.
There is one opening for someone who can read Urdu.
Apparently, there is a Pakistani blind person who'd like to hear his or her native language.
But the other positions are all in English.
And finally, there are a limited number of volunteers needed to care for disabled children.
I'm sorry, but the information I've been given does not say how many children or what disabilities they have.
In any case, you are needed to care for the children for one week in August.
Apparently, this will be at the close of the summer holiday.
I would guess this involves helping them with the routine chores of daily life.
Again, volunteers for this position must know basic First Aid,
be in good health, and be able to lift up to 75 pounds.
All applications for this position have to be submitted no later than Monday, August 8th.
Applications may be made either by a regular postal service - the ""snail mail"" - or by e-mail.
The mailing address is Worldwide Helpers, Post Office Box 651,
East Surrey BY8 99C.
Please write ""ATTENTION: Mary Smith"" on the envelope.
Or you can send e-mail to
acrawfor@worldwidehelpers.org.
That's A-C-R-A-W-F-O-R
@worldwidehelpers.org
So get out there and do something good!
OK, our next announcement is looking for someone to ""facilitate"" tiger breeding at the London Zoo.
And, get this, it's a ""strictly volunteer"" position.
That means you don't get paid!
Oh my God...
I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen, but I just have to laugh...

1300,IELTS Recent Actual Test 30 - Part 3,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-30---part-3,90,"Are you just leaving the library now?
I saw you get there at 8 am!
Yeah, I've been there all day.
What for?
They hired a cute new librarian or something?
I wish.
No, it's the presentation that I will give in Environmental Science the day after tomorrow.
What's it about?
I heard you were really excited about the class.
And Dr Schnee also calls you for the ‚Äúarcane"" questions, as he calls them.
It's about environmental damage in the Yucatan.
Excuse me, what?
Or is that where?
Yucatan.
It's a state in Southeast Mexico.
So what's happening there?
Agriculture is having a really adverse impact on the environment.
There are too many farmers doing too much farming.
It's really destroying the forests and ruining the soil.
Deforestation is a major problem there now.
How did you learn about this?
I don't recall Dr Schnee saying anything about it in lecture.
Yes, but my brother went there last month,
you know, to look at the old cities like the Mayan Indians built.
That's what first got me interested.
Your brother Tom?
No, Dick, Harry's twin.
Anyway, he told me how few trees there were now and how much empty ground that grows almost nothing.
He said the place looked more like the desert than jungle in some parts.
It brought environmental damage.
So I started looking for materials in the library.
Here, look at this magazine.
What's in it?
It's an old issue of ""National Geographic"".
It includes interviews with tourists who've been there in the past few years.
It's pretty bad. See the photos?
I see the photos, but one or two photos don't prove anything.
Then read what the article says. Right there.
The first thing it points out is how soil samples show it's hard for anything to grow there.
It says how an area of 21,000 square kilometres has lost most of its forest in the past ten years.
See, there are graphs.
As the number of farmers increases, the acres of forest have decreased.
It's an inverse relation.
So how big is that state?
I'm sorry, but I've never really learned the metric system.
It's bigger than the state of Massachusetts!
That's shocking!
Anything else?
There's lots of else.
Scientists say there's a ""growing area"" of about 10.5 square kilometres where nothing can grow at all.
It's like the beginning of a desert.
Oh yes.
What Dr Schnee called ""desertification"".
But, why can't anything grow there?
I've never really studied soil chemistry.
I'm just starting to look into that subject,
but my sister Marie is a geologist
and she says the problem is that the soil has too much saline,
with no plants helping to adjust the chemistry.
Apparently, that's a common problem with soil types throughout the areas with rainforest.
Once you lose the plant cover, it's difficult to bring it back.
Reforestation is almost impossible, even if the land is not being used for other purposes.
Wait a minute. What is ""saline""?
Saline is salt dissolved in water.
Scientists who've gone there have taken measurements.
They do this by gathering a sample of the soil and running a simple test that shows the ionisation of the solution.
The Geology Department in our own university has reviewed the soil at the site, too.
They're right. It looks pretty bad.
The level of salinity is going up.
But the plants that would solve that problem can't be planted in soil like that.
There is a narrow spectrum of salinity in which the plants will grow.
And once you pass the threshold, there is no way to put the problem right?
Exactly. It's possible that no one can do anything to stop the trend now.
All because of human greed!
Wait a second.
How do you know these ""scientists"" can be trusted?
What kind of reputation do they have?
Are they reliable?
Oh they're definitely reliable.
They include four members of the faculty from the Geology Department right here at MIT.
Here, study these photographs and check the damage yourself.
That's what Dr Horst who wrote the book here did.
He's newly appointed, but Dr Schnee says that he's brilliant.
So, where are you going now?
I'm headed over to the Geography Department to borrow a map for my presentation.
You know, this whole problem could have been avoided!
The farmers there in the Yucatan...
Uh, Pete??
What?
Go take a break! Leave some studying for the rest of us.

1301,IELTS Recent Actual Test 30 - Part 4,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-30---part-4,99,"Good afternoon, and welcome to Insect Biology 101.
I'd like to begin this course with a few remarks about good insects and bad ones.
Bugs are all around us and that's both a benefit and an annoyance,
sometimes maybe even serious harm.
First, let's talk about the good things that insects do for us.
Probably the most important insect for humans, and maybe for all other life, is the bee.
Bees help plants in the process of pollination,
and thus are necessary to most flowers and fruit-producing trees.
That is, they carry pollen from ""male"" flowers to ""female"".
If it weren't for bees, we'd have very few food plants and no fruit either.
In fact, there would be no ""we"".
No less a thinker than Albert Einstein pointed out that,
without bees, humanity would be dead within a year or less.
We'd starve. It's that simple.
That should maybe make us just a little humble.
A little less dramatic is the fact that bees also make the honey we eat.
Moreover, they produce beeswax, which is useful in candles
and it's also used as a first-rate furniture polish.
Sure, these may not be vital to our lives,
but they can serve as reminders of how important bees are.
That's a point I keep coming back to in this course.
Though, in all fairness, I should point out that butterflies aid in pollination as well as bees.
Now, here in Michigan, what's the worst part of summer?
Yep, that's right - mosquitoes.
But I'm talking about helpful insects, right?
So let's look at the dragonfly first.
If there were no dragonflies, there would be even more mosquitoes!
Dragonflies mainly eat mosquitoes and also a few other insects.
Yes, that's right.
They don't just fly around, and they also help to eliminate harmful insects.
So, the next time you see a dragonfly, don't you dare kill it!
Now let's talk a little about those harmful insects.
Take the mosquitoes I just mentioned as an example.
Not so many years ago, mosquitoes here in America weren't just annoying.
Some were even deadly.
They carried malaria and yellow fever.
My own ancestor, the Confederate General John Bell Hood,
lived through the worst battles of Civil War only to die at age 38 from yellow fever.
A pest, not a bullet!
Well, besides the mosquitoes, in summer there is also a kind of insect that never seems tired.
Right, that is the fly.
Before I go on talking, I must mention an African fly called the Tsetse fly,
which feeds on blood and can cause serious diseases in the people and animals that it bites.
Besides, it is still a bearer of sleeping sickness,
which affects around 300,000 people every year in Africa
and can be treated only with toxic drugs that are hard to administer.
Worse still, the drugs sometimes don't work.
Other insects, of course, destroy food crops.
In China, for instance, locusts continue to be a danger to the harvest in some areas.
Less important, but still annoying, moths eat people's clothes and dust mites slowly destroy carpets.
Worse, but still in the home, termites or ""white ants"" eat wood - the wood of your house.
If they are not stopped, they can eventually destroy the whole building.
Usually they seriously damage a building before anyone even notices them.
So, as we all know, insects can be a real trouble.
So, what to do?
You can go ahead and start killing harmful insects.
In the early decades after the communist revolution in China,
Chairman Mao encouraged the people to swat every fly they could see.
Slogans on the walls of buildings called them ""Little Capitalists"".
But flies reproduced too quickly for this to be a long-term solution.
For some decades in the West, to kill insects with chemicals seemed a good remedy.
Unfortunately, chemicals can only be used in a limited area for a limited time.
It's a small-scale solution.
The insects come back.
Worse still, some of the poisons used like DDT were found harmful to the environment.
Many kinds of wildlife, like hawks, were harmed.
And people in chemical-using rural areas have one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the world.
It's no secret that chemicals remain harmful to humans.
Like all species, insects adapt to their changing environments at an amazing rate.
When a new chemical is introduced to their habitat,
the insects that survive are generally the ones with some way of resisting the harmful effects.
They then breed with the other survivors,
and just like that insects become resistant to most poison in a few generations.
An insect generation, remember, is a couple of months at most!
So, again we have to ask: what to do?
Well, there are biological solutions.
Some of these are pretty simple.
One is destroying the insects' habitat.
You take away their home or food.
Cleaning your kitchen is the best way to prevent roaches.
No garbage: no food.
Getting rid of marshes and swamps eliminates mosquitoes.
Other solutions might include bringing in dragonflies or bats in areas where mosquitoes are many.
This is a cheaper alternative to chemicals.
Biological methods like this also bring no extra pollution to the environment.
But you have to be careful.
If you change the environment too much, you might be hurting other forms of life accidentally.
One recent method of controlling insect populations involves interrupting their breeding cycle.
What does that mean?
It means ""birth control for bugs"".
Insects are provided with food that makes them unable to reproduce.
Since they can't have babies, the population disappears, or nearly so.
And since no young are born,
resistance is not a problem with no young insects developing increased resistance.
Interrupt the life cycle, eliminate the bug!
It's clear that we must have an understanding of the life cycle of the insect.
At least, that's the plan.
We'll go into more detail as the course goes along.
Now I will stop here to see whether you have any questions or not.

This is Kelly. How may I help you?
Yes, I'm calling about one of your rice cookers I just purchased.
What seems to be the problem, sir?
Seems? There's no seeming about it!
The blasted thing shoots hot steam all over the place, that's what!
It nearly scalded my hand when I went to open it.
While it could have killed the cat or something. It could have exploded and killed my wife and me!
Sir, sir, please calm down.
As long as the steam escapes the cooker, it won't explode.
So you're telling me there's no problem!
Are you calling me a liar?
Sir, no one is calling you a liar.
Yes! So I demand a full refund!
Under Pressure will be happy to refund your money, sir.
Now I just need some basic information.
OK, OK. Sorry. I do tend to get a little hot under the collar.
My wife tells me to slow down...
So, what do you need to know?
Sir, don't worry. I just need to ask you the model number of the cooker.
Hmmm...
where are my glasses? Ah, here!
Let's see...
It's R242.
R242? OK.
And how much did you pay for the product?
89.99 pounds.
It was on sale, I guess I should tell you.
Thank you, that's honest of you.
Now, where did you buy the cooker?
Which store and which branch?
At that big Electric Life appliance store downtown.
The City Centre Branch?
That's the one.
And you say the problem is that the steam escapes?
Yes, it does!
No problem, sir.
If there's steam escaping, clearly the cooker is broken or defective.
So we have an R242 cooker with an escaping steam problem.
It was bought from Electric Life's City Centre Branch for 89.99.
Is that correct?
Yes, that is correct.
Oh, I nearly forgot. When did you buy the cooker?
Just as soon as my wife got the crazy idea she'll live longer if she stops eating good English food: roast beef and mash.
No, all she says she wants is rice and vegetables and sauces you'd not soak your feet in!
Sir, sir! When did you buy it?
Oh, there I go again. Let's see...
we bought it just 6 months ago!
We hardly used it either.
But 6 months? Is that too long?
I mean for the warranty?
Very well, that's well within the warranty period.
Now, what's your name and address?
Name and address! What for?
Sir, it is company policy. If you want your money, you must inform me.
Money you say?
Oh, my name is Herbert Hewitt and my address is 84 Park Road.
Is that here in Coventry?
Yes.
The postal code is B0241DJ.
But I don't think sending things in the mail is very secure or very efficient.
I mean...
Don't worry, Mr. Hewitt, don't worry.
We can credit the money to your credit card.
You do have one, don't you?
Yes, that's how we paid for the cooker.
Oh, yes. We still have the number on the computer.
I only need to ask your card's expiry date.
I'm afraid I never give that sort of information out.
I mean, once you have that, anyone could go charging things and...
Sir! I said your expiry date, not your card's password.
Oh, er, yes. Foolish me.
Of course, you didn't say ""password"".
Let's see.
That will be April 2008.
April 2008.
Very well, your card still has nearly 2 months left to go.
We'll get that refund right to you, probably by 5 o'clock this evening.
You had better!
If I don't get my money...
wait, wait. Yes, I know I'm losing my temper again.
I really am sorry.
I haven't had my medicine today.
And sir, just one more question for our record.
How often do you go shopping at the City Centre Branch?
Oh, well it's hard to say.
I suppose maybe once a month.
But I can tell you this, if I don't get my refund, I'll never shop there again!
Oh.. I think it's time to start looking for another job!

1303,IELTS Recent Actual Test 31 - Part 2,B1,ielts-recent-actual-test-31---part-2,94,"Hello everyone, and welcome to the University of New South Wales.
The first thing I'd like to do at today's Orientation Session is get you all oriented!
That means tell you the location of some useful facilities and services.
So, first of all, take out the maps we gave you all as you came in the door.
The map is the big yellow sheet of paper.
As you can see on the map, North is at the top, South at the bottom, et cetera.
Which way's North?
Well, look through that window on my left, your right.
See the rising sun?
That would have to be East.
So North must be directly behind me.
Now, we are at the campus' Main Gate.
The Recreational Facilities are on my right hand and its opposite is the Student Centre.
No questions? Good. Pretty easy, right?
OK, did everyone eat breakfast at the Student Food Service this morning?
Was the food good?
Yes, yes. I am joking. I've eaten there, too.
So after a meal like that, you must be eager to go to a doctor. Right?
Well, I have good news for you:
the Student Health Centre is located about half a kilometre straight north of here.
Look on your maps.
You see the street on the east side of this building?
Ned Kelly Avenue?
Just follow that about 500 metres,
and the Health Centre will be on your left at the third cross street.
Now, I know you all just got here.
So you must be wondering how to tell your folks you've arrived safely,
how much you miss the dog, and how you already need more money.
If you don't have an Iphone, you probably are wondering where to find a computer.
Well, I have good news.
If you go straight out of this door and walk down the Garden Street,
you'll see the Internet Unit on your left side, just next to the Gym.
The hours are posted on the door, and the computers are free,
but you must bring your student ID card with you.
Like I tell everyone, if you need help with anything,
you can probably find right here in the Student Centre.
Do you see the 4 buildings there between the Student Centre and the library?
Those are the dormitories.
The men's dorms are the two on the south;
the women's the two on the north.
OK, I'm sorry to have to tell you,
but the university has been doing a lot of repairs and remodelling, and it's not all done yet.
So there may be some small problems with your dorm rooms.
Maybe the window doesn't open.
Maybe an air conditioner is missing or does not work.
If there are any problems, you can go to the Complaint Office,
which is right beside the Teaching Building between the Parker Street and the Crammer Street.
Just tell them your problem and they should have it fixed by the time you graduate in 4 years.
I'm joking, but please be patient.
There are a lot of little things they need to take care of.
Tired of the school food?
No? Give it a week.
Or maybe you just need a place to get coffee in the wee hours of the night during one of those marathon study sessions.
Either way, you definitely have to check out the little Cafe just past the women's dormitories.
They've got free Wi-Fi, so a lot of students saddle up with coffee and a bagel for hours on end to get work done.
As for the dorm rooms, I have some bad news and some good news.
The bad news is the rooms are small and you'll probably be sharing space with at least three other students.
The good news is that each room has its own bathroom.
What's good about sharing a bathroom with three strangers?
Hmmm... good question.
OK, call it bad news and worse news.
Hey, maybe try this for good news: each dorm has a kitchen.
If you want to make snacks or meals, you can do it there.
You can buy food containers at any campus convenience store, so you can store your food in the kitchen.
But a word of warning: you should definitely write your name on your food containers.
Sad to say, there are food thieves among your fellow students.
Speaking of thieves, a word about security.
I mean this is Australia and we do get drunken bushrangers wandering onto campus.
Each of you will be given a key for your dorm room.
Don't lose it.
You have to pay for any replacement and fill out a bunch of papers, too.
Red tape, huh?
Your key does not work for the front door of your dorm, however.
To the right of each door, there's a keypad with numbers.
When you move in, they will tell you the code you use to enter the door.
Please do not tell the code to people who do not live in the dorm.
Let's see. Have I forgotten anything?
Oh, yes. Most of you are not rich, correct?
So when your clothes get dirty, you can't just throw them away and buy new ones.
That means you have to learn to do laundry.
Or, men, that means you have to hurry up and get married.
If you decide to wash those clothes and not get married, there are laundries in each dorm.
Where? Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.
The laundry for each dorm is in the basement.
Some real good news this time: if you are a student, it is free.
You do have to buy your own soap, however.
The laundry closes, by the by, at 11:30
And, now that I've mentioned 11:30,
please remember the dorm doors are locked at 11:30 p.m.
Your code will not work.
If you want to get in, you'll have to call the night watchman.
Don't worry, you can get that number at the Dorm Office.
Yes, the Dorm Office and the Complaint Office are the same office.
All right, then. Before we continue, are there any questions?

Professor Dundee? We're ready to make our presentation.
Oh, yes. I did say 1 o'clock, didn't I?
Please, sit down.
So, who goes first? Bruce? Or you, Betty?
I guess I could. Bruce is always a little shy.
Not after he's had a lager for lunch, eh Bruce?
Heh, heh. No, Betty really should go first.
OK. Well, I'm reporting on the effects of different marketing strategies on the cheese and oil markets.
Different strategies obviously affect the sales volume differently.
I looked at the sales in two countries, New Zealand and Colombia.
And what did you find, pray tell?
Well, in New Zealand, the sales of both oil and cheese have declined pretty steadily.
And in fact, the sales have decreased more quickly than the population.
On the other hand, in Colombia, the volume of sales for both products has remained the same.
Wait, so you said sales in New Zealand have been going down?
Correct.
Suppliers have introduced two new upscale brands of each product,
which are a bit expensive but very tasty.
The big ad agencies are trying out a new series of ads that shift the focus from health to great taste.
They think that will get sales moving up in New Zealand,
where the population is less affluent and generally less health-conscious.
Brilliant. Thank you. And Bruce?
Uhhh... yeah. My report is about chocolate sales in Italy and Germany.
The two countries' marketers have found out that you have to market chocolate differently in each country.
For example?
In Italy, ""Kostig"", the most expensive brand,
pays shop owners to put the candy just about knee-high for an adult.
I don't see...
For little kids, that's about eye level!
That bright red candy is the first one they see, so they buy it!
Even better, they start telling their moms to buy it, too!
So, you mean...
Well, I mean, in Italy if you locate your product at the right location of shelves, sales do great.
They say it doesn't matter much what brand of chocolate you're selling.
As for Germany...
""Das Land der Schokolade"".
Huh?
That's German. It means ""The Land of Chocolate"".
Germans love the stuff, so people make a joke and call Germany that.
Oh... uh, right...
So, you were saying?
Well, like you pointed out, Germans love chocolate.
But they're thrifty.
For a long time, the biggest selling brand was ""Schmutzig"",
mostly because it was the second cheapest, but didn't taste too bad.
Again brilliant!
A pretty good job, both of you.
Tell me, what do you plan to investigate next week?
I'm especially interested in the effects of colour on sales of products,
so I'll be looking at ads for cosmetics and cleaning products in the local market.
You know, like the distinct orange colour of Mr. Muscle, lavatory cleaning products.
And you, Bruce?
I'm focusing on the effects of different containers on sales of cookies.
So I'm going to look into packaging for cookies and how the materials they use will affect the image, and in turn sales.
You know, most containers are paper,
but some expensive cookies come in metal boxes.
The shiny metal boxes catch people's attention
and the image remains in the memory longer.
Well, it sounds like you two are all set.
But as always in this course,
I urge you both to pay much more attention to the advertisement extensions.
That's often the key.
Alright, any questions for me before you go?
No, I think I'm all set. Thanks!
Me too. Thanks, Professor Dundee. See ya later.

1305,IELTS Recent Actual Test 31 - Part 4,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-31---part-4,91,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you to our exhibition,
""Two Centuries of the Bike"".
Let's stroll around the exhibition, shall we?
Although there were a few early efforts back in the 1700s,
you didn't really see many bikes till, say, the 1830s in England.
Bikes were a response to the rapid growth of cities early in the 19th century.
Cities like London were getting too big to walk across!
The early bike let people travel with less effort than walking.
Plus a bike was a lot cheaper than a horse!
Think of it. No one invented a bike for, what, 5000 years of human history?
Why did people do it then?
Probably because this was the start of the Machine Age:
people wanted machines to do all the work.
There were some drawbacks, however.
For one thing, there were no pedals.
You simply pushed yourself along using your feet.
Kind of like today's skateboard.
That meant you went fairly slow.
And uphill, you actually worked harder, pushing that two-wheeler.
Plus, the wheels were made of wood covered with metal, as you can see from this model.
So the downside was that the ride was quite uncomfortable on most roads.
Only a few gadget lovers had or used them.
By the 1860s, though, improvements were being made.
As you can see from this specimen, metal frames had become the rule.
They're more durable than wood, and they don't warp in the rain.
The biggest improvement however was the development of the chain and sprocket system.
They're connected.
This meant you did not push the bike.
You used pedals just like today.
You had to try harder to balance, so it took some practice to figure out how to use the pedals.
But it made the ride so much easier.
As a result, the good thing was that you could ride a lot more smoothly and with very little effort.
By the 1880s, another big change was the use of rubber wheels.
These became pretty common at that time.
Though the first ones were solid rubber,
the ride was a good deal more comfortable than the old iron and wood system.
This is a big consideration because the faster you go, the more you feel every bump.
Air-filled tyres - ""pneumatic tyres"" - didn't really come into use till around the year 1900,
as you can see from this exhibition over here.
That made the ride even more comfortable.
So, by 1890 or so, people were going a lot faster and a lot more smoothly.
There was one problem when you were going quickly and comfortably:
""OH NO! HOW DO I STOP?""
Yes, we all laugh now.
But for a long time, the only way to stop was drag your feet.
That didn't work very well and it would be dangerous if you were going fast.
In the crowded cities of those years - New York, Chicago, and so on,
you'd get killed if you couldn't stop for, say, a streetcar.
Plus look at this bike.
The front wheel is nearly a metre and 2/3 tall!
They made them that way so you could see over people and wagons.
But you couldn't drag your feet.
This model is called a ""velocipede"" - a ""speed pedal"".
Another characteristic of the bike in this period is that it has 2 equal-sized wheels,
which signalled a big change in bikes.
For with the velocipede, brakes appeared.
If you wanted to stop, you just pushed the pedal backwards.
Doing that stopped the back wheel of the bike.
This technique worked a lot better than dragging your feet or jumping off the high seat there!
This meant that bikes became a great deal safer.
It would've been safer if people wore helmets,
but the first bicycle helmet wasn't invented until years later,
and even then it was little more than a leather ballcap.
It really wasn't until the 1970s that the bike helmet was modified to provide some real protection.
Before continuing on to look at developments since the 1890s, let's say a word more about safety.
Everyone knows if you're going downhill, you can get going dangerously fast.
To go more than a hundred kilometres an hour isn't all that difficult!
But even on level ground it's easy to go too quickly.
On a city street, today's bicycles can be ridden at a speed of over 40 miles an hour, over a short distance.
That's about 64 kilometres an hour.
Remember you're on a bike, not in a car.
There's nothing to protect you.
People are killed in single-bicycle accidents every day, just from hitting the road.
A good rule to remember is, if you're going faster than the cars, slow down.
And please wear a helmet.
Nearly one quarter of the epilepsy cases come from head injuries in accidents on bikes and motorcycles.
I don't mean to scare you, but safety is everyone's business.
What? Now that's a good question.
Why are today's bikes so much faster?
Well, it's not just that today's athletes are faster.
The answer is partly mechanical.
If you look closely here, at the back wheel you'll see a number of gears.
Changing gears is what makes those fast speeds possible.
You can shift gears depending on the terrain and how hard you wish to pedal.
So you can put it on a higher gear for downhill,
and a lower gear for uphill travel to make it easier to climb that slope.
You'll notice this gear-shifting mechanism is attached to the back wheel,
and when the rider shifts on the handlebar gear shifter,
the chain moves to the appropriate sprocket.
And, speaking of changing gears,
let's look over here at our ""Tour de France"" exhibit...

1306,IELTS Recent Actual Test 32 - Part 1,B1,ielts-recent-actual-test-32---part-1,75,"Hello, how may I help you?
Well, I've been seeing these yellow boxes in front of a lot of houses in my neighbourhood.
just wondered what they were for.
I noticed your phone number on all of them, so I called.
Could you tell me about your business?
We do do recycling, but we're not a business.
Gaea's Guardians is a non-profit group.
We encourage recycling as a way of protecting the environment.
I don't know.
I mean it is a good idea.
But I really don't read the newspaper every day or anything.
And we don't come collect newspapers every day!
In fact, we only do pickups every other week.
Oh, well then maybe I could help.
I mean in my neighbourhood, there's too much rubbish lying around everywhere.
I'd like to help out, I guess.
That's great, sir.
You're doing the right thing.
OK, I need to get your contact information.
What's your name, please?
Peter Wisrough.
Peter... how do you spell your last name?
Wisrow?
No, actually it's Wisrough.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a terrible speller.
You're a good speller.
It's just that my family are terrible pronouncers!
You're quite a card, Peter!
OK, now what's your address?
No. 168 Bridge Road.
That's here in London.
How about if I have any questions?
I'm sending you a copy of our booklet, too.
The booklet has our phone number and our e-mail address,
helpline@blackcat.com,
that's helpline@blackcat.com
But I nearly forgot to ask, what's your postcode?
BS97PU.
PS97BU?
No. That's B as in ""boy"" S-9-7-P as in ""Peter"" U.
So, I'm guessing those yellow boxes I saw are for recycled newspapers?
Yes, that is correct, and it's free of charge.
Wow, that's good news!
Do you recycle anything besides newspaper?
Oh yes, we recycle most everything.
Glass, plastic, paper...
Oh, so I can put like glass and plastic bottles in the box?
Sorry again. Things like that you have to bring to our collection centre
And where is that?
Our main centre isn't that far from you.
It's actually right on the East Side of Central Park.
That new blue building?
That's the one!
Cool. Hey, what's with all those different coloured boxes outside that place?
Oh, that's for the different materials we recycle.
The blue is for metal, the green is for glass and plastics,
and the yellow of course is for paper.
Hmm, okay. I'll try and manage to keep all that straight.
Oh, no need, they're each labelled.
Great. So which one would I put magazines in?
Actually, they don't go in any of the bins.
Unfortunately, magazines can't be recycled because of the material they're made of.
It's such a waste.
So would you be interested in volunteering?
Um, I'll think about it.
Could you send me some more info?
Absolutely.
Along with the newspaper box, I'll be sending you our booklet,
""Savvy"", that is S-A-V-V-Y.
It tells you about what you can do to protect the environment in your daily life.
Plus it lists things you can do as a volunteer with our group.
Hey, that's cool, thanks!
My pleasure.
Do you have any other questions or concerns?
Nope, that's it!

1307,IELTS Recent Actual Test 32 - Part 2,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-32---part-2,83,"Welcome everyone to today's seminar on ""CV and Interview Skills"".
Remember, your CV is probably the most important document you will ever write.
It opens the door to your career!
And that job interview is probably the most important meeting you will ever attend.
It's like stepping through that open door.
So let's roll up our sleeves and get down to work, shall we?
First of all, I cannot possibly tell you everything you need to know about writing a r√©sum√© in the time we have.
But let me tell you that there are dozens of great websites on the Internet.
These will give you all the suggestions you need.
If you look at the paper I gave you,
you will see a list of the dozen most popular sites.
I can mention a couple of important points, however.
One is that your CV or r√©sum√© should not be too long.
A page is about right. Why?
HR departments do not have the time to read long documents.
Too many people are sending too many CVs!
After all, the economic crisis of 2008 is still very much alive.
Everyone needs a job now.
No matter how short you make that r√©sum√©, though,
you do not want to forget to tell HR how to contact your references.
References are people who will give you a recommendation for a job.
That's usually an ex-boss or a professor who knows you well.
Do not use relatives!
I don't care how much your mum loves you.
Also, when you send that CV, be sure to include a typed cover letter.
A cover letter is a letter where you, basically, are asking for a job.
It's like introducing yourself.
Make it brief.
The real information about you is on that CV of yours.
And, please make sure the letter is typed!
It doesn't matter if your handwriting is beautiful or not.
Companies only read typed letters.
Another point about CVs is you should try to have an attractive layout.
Maybe use different typefonts or colours to highlight information.
Some people include a photo.
You can find dozens of examples on the Internet.
Whatever layout you decide to use, however, avoid all spelling and grammar errors.
I used to be an HR manager.
If I saw a mistake, that CV went into the garbage.
Something you write in a CV is a description of your skills and experiences in an interesting way.
Mention training, too.
I mean these are what get you hired!
Do not just say, ""I have lots of experience."" or ""I have many skills"".
Tell that boss what you did, for what company, and when.
Better, tell him how well you did it!
Don't just say, ""I sold houses"".
Say, ""I sold two million pounds worth of houses in my first year"".
That is, say something to make the person reading excited and curious.
Finally, speaking of CVs, it's sad.
But some people actually forget to provide a contact number.
That's pretty silly.
You wrote a great CV, you have HR dying to meet you...
and they don't know how.
You forgot your phone number!
Oh sure, if you apply online, they have your e-mail address.
But you just showed them you're forgetful.
Why are they going to want to talk to you after that?
Alright, moving on to the actual interview,
I'll go over what you need to know by the end of it,
and what you can discuss and negotiate on later once it looks like you'll be offered the job.
First, there's working hours.
It's not that necessary to hammer out the hours off the bat,
especially since it's easy to come off as lazy when the first thing you bring up is how much you're going to have to work.
You can also find out more about possible promotions later on.
It is important, however, to get a feel for how much you'll be paid.
You should make sure the salary range is commensurate with what you're worth,
and if you're not, you can move on to better opportunities.
Being sure you're going to make what you want to live on
is much more important than issues like your pension,
you're all so young that your pension is not going to matter for quite a long time.
You should find out about what skills you must know for the job and what they'll teach you.
In addition, if the company will provide training,
you should find out how long the training period is and whether it is paid.
Beware of any jobs that want you to train for a long time without appropriate compensation.
Speaking of compensation, find out about holidays as well.
Do you get paid vacation time?
Are you allowed to take personal days?
Do you have to work on national holidays?
Once you work out these main issues,
you can move on later to details like the location and expected attire and whatnot.
Wow, that's a lot of information!
Let's take a break so you can think everything over and ask any questions you may have.
Don't hesitate to come and see me if you need any clarification on all this stuff!

1308,IELTS Recent Actual Test 32 - Part 3,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-32---part-3,10,"Hello, are you Dr Lindsey?
The Returning Students Advisor?
Yes, that's right. Are you Frank?
Your appointment wasn't until 2:00, but that's OK.
Please come in and have a seat.
Thanks, I like to arrive early whenever I have anything to do.
That's certainly a praiseworthy habit.
Let me see, it looks like you've taken a long break from school,
and I understand you wanted to have a chat about what you should study
if and when you return for further classes.
It's such a big challenge.
I don't know if I'm crazy for doing this or not!
Believe it or not, I know exactly what you mean.
Before I began working here at the university, I taught primary school for nearly 10 years.
It takes a lot of courage to go back to school!
I feel more shy and scared than the primary students I teach!
In the schools I taught, I found today's youngsters are very sure of themselves.
In terms of intelligence, I have a lot to teach them.
And the maturity level of much of my class leaves something to be desired.
But in terms of confidence, wow!
A lot more confident than I am now, that's for sure!
Stop fretting.
""A brave man is a coward who refuses to run"".
Let's talk about your strong points.
You seem an intelligent man.
What is it you would like to study?
You see, I've been teaching children for a few years,
but I think I'm happier teaching adults.
I think teaching students in middle school is much more satisfying
because they end up being much more grateful for your work.
If I may ask, what got you interested in teaching adults?
A lot of things, I guess.
I met my future wife back in my first year of college.
She always complains that I was more interesting then.
She says that now I talk like I'm 7 years old!
That's probably from being with children all day.
Haha! Again I know just what you mean.
My husband used to say the same thing about me when I taught kindergarten.
Anything else?
Well, yes.
Fairly often now I run into former students and we talk.
Some of them are getting close to being grown up.
I guess I think more and more about how people develop over time.
So, I'm interested in the results of education, you know, the final stages.
I see.
Well, coming back to the university can be both difficult and very rewarding.
There are some problems unique to returning students, you know, older students like yourself.
What do you think is your greatest weakness?
Well, I actually think my confidence is getting better.
I'm definitely overcoming my introversion
and starting to be much more comfortable in front of a class.
To tell the truth, I'm afraid I'm rather behind the times about many things.
It's more difficult for me to chase after the popular things youngsters are fond of
such as Iphone, Twitter, if you name it!
I think I understand.
How old are you, 35?
People at your age still go back to school for further education.
I was a bit the same way.
I mean I didn't study at university till after I had a family: a husband and one child.
My point of view was a lot different from your average eighteen-year-old girl's, I can tell you!
Gee, that sounds pretty rough.
A family and college?
Clearly you weren't unsuccessful though!
It was, Frank. It truly was.
My first term at school was extremely stressful.
But excuse me! You're not here to listen to my life story.
We're talking about your plans.
Is there anything unique I should know about you or your past experience or plans?
I'm afraid not. There is nothing interesting about my career or plans.
It's really not too impressive.
Now, I forbid you to talk like that.
This is your one life, and if you're not interested, why bother living it?
Don't be so humble, Frank.
OK, OK. My wife says I'm a wimp.
Let's talk about your dreams a bit.
You want to teach adults, you said.
What would you like to teach them?
Well, when I first came to college, I really liked Languages and Literature.
A lot of people have told me that for practical reasons,
it'd be more rewarding to choose Business Management as my major,
but I made up my mind to study Liberal Arts once I got the idea of going back to school.
I must say it's refreshing to meet someone who knows there's more to an education than computers and finance.
Let's have a look at the university course catalogue...
Excuse me, Dr Lindsey. Before we do that,
could I maybe ask you some questions about changes in university life?
I think I need to discuss that so I know what to expect.
Of course. I'm here to help you.
The biggest thing to get used to is the change in technology.
Professors present things on huge screens,
many of which are interactive computerised whiteboards.
You can write on them still and use them like a touch screen.
They're really handy!
No more sloppy scribbled notes on the projector.
Let's see, I doubt you'll be living in student housing,
so I won't go into all the improvements there.
Another major change that you'll enjoy is the plethora of resources available for students.
As a student, you have 24-hour access to the gym,
and library privileges that include the use of school computers to scan, copy, and print,
and of course the Media Library, which contains movies from all genres
and most of the movies listed on AFI's Top 100 Movies of All Time.
The dining facilities are also not what they used to be.
They offer choices for all diets, and you can expect a hot meal any time of day.
Wow, things really have changed!
I'll be sure to utilise all those great facilities in my time here.
Thanks for all your help, Dr Lindsey.
I think that's all the questions I have for now.

1309,IELTS Recent Actual Test 32 - Part 4,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-32---part-4,91,"OK and welcome back.
During the short break we just took,
several of you approached me with questions.
So, before going on with the orientation talk,
I'd like to address those queries.
As I've found, if one person asks a question,
probably a dozen others are wondering about the same thing!
The first question is whether Wassamatta University employs modules technology as an instruction method.
The answer is yes, we do.
At least that's what the university catalogue says.
If some of you don't understand what ""modules technology"" is, don't worry.
I googled the word but couldn't find it.
Apparently, though, it's a method of broadband, wireless access.
At least that's what an American company's website told me.
But again, don't worry.
If you need to know something more, your professor can tell you.
Another question someone asked me
was what tomorrow's workshop on ""Research Methods and Skills"" was about.
Well, research skills include any method you can imagine
for finding and presenting any information you need.
That's not just schoolwork, either.
Writing English - the native language for most of you,
and finding a job are also research skills.
And, yes, those will be addressed in tomorrow's workshop.
As you know, Wassamatta University
is one of this country's premier universities for the study of ""the dismal science"", economics.
Some of you, it seems, want to get a jump on their classmates.
During the break, half a dozen of you came up and asked me where to find economics tomes.
I know it's odd, but this school's library holdings are divided up between two libraries.
Economics books are in the old library.
If you look out of the window behind me, you can see it.
It's the red brick building.
Oh, before I forget, you economics types also need a lot of math, am I right?
Well, those Math books are neither in the old library nor in the new one.
They can be found in the Maths Department Building.
Why am I telling you this?
Doesn't ""the Invisible Hand"" guide economists?
Maybe it's good you asked:
in 2008, that Hand shoved most of the world economy off a cliff, didn't it?
Now I realise that most of you couldn't bring a computer printer or a photocopier from home.
So I'm sure you're already wondering where you can copy things like term papers,
Internet articles, and things like that.
I have some good news and some bad news.
The good news is that there are a number of places you can make copies.
These include both libraries and Student Union Building.
Now the bad news. I'm sorry to say,
most classroom buildings and academic departments do not have copiers students can use.
So most of the large buildings you see around campus do not have copiers for students.
The copiers there are reserved for professors and office staff.
Oh, yes! I nearly forgot to tell you.
If you need to have printing done, all the copiers available to students are laser printers.
Plus, for your convenience, you can pay using prepaid cards.
You can get those in the Student Union Building.
That just covers the questions put to me.
If you have more, please see me during the next break at 2:15.
Right now, though, I'd like to start to give you a rundown on the various facilities here on campus.
That way, you won't get lost so easily in the weeks to come.
I've been told that this year's incoming class features a large number of married students and parents.
So, you must be wondering where to put the baby while you're in class.
OK, right now, we're in the Student Union Building, right?
Remember the big doors in front where you all came in?
If you go out of the building, you can see the Nursery is just on the other side of this building.
It's only about 20 metres away!
Convenient, eh?
Next, we're all from different places around the country.
Some of you are from other countries.
That means we're pretty likely to get sick during the first months of school as we expose each other to many new viruses.
So, where's the doctor?
Of course, you need to find the Medical Services Centre
which is on the right as you leave the building.
Remember, that's the second building on the right.
And if you look out of that window,
you can see a lot of antennae and satellite dishes on the roof.
So that's what we call the Media Centre.
Yeah, I know, I think it's confusing, too.
The Media Centre is next to the Medical Centre.
The chairwoman of the Journalism School on the first floor
doesn't like it when people who wander in there mistake her for a nurse!
Chances are you'll have at least one Math class while you're here.
That red building there just outside to the left is the Math Department Building.
I know, it looks about as old as the subject of Math,
but I assure you that the inside is equipped with state-of-the-art classroom equipment
including interactive chalkboards and surround sound in every room.
Oh, can you see the back building there?
Yes, behind the Media Centre. Quite new, isn't it?
That's the new library, just decorated.
They're back-to-back, you might say.
If you look just to the left of it at the lower, older-looking building, you'll find the old library.
It's nice and quiet - perfect for those marathon study sessions during exam week.
Since the weather is so nice,
why don't we stop looking at our maps but go for a walk around the campus?

1310,IELTS Recent Actual Test 33 - Part 1,B1,ielts-recent-actual-test-33---part-1,79,"Good afternoon and welcome to Habitat Hunters.
You must be Joseph?
Yes, that's right. You said on the phone that I could come by at 2 o'clock.
Sorry, I'm a little early.
No, no problem at all.
In Calgary's market, you have to move fast if you want a good apartment!
Actually, I'd settle for almost anything.
I've been here ten days and the hotel is ruining me.
My father has me on a strict budget.
Sit right down here now, sir.
Let's talk a little about the places before we go have a look.
Now, we have 4 apartments available.
OK, could you tell me more about those 4 apartments?
Sure. The first one is on Beatle Road, just a block off campus.
It's a 3-bedroom with a bathroom and a living room and a great Italian restaurant right next to it.
How much?
Well, it's $435 a month, including Internet and utilities.
Okay, that sounds reasonable.
Any drawbacks to the house?
There's a really big garden, but it hasn't been taken care of over the years and
is just too big to clean up nicely.
Hmm. That sounds okay.
Tell me about the next option.
The other 3-bedroom apartment is on Oakington Avenue on campus.
It is right near the building where you have classes,
and the kitchen and living room are newly furnished.
Wow, that sounds like a pretty good option.
Well, it is a cool apartment,
but since it's a dormitory, the living room, bathroom, kitchen, and washing machine are all shared.
It would be nice not to have to buy living room furniture, though.
And how much is this one?
$400 per month for a bedroom with an air conditioner.
For a bedroom without an air conditioner, you would pay less,
$340 for it.
Yikes, even with the air conditioner, it sounds really inconvenient to have to share facilities.
I'll never cook if I have to walk down the hall to use the kitchen.
Yeah, that's true.
Anyway, the next place is a 2-bedroom on Mead Street.
Oh, I like Mead Street - that's off campus, right?
Yep. It's pretty cool, but it only has 2 bedrooms, plus a living room and a study.
But I want to live together with my 2 friends.
So you could make the study into a small bedroom if you end up living with them.
Also, we guys want a TV and DVD player since we're all so much into movies.
Well, this place has a great TV and VCR, but no DVD player.
No DVD? That's so weird.
Are any other facilities provided?
As you said, weird enough, it also comes with a washbasin.
Is there a washing machine?
I think we need that more than just a washbasin.
I'm afraid there's no washing machine in the apartment.
Wow, that's so old-fashioned!
Maybe it's not the best choice for 3 college guys.
How much is it?
Well, it's $600 per month,
but of course it would be cheaper if you made it into 3 bedrooms instead of 2.
Where is the apartment located?
It's 2500 Mead Street, where there are a lot of bars.
It would be affordable, but it would get pretty noisy.
And that sounds really expensive for an old place in a noisy area.
How about the last place?
This one's on-campus in the Devon Close complex.
It's a one-bedroom so it will be a little quieter than the Mead Street place.
One bedroom huh? That could be good for focusing on my studies.
What else does it have?
It comes with a living room and a study,
and includes a really nice lamp in the study that has a bunch of different settings.
You know what else is cool?
There's a dining hall downstairs so all evening meals are free.
You can purchase breakfast and lunch, but meals after 6 p.m. are free.
Wow, this place sounds too good to be true.
Is it really expensive?
It's alright - $500 per month, but there's no bathroom.
What? No bathroom?
Well, there's no bathroom in the apartment, but there's one at the end of the hall.
Hmm. Thanks, I think now I just have to decide whether I want to live alone or not.
Yeah, which one do you prefer?
I think I'd choose either this apartment or the one on Beatle Road.
OK. You'd better think about it, and then you can contact me ASAP
Fine, thanks for your help!

and I'm here from the Baltimore Department of Public Waste.
Thank you for coming out to our community meeting tonight.
I've got a few words to say about the waste collection here in Baltimore.
First, there's the sorted collection bins themselves.
They're made of sturdy, solid material,
so none of your trash can seep out or puncture the bin.
Also, since these things sit out on the curb overnight rain or shine,
they have to be waterproof.
We can't have water getting up in it and filling up the bin.
Remember to pay attention to which bin is which,
and sort your waste accordingly.
You should have a blue or green bin for recyclable garbage,
a yellow bin for unrecyclable garbage,
and a red bin for toxic waste.
Our citywide waste management is divided into 2 services.
The first is commercial waste collection, or trash collection from buildings.
The majority of building waste is paper, which goes in the blue or green bins.
You'll notice in your office buildings there are signs that warn you not to overfill these bins.
All that paper adds up,
and an overflowing bin is infinitely harder for collectors to carry to the truck and empty.
Aside from paper, another large source of building waste is metals.
Metals such as tin and aluminium can be put in the yellow recycle bins,
but metals like lead and copper should be disposed of in the red bins.
These heavy metals are harmful to the environment
and exacerbate our city's existing pollution problem.
That's about all the information you need for building waste.
Moving on to the second service,
household waste collection is probably what you primarily think of when you think of what we do here...
Many of the same guidelines apply - the sorting is the same, et cetera.
Please remember to keep garbage like kitchen waste in a plastic bag.
It makes collection easier and lessens the abominable rotten-trash smell.
So after we take your trash away, what happens to it?
We take all the garbage to one of a number of garbage disposal plants,
each of which is located in the middle of an open space of some sort.
No one wants to have their home or office right next door to a waste disposal plant, right?
Waste is collected and then disposed of once every four weeks.
A lot of trash can build up in that time,
so we're in the process of developing a plan to fund collection more frequently.
Ideally it would be collected weekly,
but we will likely have to settle for biweekly.
The garbage trucks make their rounds to clear the bins at night in order to avoid traffic.
I'm sure you've seen how much waste your own household produces in a given week.
Now imagine all the trash produced by all the households in Baltimore.
It's a lot, right?
It may surprise you that this amount is only marginal compared to commercial waste.
Yep, the main waste producers are actually businesses, industrial facilities, retail, and offices.
Hard to believe humans produce that much waste, right?
No wonder we have pollution problems!
Anyway, after all incoming waste is sorted,
recyclables are sent to a recycling plant,
while garbage and toxic waste are transported to their respective areas of the plant for treatment.
Items such as stones, which should not be disposed of in our bins,
are separated out and discarded.
Once the trash has undergone the treatment process,
it is compacted and disposed of with all the other trash
and finally, when the landfill space is full,
it is buried deep underground and in time something new is built on the land.
That's everything about waste collection.
Thank you for listening.
Are there any questions?

Hi, Ricky, how are you?
I noticed you weren't in Psychology today.
I'm feeling sick, so I didn't go to school today.
Would you mind telling me what I missed in class?
Sure thing. I'm sorry you're not feeling well!
Anyway, we spent most of the class talking about a new essay that Professor Johnson assigned.
You need to choose one of the bold headings from the note system and research it.
Wow, I picked the wrong day to miss class, huh?
You sure did.
Could you tell me the specific requirements of this paper?
Sure.
You need to find scientific research that supports your claim as one of your references.
It can be from some of the case studies we discussed in class, or you can find your own.
Or even better, you can conduct your own research!
I'm sure that would get you an A.
Have you decided what you're going to do yet?
Also, where are you getting your references?
Yeah, I'm gonna research facial recognition by infants.
I've already found a few experiments in scientific journals.
That would probably be a good start for you - there are tons of journals in the library.
Great idea, thanks.
I'm considering writing my essay on the effects of one of the psychotropic drugs we talked about in class.
I'm sure there is lots of stuff about it on the Internet.
Are we allowed to use information from the Internet?
Sure, you can use that as long as it's not your main source for information.
You'll probably want to cite some of the experiments we went over.
Good idea, thanks.
I'm gonna try to find some information from a bunch of different sources.
Are there any specifications on how the essay should be written?
Yeah, Professor Johnson wants it double-spaced.
It should be between 6 to 10 pages long.
6 to 10 pages? That's so much!
Ah, it's gonna take forever.
I know. The whole class groaned when he said that.
Anyway, you also need to put the title in italics...
Wait, each section heading, or just the main heading?
Only the main heading should be in italics.
I think section titles are supposed to be in the same format, but maybe in bold.
You'll have to check that in class next time.
Oh okay.
So I take it that the report has to be typed since there are so many requirements.
What are the other formatting requirements?
Yep, it's got to be typed.
Aside from that, there are still a few more specifications.
You should number each page.
Make sure it goes up in the top right corner.
Okay, I'll make sure to write that down.
I always forget to number the pages.
Do we need to title and date each page, too?
You need the shortened title on every page, but no need to include the date.
That should just be on the cover page.
Okay, thanks.
No problem.
Also, make sure the margins are 3.25 pixels wide.
What?
I'm not even sure how to do that.
Oh, it's okay, I can show you. It's really easy.
I think that's all the directions he gave us.
A lot of formatting requirements,
but we have the freedom to research many things that we like, so that's good.
Oh, I almost forgot,
remember to put down your ID number on your report.
Thanks so much for your help.
I'll see you in class Monday!
No problem, glad I could help. See you later.

1313,IELTS Recent Actual Test 33 - Part 4,C1,ielts-recent-actual-test-33---part-4,92,"Good morning and welcome to yet another lecture in Environmental Science.
I don't think I'm telling you a secret when I mention that water is a big worry here in Australia.
The stuff is scarce.
Perhaps that's why we drink so much beer, eh?
Seriously, though, a safe and reliable source of water is one of the great concerns of people everywhere.
Moreover, as the world population grows,
the pressure on existing water supplies grows greater and greater.
Think about it.
Our economic system demands that there be more and more consumers.
The growing number of people has been tied to climate change, including droughts.
So more people means less water.
But our economic system demands a high birth rate.
Forget about oil. Soon enough you will see wars for water.
Mark my words.
But today, I'm going to confine my remarks to Australia.
As noted already, here down under, the water supply is extremely scarce.
The only drier continent is Antarctica
and remember, no one really lives there anyway.
Moreover, in recent years, the wind patterns have changed.
Rain that used to fall on the country now falls out to sea hundreds of miles to the south.
Now, when I speak of people needing water, most of you probably think of drinking.
Certainly everyone needs water for drinking.
But surprising as it may sound,
drinking is not anywhere near being the main use for water.
Most water is actually used for washing.
When you take a shower, you probably use well over a hundred litres of water.
Every time you flush your toilet, that's about 8 litres.
But most people drink no more than two litres or so per day.
So, where to get water?
It could be obtained from rainwater,
but often rainfall consists of other harmful pollutants that evaporated with the water.
In fact, acid rain, an intense example of this,
causes harmful effects on the wildlife of the habitat on which it falls.
Water from underground could also be used,
though it is more difficult to contain
and often must go through an extensive cleansing process.
The purest water is found in rivers, creeks, lakes, and dams.
And, sad to say, Australia has precious few of these.
Really, how many of your home towns have rivers?
Year-round rivers, I mean.
The soil tends to be sandy, so water soaks into the ground.
Many places are rocky too,
so 87% of the rainfall is lost to evaporation.
That's almost twice the evaporation rate in my native Canada!
Speaking of rain, we already heard how rainfall is diminishing here in Oceania.
The quantity itself isn't the only problem, either.
Going back to the problems with obtaining rainwater,
a further problem is that rain is a useful source of water only if air pollution is fairly mild.
Again, you're in a situation where you can't win.
You need water where most people live.
People tend to build cities where rainfall is adequate.
But then modern cities tend to feature polluted air
which renders the rain far less easily usable.
OK, let's take a look at the table here,
you'll see it showing the relative pollution of rainfall in the world's cities.
The more people, the dirtier the rain.
This is becoming a huge concern for people in the West,
who want their water to be pure and safe.
Though reliable drinking water is important everywhere,
the concern in the West is reflected in all the government regulations and political campaigns aimed at solving this problem.
In contrast, there are not as many demands made on the governments in Asian and African cultures to improve the water,
as their focus is on other issues.
Now, whatever the source of water,
we can never afford to forget that all water is highly vulnerable to contamination.
Whether we're getting it from the ground, from bodies of water, or rainfall,
it is susceptible to a variety of toxins.
In fact, that's why we clean it before using it:
water carries with it filth and dirt.
This problem shows up in a number of different ways.
As humans and all other animals need water to survive,
it's no surprise to us that one of the most important domestic uses of water is for drinking.
Yet if you have old-fashioned lead pipes,
you may slowly be poisoning yourself by drinking that nice clear water.
The industrial pollution, farm chemicals, and leaky landfills
are well-known sources of contaminants as well.
So what is being done to ensure we Australians a safe and steady supply of drinking water?
There are a lot of initiatives that make admirable efforts to remedy this issue.
We'll be talking about this when we meet again on Thursday.
But, as a preview,
I can tell you that so far the amount of real solutions that have been produced is not nearly adequate.
Traditionally, we've been very free in this country.
That means that every person and every province tend to go its own way.
So the mechanisms for water management are, in a word, insufficient.
To begin seeing how this is so, I want you to read something before our next class.
Though a lot of previous data on water usage and water management are inconclusive
and have thus caused quite a concern,
we can learn a lot from the contents of reports written on the subject.
The basis for the government's water policy is the 1989 White Paper
reporting on ""Water Use: Present and Future"".
If you compare the numbers offered in the paper with those in the text,
you'll find that the report is rather untrustworthy.
Truth being told, I'm being too kind when I say that!

1314,IELTS Recent Actual Test 34 - Part 1,B1,ielts-recent-actual-test-34---part-1,73,"Good morning. City House Services. How may I help you?
Good morning. I'd like to arrange to have my house cleaned.
Certainly. I just need to ask a few questions.
First, could I take your name?
Yes, it's Barbara Hill.
Thank you. Next, is your house in London?
Yes, it's in Kingston in Southwest London.
OK, Southwest London and... er, what's the postcode?
SW105.
And what is the square footage and what rooms will we be cleaning?
The whole house is 268 square feet,
and there is no need to clean all the rooms.
I only want to have my bedrooms cleaned.
OK, how many bedrooms does the house have?
3 bedrooms.
Oh no, sorry, we used to have 3 bedrooms, but we only have 2 bedrooms now.
Are those single bedrooms or doubles?
Doubles.
Fine, 2 doubles...
There's one more room which needs cleaning.
It was used as a bedroom before, and now we have converted it into an office.
I understand.
3 rooms have got to be cleaned, and are all of those rooms upstairs?
Yes. Then, downstairs we have a kitchen-diner, conservatory, and lounge.
The kitchen-diner is quite large and has the usual equipment:
cooker with oven, refrigerator, cupboards, and worktops.
The conservatory has a lot of plants, but there's no need to take care of them.
The lounge has a leather three-piece suite and a large coffee table.
Thank you. And do you keep any pets?
Yeah, I really love keeping them.
I've got 2 dogs and 3 cats.
OK, then if our staff come over to offer the service, please take your pets away.
Have you looked at our service packages?
Yes, I have one in front of me.
Excellent.
Any extra services you need,
switching bed linen, working in the garden, cleaning the glass in the conservatory, that kind of thing?
Err... no... err...
actually, replacing the bed linen...
yeah.. that would be good.
No problem. I'll just make a note of that.
How about curtains, mats, and carpets?
What would you like us to do with those items?
The curtains... I'll have to think about that.
I think we should have the carpets cleaned really well every quarter.
Mats can just be done with the laundry.
Of course.
How about clothes?
We can have our staff wash and iron them,
or we can have them taken to a dry cleaner.
Washing and ironing. No, just ironing. That'll be OK.
OK, fine. I know quite a bit about what you want now.
I should let you know that we are located on 12 Amyes Road,
that's A-M-Y-E-S.
And we work on from Monday to Sunday except Tuesday and Wednesday.
Could you let me know when is convenient for you?
Next Friday...
err... no, oh, that's no good.
My son invites his friends over in the afternoon that day.
Perhaps next Thursday or next Saturday.
Let me check, OK, next Thursday.
When is it convenient for us to come over and provide the service?
Is it OK if we come in the morning?
Or we may come in the afternoon? It depends on your schedule.
I'm OK with any time.
Just give me a call to let me know you're coming before you arrive.
Sure, we will.
By the way, how long will it take for the service?
We usually work 1 to 3 hours for house cleaning,
and the work will take 3 hours at most.
And of course, if it takes more than 3 hours, you should pay extra for it.
Er... fine.

1315,IELTS Recent Actual Test 34 - Part 2,B2,ielts-recent-actual-test-34---part-2,77,"Hi everyone, and welcome to Sydney Airport.
Today, I'll be giving you the inside information on the day-to-day operations of the Australian Quarantine Service here.
We hope to provide you with a better understanding of why such heavy security regulations are necessary
by educating you on how we operate and why we do the things we do.
We're not here to try to persuade you to fly through Sydney Airport,
though we hope you'll find your experience relatively stress-free and comfortable.
First things first, our personnel.
Can anyone guess how many people work at Sydney Airport?
We have 200 alone working in Terminal 2,
so can you guess how many in the whole airport?
I heard someone say 360, that's getting closer...
What?
Did someone say 2,000?
That's way too high.
Sydney Airport actually employs 440 people.
A lot, right?
And about half of those employees work in security-related matters.
Moving on to our not-so-human employees,
let's come and see our favourite pooch, Milton.
Milton is our best drug-sniffing dog on the force.
He's friendly to most people - you can even come pet him at the end of our tour.
Burnouts beware, though, he'll find everything.
Notice that even though there are so many of us around him, Milton stays quite calm.
This is the precise reason he was chosen for the job.
Dogs that are chosen are not predisposed to sniff out different narcotics,
that's something we teach them already.
So here's a part of the airport most people never notice - the cargo transport terminal.
This is where packages are shipped to and from.
Normally we ship around 4,400 packages per month.
In this airport alone, over 52,000 packages were shipped in and out over the past year.
We ship to and from 170 different countries.
Not bad, eh?
Probably it will go up to over 72,000 packages this year.
And despite over 100 flights in and out of here daily,
the number of lost or delayed packages is impressively low.
If you send your package through here, rest assured we'll get it where it's going.
Let's move on to the area most of us are familiar with, the passenger terminals.
In order to be allowed into this area, you must pass through security with your ticket
and if you're travelling internationally, your passport.
If you're travelling domestically, you just need a legal form of ID.
If you don't have those, you will not be allowed to pass through security and board your flight.
During the security scan,
your carry-on items will be checked for dangerous items such as weapons,
sharp objects, and liquids that exceed our specified limit.
If you attempt to pass any of the prohibited items on this list posted at the entrance,
you are still allowed to board the plane,
but you'll be given a warning and your item will be confiscated.
Don't worry, we will not arrest you for having too much shampoo in your bag, or anything like that.
We also search your carry-ons and parcels for any perishable items.
We prohibit the transportation of local vegetation
and prohibit parcels containing any insects in them.
You may or may not have learned about this in Biology class,
but when some plants are introduced to a new environment,
they spread wildly and wipe out the current species around it.
It is important to control the introduction of new plants into an ecosystem,
so we must prohibit the transport of any fertile seeds.
So what happens to parcels containing possibly suspicious items?
It's of course something we do not take lightly here.
If an object passes through the scanner that appears suspicious in any way,
it is separated out for manual search by a member of our trained security personnel.
If an illegal plant or simple sharp object like a pocket knife is found,
it is simply disposed of in our biohazard waste containers,
and the package itself is returned to the sender
(or passenger, if it is for a passenger flight).
More serious weapons are reported to higher authorities for investigation.
As far as parcel security, the material of the parcel is important.
For shipped goods, the most common material used (and the most widely accepted) is paper.
Make sure it is packed sturdy enough, with no rips or tears.
We've definitely had packages rip open before due to haphazard packing.
A more common problem, though, is the package labels.
When an item does not make it to the right place, this is the most common reason.
The label may not be in the right place or marked clearly enough.
If you're receiving any items from abroad that must be declared,
please remember our guidelines in order to ensure the timely delivery of your item.
Make sure it is packed correctly,
and we ask that you notify customs between 2 and 10 days within the item's scheduled arrival date.
Okay, before we move on, are there any questions?

I'll show you around today and explain how to use these facilities.
Hopefully when I'm done with it, you'll know the ropes,
and please feel free to let me know of any questions or concerns that you may have.
Now, we're at the gate of the library.
Upon entering into the door, you'll find that the restrooms are on your left-hand side,
and opposite them is a Photocopy Room.
Many of you are wondering about the check-in and check-out process.
What you have to do is go to the Circulation Desk,
which is to the east of the Photocopy Room.
The Reading Room is a really large area in the centre of the library,
just to the north of the Circulation Desk.
I'm sure you won't miss it.
If you're here to do research, this is where you should bring books to look through.
However, if you're here to do any group projects or other interactive activities,
I advise you to use one of the study rooms,
which are just to the east of the Reading Room.
Moving on to the southeast corner,
we have the Periodicals Section, just next to the study rooms.
We have a collection of different newspapers and magazines in this section.
You can get last week's weather reports, or all the top stories 5 years ago,
our periodicals can be traced back 20 years to the time when our school library was built.
Ah, our first question! Yes?
Can we check out magazines from the library?
I'm sorry, but you cannot take any periodicals out of the library.
You're welcome to read them for as long as you want while you're here,
but you cannot check them out.
I wonder if there is any place where we can get some food in the library.
Do we have a store here?
Of course.
The Food Service Centre is just metres away from the study rooms.
It's on the northeast corner as you look at the map.
The Food Service Centre offers different kinds of snacks though it's not big.
Well, moving on along to the west,
you will find the Video Resource Centre on your right hand.
We have educational videos and documentaries, as well as major motion pictures.
We ask that you pay attention to the tag on the video that you pick up,
as many of our documentaries are for on-site viewing only and may not be taken out of the library.
To the west of the Video Resource Centre is our Satellite TV Station.
Here we stream the news from Channel 19 for most of the day.
How many channels does it have?
It does have nearly 200 channels,
but we generally will give top priority to channels with some big events,
like presidential addresses or other breaking news.
During the coverage of the presidential debate,
students will take a break from studying and flock to watch it.
Last but perhaps most important is the Enquiry Desk.
It's just on the left-hand side when you walk into the library,
so it's impossible to miss it.
If you have any questions about how to use equipment or where to find something, come and ask the assistant.
Don't be shy, because that's what they're here for!
Speaking of questions,
one of the questions we get asked is how to actually check out a book once a student has picked one out.
If it's a fiction or non-fiction book,
look for the pink and yellow check-out card inside the back cover of the book.
You can also find information about the book on these cards,
including its publishing date, genre, ISBN, and a log of dates it's been checked out before.
Present this card to me or any library assistant,
and we'll stamp it and then the book can be kept for 3 weeks.
You can find general information on a field of study by using one of our subject guides.
We have them on paper here, but any of our computers will allow you to search within fields as well.
What if the library doesn't have a resource we're looking for?
Great question, I'm going to address that.
Our library is a network with a number of other universities in the area,
so if there is something you're looking for and it's available somewhere in the area,
we'll be able to get it for you.
However, there are universities which are not part of the network,
so we do not share resources with them.
If you want more information about the library and its resources,
you'll find it in a labelled blue folder on my desk in the enquiry section.
Okay, so that's a lot of information all at once,
and I don't expect you to remember it all.
The most important thing is, please be respectful of the staff
and if you need help with anything at all, come and ask me or one of the assistants.
Alright, any questions?

1317,IELTS Recent Actual Test 34 - Part 4,C1,ielts-recent-actual-test-34---part-4,81,"Good morning.
Today, we will continue our study of Crocodylus niloticus by talking about its living habits.
We've already discussed the evolutionary attributes that set it apart from its crocodile relatives.
Does everyone remember that?
Yes, it has an extremely narrow snout, and 3 or 4 rows of protective scales on its back,
as compared to 2 rows on other members of the Crocodylus genus.
Let's take a look at how these carnivorous man-eaters live,
where they live, and finally, whether they really deserve their vicious reputation.
To start, I'd like to address a great question posed to me by a student during yesterday's office hours.
We talked about the distribution of crocodiles in Africa
and saw that they are highly concentrated in the South and West of the continent.
This student noticed that on the map displaying the distribution of crocodiles across Africa,
there were no crocodiles in the Northern Region,
and found no mention in the literature of the existence of crocodiles in the North of Africa.
Why might there be no crocodiles in North Africa?
Let's save this question for later in the lecture.
To find out more about the social habits of the African crocodile,
one researcher named Tara Shine of the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland
conducted a survey of the wetlands in Mauritania
and received reports of 46 crocodiles living in one group,
or float as we say when referring to crocodiles,
though the usual number is a little less than half of that.
In general, crocodiles are more highly concentrated in wet, subtropical environments
near bodies of water and rich vegetation.
While South American crocodiles thrive in cool rainforests,
the African crocodile is more equipped for heat.
Though they can survive at the hot temperatures found in some deserts,
they're not equipped to handle dry climates
and thus cannot survive in places like the Sahara Desert of North Africa.
As cold-blooded animals,
crocodiles' core temperatures fluctuate from their average of 38 degrees Celsius as external conditions change,
thus they need to avoid extreme temperatures.
Others live an underwater life, keeping a body temperature close to that of the water.
As their own unique method of regulating their body temperatures,
some African crocodiles have made dens
by digging holes in the ground to provide themselves with a cool, dark place to retreat from the hot African sun.
Speaking of the hot African sun,
let's go back to the question asked at the beginning of the lecture.
We know that there used to be crocodiles in Northern Africa, yet today there are none.
What are some possible explanations for this?
Some students have suggested that the African crocodile has evolved
from a desert creature into a wetland creature,
thus causing them to migrate south for more appropriate conditions.
Others presume the crocodile was hunted out of Northern Africa by a fiercer predator.
While these are intelligent guesses, the real story is a little bit different.
The key to this migration is that the Sahara Desert did not always cover the North of Africa.
About 8,000 years ago, the land was fertile wetlands perfect for breeding crocodiles.
Over time, though, the area dried out and the wetland slowly turned to desert,
leading the African crocodile to migrate south to the marshlands they call home today.
Some crocodiles did, however, adapt to living in dry conditions.
In Mauritania, some crocodiles have learned to survive in an area where they can go up to 8 months with no water
by spending the driest of times in what's called a torpor, or short period of hibernation.
To utilise every bit of rainfall,
these desert crocodiles dig underground caves that collect runoff,
thus staying cool and hydrated.
During the mating period in November and December,
males attract females to their viciously protected territory through a number of behaviours
that range from snapping their jaws all the way to sending infrasonic pulses through the water.
Afterwards, the female digs a hole up to 60 centimetres in depth
to store the eggs for an 80-day incubation period.
The female protects these eggs during the period,
and sometimes even helps crack the eggs with her snout at the end.
These teeth-gnashing carnivores are softer than we think.
Although these vicious creatures have attacked humans on a few occasions,
the residents are not afraid of them.
In fact, they show a great deal of reverence towards these wondrous creatures.
Some say that crocodiles bring water to their habitat,
so if they leave, they will bring the water with them.
Obviously this is not true,
but it demonstrates the admiration the inhabiting people have for crocodiles.
Generally, crocodiles do not predate on humans.
They attack when humans populate the crocodiles' habitat,
instilling fear and uneasiness in the crocs.
Like any other species, crocodiles are known to attack when feeling fear.
There's still a lot more to be discovered about the African crocodile.
Researchers want to know more about the population size,
how many crocodiles inhabit Africa in all,
how they form separate floats, etc.
There is still also much to learn about migration patterns,
and relations to other populations of crocodiles now found in other parts of the world.
Next time, we'll examine a few specific case studies of crocodile populations in Southern Africa.

1318,TOEFL Conversation 1,B1,toefl-conversation-1,48,"Now, then, Mr., uh, Vickstad. How can I help you?
Well, I'm thinking about transferring, but I'm, I'm not sure...
I was hoping you could help me make a decision.
I'll try.
Where are you thinking of transferring to? And why do you want to leave Kryptos U?
Um... I'm thinking of going to Central University, because it's in my hometown.
I've uh, been kind of homesick this year, and I haven't made many friends...
I just feel so lonely.
So, I thought that uh, maybe, it'd be better to be closer to my parents and friends and all.
I see.
And would you keep the same major if you transferred?
What is it... business administration?
Yeah, I would.
The credits I've earned here will transfer to Central.
I've already checked.
May I ask why you chose to come to Kryptos University in the first place?
Sure.
Um, well, the main reason is you have a great business school.
And the second reason is that I... I wanted to get away from home.
You're right, Mr. Vickstad, we do have an excellent business school.
But, so does Central.
The thing is, you've got almost a year under your belt here now.
At Central, you'll be starting from scratch.
Yeah, I know that. But I'm a little bit familiar with Central, 'cuz I had older friends who went there,
and I visited it before I came here.
You know, freshman year is usually the hardest.
I remember how homesick I was my first year.
I'll tell you, I was ready to pack it in after the first two weeks.
But the longer I stayed, the more comfortable I felt.
By senior year, I was glad I chose to stay.
Really? Did it get a lot better your sophomore year?
Yes, it did. You might well find the same is true for you.
Also, even though your credits here will transfer,
you will have to take extra courses,
because Central has different requirements.
You'll probably have to go to school for an extra year.
Hmm... I hadn't thought about that.
I'll have to check into it.
Maybe I should give it one more year.
I mean, it's probably good for me to learn to live away from my family and friends, right?
It'll make me stronger in the future.
You can always move back there after you graduate.
Of course, by that time you may not want to!
Thank you for all your help.
I guess I'll find out the exact transfer requirements.
You've given me a lot to think about.
Don't mention it.
If you feel like you wanna talk more, don't hesitate to come back and see me.

1319,TOEFL Lecture 1,B2,toefl-lecture-1,63,"You've been reading about animal behavior.
Today we'll discuss one of the most astonishing behaviors in the animal world: dancing bees.
Did you know that bees can dance?
Well, neither did scientists, until the 1960s.
That's when a German scientist, named, uh, Karl von Frisch,
noticed something truly remarkable.
As he was observing honeybees,
he noticed that some of the bees, which he called scout bees,
flew out of the hive to look for food.
When a scout found a site where there was food,
it flew back to the beehive and started dancing.
This dance somehow told the other honeybees where the food was,
because after the dance, the bees... some of the bees flew from the hive straight to the site of the food.
Von Frisch called the bees that collect the food forager bees.
He thought the scout bee's dance told the forager bees three things:
first, the smell of the food it had found;
second, which direction to fly to reach the food;
and third, the distance of the food site from the beehive.
Von Frisch won the 1973 Nobel Prize for this discovery,
but many scientists were skeptical of his theory.
They didn't believe it was the dance that led the forager bees to food.
Instead, they thought it might be, oh, the smell of the food on the dancing bee,
or maybe that they just followed the scout back to the food site.
Well, very recently, some British scientists used a new type of radar
to prove that von Frisch's theory was indeed correct.
It is the dance that communicates this information to other bees.
British researchers found that the scout bees perform two types of dances.
If the food is near the hive, say, oh, about 50 or 60 meters away,
the scout flies in a round pattern, like a circle.
This tells the location, but not the direction, of the food site.
If the site is farther away,
the scout does what's called a waggle dance.
It flies in a pattern of ovals and vertical lines.
The speed of the waggle dance tells other bees how far away the food site is.
The slower the dance, the farther away the food.
If the scout flies in a vertical line up the side of the beehive,
it's telling the foragers to fly directly toward the sun.
If the scout flies vertically down the hive, it's saying, ""fly away from the sun"".
Up is toward, down is away.
If the scout flies at an angle to the hive,
it's telling the foragers to fly neither toward nor away from the sun, but in between.
The bees have a special internal mechanism to know which angle they should fly,
based on the sun, the hive and the food site.
They can also measure the distance they fly by recording the motion of things they see as they fly past.
Now, um, one problem with von Frisch's theory had been this:
It seems to take the forager bees a long time to reach the food site.
That's why scientists thought that perhaps it wasn't the waggle dance that led them there.
For many years, scientists couldn't follow the foragers after they left the hive
because they didn't have the technology.
Just a few years ago, though,
the British scientists solved this problem using a new type of radar.
They were able to attach a... a small radio transmitter to forager bees,
I don't know how, but they did.
This enabled them to follow the forager bees' flight after they left the hive.
The radar showed that foragers, do, in fact, fly straight to the area of the food site.
They don't follow the scout bee back to the site,
because the scout goes into the hive after it finishes dancing.
Well then, if the waggle dance does lead the foragers directly to the food site,
why does it take so long for them to find the actual food?
The answer is that the waggle dance leads the foragers only to the general area of the food.
It doesn't tell them the exact location of the flowers or plants that have the food.
So the foragers have to spend a while flying around the area
before they find the exact location of what they're looking for.

1320,TOEFL Conversation 2,B2,toefl-conversation-2,87,"Morning, Myra.
Oh hi, Arthur!
You're taking Ecology Three Eleven too?
Looks like it. It's my only elective this term.
Really? What happened?
Oh, I just took too many my second year,
and now I've got to pick up all the required courses I've been ignoring.
University's just too much fun, I guess.
Too many parties?
No. Well, yeah, that too.
But you know, there're just so many interesting things to learn about,
and we've only got four years here to explore them.
I've been having too good a time at it, that's all.
But it has helped me decide my major, finally.
And?
Business Ad.
I've learned a lot here,
and one thing I've learned is that most fields don't hold out a lot of promise for gainful employment!
So I'm playing it safe and going for my BA in business administration.
So, why Three Eleven?
An ecology course isn't going to help you in your office job at some corporation.
Probably not, but it still seems interesting and important.
We all need to know about the environment, no matter what we do for a living.
Yeah, you're right. And maybe you will be able to use it.
Maybe you'll end up working for a green company or something.
Could be. There's more and more of those every day.
And thank goodness. Poor old Earth!
Is that why you're taking this?
Well, it's not an elective for me.
I need Three Eleven for my BS program.
We need several cross-field courses to ""broaden our understanding"",
and this is one of them.
Actually, though, I'm looking forward to this course:
""Nature's Influence on Man - Man's Influence on Nature""!
Sounds like a really useful topic, doesn't it?
And Dr Forsythe is supposed to be a very engaging lecturer.
Well, his website is a gas, at least!
He's got a hilarious little eco-game on it:
shoot the wolves and see how many deer reproduce and eat all the grass!
Hmm. I suppose that would teach, uh, fifth graders about the balance of nature.
Hey, it was fun!
Anyway, he's also got some good information there,
it'll probably come in handy when he gives us homework.
Wow, you're right!
I better take a look at it myself.
Can you give me his URL?
It's listed right in the course guide where they describe the course,
but if you can't find it, I'll give it to you next time.
Or I could email it to you,
what's your address?
That would be great, thanks.
myrasweetie@umail.com
Here, I'll write it down for you.
Did you pick up your textbook yet?
No. I've been looking for a secondhand copy before I spring for a new one.
It's expensive - forty-five bucks!
They all are, aren't they?
Why do poor college students have to pay so much for their textbooks?
It ain't fair.
It's just economics.
Nobody reads them except the students that take the courses.
The publishers probably didn't print more than a few hundred copies of our text, you know.
Still, they could print them in paperback, couldn't they?
That would save us some money.
And on newsprint, sure!
Some students do keep them, though, for reference after they graduate,
if they're working in that field.
In that case, they need to be durable.
My dad's still got his college accounting textbooks,
and he uses them all the time.
I suppose you're right.
Where you gonna find a used copy?
At the bookstore?
They don't have any there now, I checked.
I put up some notes on the Science Building bulletin boards yesterday.
Maybe someone there's got one they don't want to keep anymore.
Well, uh, if you hear about two of them, will you let me know?
I'd like to save a little money, too.
Sure.
If I do, I'll buy it for you and you can pay me back.
How much are you willing to pay?
Oh, anything under $35 will be fine.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
But if you haven't found one by next Monday, I'll have to buy a new one then,
so email me Sunday night either way, will you?
You bet.
Oops! Here's Dr Forsythe now.

1321,TOEFL Lecture 2,B1,toefl-lecture-2,85,"Today we're going to begin with a short quiz.
No, no, you don't need pencil and paper, just listen.
It's only one question.
Ready? OK.
What do blogs, Pokemon, tattoos, Cabbage Patch Kids, pet rocks, and hula hoops have in common?
Anybody?
They're all stupid.
I know, Professor Morgan. They're all fads.
Correct.
Now here's another question:
How did you know that?
In other words, what are the characteristics of a fad,
and what's the difference between a fad and a trend?
These are the questions we're going to consider together this afternoon.
Well, the main difference, I think, between a fad and a trend concerns time.
A fad is something that seems to appear suddenly.
It quickly becomes enormously popular,
then disappears just as suddenly as it came.
A trend also appears rather suddenly,
and it also becomes very popular,
but it doesn't disappear.
A trend can have a long-term influence on its particular market.
Fads and trends often resemble each other at first glance,
but a fad usually has a definite beginning and end.
Um, Pokemon might be a fad,
but the idea of fancy playing cards for children might be a trend, for example.
Another difference is that fads usually stay within one industry.
Trends can cross over into many industries.
The hula hoop, for instance, has been called the greatest fad of all time.
25 million...
In the late 1950s, 25 million hula hoops were sold in just four months.
But a year later, sales had virtually stopped.
The hula hoop was a toy.
It was fun to play with, but that's about all.
Now consider cell phones.
They were designed to be portable telephones,
but they crossed over into the worlds of fashion,
wireless communication, and now even photography.
People buy cell phones that match the latest clothes fashions.
They use cell phones for wireless Internet access.
They take photos with them.
Cell phones have become a trend.
Here's the third difference between fads and trends:
how well industries accept them.
Fads are often promoted by smaller companies.
They need the quick money that fads provide.
Large companies don't accept fads right away.
They can't afford to be wrong.
If a company is known as a trend-setter,
and it promotes a fad, its reputation will be damaged.
Large companies buy products in huge numbers.
They don't want unsold products sitting on their shelves.
So they wait to see if a fad becomes a trend.
Then they will accept it in their stores.
Now... yes?
How long does a fad have to last before it becomes a trend?
I mean, there are all these energy drinks now.
There used to be only a couple, but now there's like, a hundred.
Are they still a fad?
Exercise is a trend, so wouldn't energy drinks be part of the exercise trend?
That's an excellent question!
When exactly does a fad become a trend?
You know, there are some people who are paid a lot of money to answer that question.
If they get it right, companies become rich and famous.
If they get it wrong, companies go bankrupt and careers get ruined.
The short answer is: nobody knows.
Distinguishing between fads and trends is an art, not a science.
If it were easy, there would be a lot more rich people in the world.
Yes, in the back.
Yeah, um... can't people get rich from fads, too?
You said they sold 25 million hula hoops in four months.
Someone must have made big money off that?
Yes, they did.
Toy companies made, uh, $45 million off of hula hoops by the time the fad ended.
And maybe some of you have heard of pet rocks, in the 1970s?
A man bought a rock for a penny,
put it in a gift box and marketed it as a pet.
He became an instant millionaire.
But the problem... the trouble with fads is,
no one can predict them.
This man had no idea that so many people would buy rocks as pets.
He started it as kind of a joke.
The Pokemon creators had no clue their cards would become instantly popular all over the world.
That's the thing.
Fads are mysterious to both their creators and to the public.

1322,TOEFL Conversation 3,B2,toefl-conversation-3,84,"Good morning, Hanna. Thanks for coming in.
How was your holiday?
It was very good, Professor, thanks.
A week in the Appalachians is really therapeutic.
Nothing to do but eat, sleep, and listen to nature.
It's beautiful up there in the spring,
the countryside is so green,
and the people are so friendly and laid back.
A good place to unwind.
I envy you.
I've just got too much to get done to get away at all now.
I must get this book finished,
for one thing, my publisher's getting impatient.
I've outlined the last two chapters, though, finally,
so it won't take me too much longer, I hope.
Maybe I'll be able to go somewhere at Christmas.
But, um, what I wanted to talk to you about is our syllabus for this term, Hanna.
I know this is short notice,
but I'd like to make a couple of little changes to it.
Uh oh! I know your idea of ""little"" changes!
No, no, I don't think it'll be that bad this time.
What I'd like to do is, uh, cut Lectures Two and Three,
the ones on Old English and Middle English,
down to half their length and then meld them together into a single lecture.
Then, with that extra ninety minutes,
I want to add a lecture at the end on World Englishes.
I think it's time we dealt with that more thoroughly, don't you?
Yes sir, I certainly do. That's a good idea.
So I guess I just need to cut down the quizzes to match
and add a new one for World Englishes.
Do you know when I'll be able to see your revised OE and ME notes?
I've already done a good bit of that revision, Hanna,
and I think I'll have them ready for you before Lecture One.
That's April 8th, I think?
Yes, Tuesday the eighth.
I've taken the segments on pronunciation out,
I think we can lose those easily enough.
Nobody really needs to recite ""Beowulf"" or the ""Canterbury Tales"" any more,
no matter how much fun it is.
And that means you probably won't be discussing orthography much either?
I suppose not.
I just want to be sure to point out clearly the main ways in which Modern English has developed from its predecessors.
You know, the Great Vowel Shift, and so forth.
Saving ninety minutes is not going to commit Old and Middle English to total oblivion, after all.
Not if you can help it, certainly!
So I can eliminate the phonetics quiz completely, then?
Yes, I think so.
I'll still give them a reading so they can get a flavour of their ancestral tongue,
but they can get as much of the phonetics as they want out of the textbook,
and it's rote learning anyway, really.
Now, what about your new lecture, then?
Can I get started on any of that?
Yes, that's where I could really use your help in the next couple of weeks.
I need you to research 'pidgins and creoles' for me.
I've never paid enough attention to them,
and I'd like an idea of the number there are,
their distribution, and uh, what linguists are saying about them these days,
are they English dialects? Derivative languages? What?
See if you can find some interesting examples and some specific quotes, will you?
Yes, of course.
I think I know the kind of thing you're looking for.
I'll take a look for internet sources this afternoon and then see what the library has later.
Thank you, Hanna, I'd appreciate that.
And while you're there,
would you see if they've got a copy of Burnley's source book on the history of English?
I can't seem to find mine.
Oh. Uh... that's because you lent it to me last term...
and erm, I haven't returned it yet.
Ah. Well. Get it back to me sometime soon, then, will you?
I need to refer to it for my revisions.
Yes sir, of course.
Anything else on the syllabus?
Just that we'll need the student handout revised to reflect the changes.
Who was in charge of that last time?
The department secretary has the file.
I'll draft a revision, let you check it, and then give it to her, shall I?
Shouldn't take long, and we just need to get photocopies before the first class.
All right, I'll leave that in your hands too then, Hanna.
Just let me know if you need anything.
And I'll see you at the faculty meeting tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, yes. Yes. The faculty meeting.
Oh, and if you need any anecdotes on Appalachian English dialect,
I'm your girl, I've just picked up a wealth of contemporary examples!
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Hanna.

1323,TOEFL Lecture 3,B2,toefl-lecture-3,83,"Hello again.
Well, we're near the end of our unit on newspapers.
I'm going to talk about our national paper, USA Today.
Some of you might recognize it as the topic of this week's reading assignment.
US... USA Today is now more than 25 years old.
When it began, few expected it would last this long.
Well, not only has it lasted, it has thrived.
USA Today is the largest-selling daily newspaper in America.
It is also distributed in many countries around the world.
But that's only part of the story.
The real success of USA Today is the way it changed the newspaper industry.
USA Today changed the way papers look.
It changed the way reporters write.
And it changed the way papers gather and deliver news.
USA Today set out to be different.
Newspapers at that time were, um, in trouble.
Fewer people were reading them.
The papers were full of bad news about crime and killing.
They had long stories.
They didn't have color photos and graphics
and many could not include the latest sports scores.
USA Today changed all that.
It had shorter stories,
most of which did not jump, or continue, from one page to another.
It used color photos, and colorful charts and graphics.
It did not have much international news,
but it did have lots of sports, entertainment and human-interest stories.
It was trying to appeal to younger readers.
These readers had been raised watching television,
so they had trouble, uh, paying attention to longer stories.
They wanted, erm, to be entertained, not informed.
At first, many people laughed at USA Today.
Other newspapers called it ""McPaper"".
They were comparing it to McDonald's fast food, which isn't, um, very healthy.
It fills you up, but it doesn't have much nutrition.
They said McPaper was the same way,
it looked good, but the news it had wasn't very important.
People said USA Today ""dumbed down"" the news.
Does anyone know what ""dumb down"" means?
Yeah, I think it means to make things too simple.
Like, you want to make it easy to understand, but you make it too easy.
So it's like writing for a little child.
That's exactly right.
If you make something too simple, people get mad.
They think that the writer thinks they're stupid.
But a funny thing happened.
More and more people started reading USA Today.
About a year after it started, it had a circulation of more than one million.
Today, its circulation is past two million.
Question?
Yo, what does circulation mean?
Circulation is the number of papers that are read each day.
It means that USA Today distributes more than two million copies of each issue.
When other papers saw the circulation grow, they became worried.
So, they started to, uh, copy USA Today's style.
Their stories got shorter, and they started using lots of color photos and charts.
They replaced quote unquote serious news with feature stories.
Soon, it became normal for newspapers to look like USA Today.
But it wasn't only appearance that made USA Today so popular.
One very big reason for its success was timeliness.
Timeliness means its ability to report the latest news.
Daily newspapers have a deadline,
which is the time they have to stop writing and start printing the paper.
The deadline often caused papers to leave out news.
This was especially true of East Coast papers and, erm, West Coast sports scores.
Basketball, football and baseball games would end on the West Coast at 11 p.m.
But that's 2 p.m Eastern time.
This was too late to put the score of the game in the next day's paper.
USA Today, however, used satellites to transmit news.
It could set later deadlines, so it could include the West Coast scores.
This, alone, caused many people to buy the paper.
Yes?
But today most papers use satellites.
So why has USA Today's circulation kept growing?
Excellent question.
Uh, actually, USA Today has changed.
It still looks colorful, but it's started to become more like traditional papers.
Its stories are getting longer, and it has more international news.
It changed because people are changing.
The paper needed to appeal to more, um, educated readers,
because they're the ones with money.
Also, it needed to sell more papers overseas.
International readers don't want ""dumbed down"" news.

Sure. I need to see your student ID card, please.
OK, thank you.
Now, which type of IMA pass would you like to buy?
Um, I don't know. How many different kinds of passes are there?
Well, there's a basic pass.
That allows you to use the basketball courts, the fitness center,
the racquetball courts, the rock-climbing center, and the indoor track.
An IMA super pass lets you use all those things,
and also the swimming pools, tennis courts, and golf driving range.
Then we have, um, specialized passes for just the swimming pools and the fitness center.
Man, I didn't know this was going to be so complicated.
Um, so the basic pass includes basketball, the fitness center, racquetball, and, uh, what else?
The rock-climbing center and the indoor track.
It costs $50 for the quarter.
And the Super Pass has all those things,
plus swimming, tennis, and the golf driving range, right?
Yes, that's correct.
The super pass is $75 for the quarter.
It also permits you to use the IMA Center during the two-week Christmas vacation,
if you're going to be here.
So, the basic pass is $50 for the quarter,
and the super pass is, uh, 75,
but the super pass it gives you two extra weeks.
And um, you mentioned there were also special passes?
Yes, we have a swim-only pass for $35.
This lets you use either one of our two swimming pools,
plus the sauna and whirlpools in the locker room.
There's also a pass for the fitness center only.
It costs $40, and gives you access to all the weight machines and fitness machines,
as well as the locker room sauna and whirlpools.
All right, let's see if I've got this straight.
The swim pass is $35, and the fitness center pass is $40.
And both of these include access to the whirlpools and saunas in the locker room?
Correct.
Oh, and one other thing I forgot to mention
is that the fitness pass includes a 15% discount on all of our IMA sports and fitness classes.
What kinds of sports and fitness classes do you have?
Oh, my! We have several different kinds of dance classes, yoga, aerobics, swim conditioning, Tae Kwon Do....
Here's a brochure with all the details.
Thanks.
So, these classes, there's an extra fee for them, even if I have a super pass?
I'm afraid so, because we have to pay the teachers' salaries and the cost of equipment.
OK.
Uh, oh yeah, what about someone who isn't a university student?
Is there some kind of pass they could buy?
No, I'm afraid not.
IMA passes are only offered to registered students and faculty.
Guests have to be accompanied by a student or faculty member.
They pay $10 each time they come.
Can students pay the same way, I mean, each time they come?
Yes, but if you're going to come very often it's better to buy a pass.
The student price is $5 per visit.
If you use the IMA even once a week, you'll save money buying a pass.
Well, thanks for all the information.
There are so many choices, I can't make a decision right now.
I'll think about it, then come back later in the week.
No problem.
We're open Monday through Thursday from 8 to 12,
then 1 to 4:30, and from 1 to 5:30 on Friday.

1325,TOEFL Lecture 4,C1,toefl-lecture-4,81,"You've been reading this month about food chains and food webs.
Today we'll discuss these in relation to seafood.
How many of you like seafood?
Mmm, most of you.
So do I.
In fact, I'm on a seafood diet.
I see food, I eat it.
Haha, get it? OK.
But seriously folks...
Today we're going to talk about trophic relationships in marine food chains and webs.
Who can remind us what a trophic relationship is?
Yes, Ms. Li.
It's what an organism eats, and uh, the things that eat that organism.
Very good.
Trophic relationships describe the relationship between producers and consumers,
so they help us diagram food chains and food webs.
Now, in marine ecosystems, like other ecosystems,
food is needed for matter - growth and reproduction,
and for energy - metabolic processes within the body.
Also like other ecosystems,
marine ecosystems have producers, consumers and decomposers.
The primary producers are autotrophic plankton.
Auto trophic means these plankton can synthesize their own food.
Autotrophs are consumed by heterotrophic organisms.
""Hetero"" means other;
so in this case, heterotrophic means organisms that can't synthesize their own food.
They must rely on autotrophs for food energy.
The primary consumers in marine food chains are the plant eaters - herbivores,
and the secondary consumers are both the meat eaters - carnivores - and predators
that eat both meat and plants - omnivores.
The decomposers are heterotrophic bacteria,
which get energy from body wastes and dead tissue,
thus cycling it back to the producers.
A simple marine food chain, then, might look like this:
the top predator,
trophic level number 4, is a herring.
Herring fish eat level 3, carnivorous zooplankton.
The carnivorous zooplankton eat trophic level 2, herbivorous zooplankton.
And herbivorous zooplankton eat level number 1, phytoplankton, which is a type of autotroph.
In marine food chains, energy transfer is not very efficient.
Phytoplankton utilize only about one percent of the energy available from the sun.
Between 70 and 90 percent of the energy made by producers or eaten by heterotrophs
is used in their bodies or expelled as waste.
This leaves only 10 to 30 percent that is retained in the body's biomass
and available for consumers at the next highest trophic level.
Thus, the biomass at each trophic level is controlled by the efficiency of the energy transfer.
At the lowest trophic level,
animals will generally have high biomass,
and there will be lots of small producers.
At the highest trophic level,
animals will generally have low biomass,
and there will be only a few large animals.
Now, let's expand our simple food chain into a food web.
In this web, a herring is no longer a trophic-4 predator.
There is a bigger fish, um... a tuna, that eats the herring.
But there's even a bigger animal that eats the tuna. And that is...?
Us!
Yes. And there's something else from the seas that will even eat us.
Sharks!
Correct.
A food web is more complex than a food chain.
And then there are gigantic animals, like whale sharks and baleen whales,
that are herbivores and only eat plankton.
But let's focus for a few moments on us.
What are the implications of trophic levels for the fish we eat?
Well, looking at the fish harvest worldwide,
88% of the fish we catch are fish with fins.
8% are shellfish,
and 4% are crustaceans.
Fish caught in the open ocean, such as tuna,
are high-level predators on an inefficient food chain.
Fish caught in coastal waters, such as cod, herring and haddock,
are at the top end of shorter, more efficient food chains.
This is because there is a high level of phytoplankton,
so consumers expend less energy catching food.
These fish, then, provide more energy and better nutrition for us.
In ""upswelling"" areas, off the west coasts of America and Africa,
the fish are even healthier.
Here they are small, very efficient food chains,
and the fish are small, fast-growing, eat lots of phytoplankton and travel in dense schools.
Two examples of such fish are anchovies and sardines.

1326,TOEFL Conversation 5,B2,toefl-conversation-5,64,"Good afternoon, Ms. Pennington.
You are in my, um, American History 201 class, right?
How can I help you today?
It's about my term paper.
I, uh, I know it's due next Monday, but, um, I was hoping...
I don't think I can get it done by then.
Could I please turn it in by the end of next week instead?
I have a really good excuse.
Oh I'm sure you do!
I've been teaching 33 years.
Do you know how many excuses I've heard?
""My dog ate my paper"".
""My roommate had a party so I couldn't concentrate"".
""I have seven papers due in the same day!"".
""I went home to see my parents and my car broke down"".
My favorite was a student who told me she ""forgot"" all about her term paper until the day before it was due.
It's amazing she remembered to come to class.
Huh, I didn't forget, sir.
I've been working on the paper, really!
Here, I brought my outline and a rough draft.
It's, um, just that... well, a lot of things have been going on in my life,
and I'm having trouble managing things.
I see.
You know, I assigned that paper four weeks ago,
and I've been reminding students about it in each class.
So, tell me your story.
What's happening in your life?
First, about two weeks ago, my roommate found out her mother is real sick.
She has breast cancer.
So she's been really upset, and, uh,
I went home with her for a couple of days to see her mom.
That caused me to miss biology lab,
and I have a huge biology final coming up on Tuesday that I really need to study for this weekend.
Then I got the flu last week, and missed a day of class.
I tried to work on your paper that day, but I felt really horrible...
OK, I can understand that.
I'm glad that you're, er, helping your roommate through a tough time.
That's more important than school work.
But all this seems to have happened recently.
What about the two weeks after I first assigned the term paper?
I, uh... I guess I didn't use that time very well.
I kind of put off getting started on it.
Yes, you did.
You know, if I had a dollar for every time I've heard a student say that...
I'm sorry, Professor Dalton.
I've learned my lesson.
If I had spent just a little bit of time each week on the paper, I could have had it done on time.
I know now that I need to plan for unexpected things.
You seem like a bright, conscientious young lady, Ms...
your first name's Jill, isn't it?
When I was a young student, an upperclassman gave me some advice that I've never forgotten.
He said, ""You're going to find yourself with a lot of small gaps during school days,
15 minutes, or half an hour.
What you do during those gaps will make a big difference in how successful you are"".
Wow! That's great advice.
Yeah, I thought so. And I still do.
So I'll tell you what.
You can turn your paper in no later than 9 a.m. on Friday, right here on my office desk.
In exchange for this favor,
I want you to pass that advice on to all your friends and dorm mates.
Thank you, professor Dalton!
You bet I will.
Um, as long as you're here, let me take a peek at your outline and rough draft.
Do you have any questions about the paper that I can help you with?

1327,TOEFL Lecture 5,C1,toefl-lecture-5,67,"Many people, including scientists, are confused about the distinction between nuts and seeds.
Some dictionaries say a nut is also a seed,
others say a nut is a fruit,
and still others say a nut can be both a fruit and a seed.
How can an average person tell the difference?
Well, in a nutshell, nuts are seeds but seeds cannot be nuts.
Clear as a bell, right?
Part of the confusion stems from the fact that seeds and nuts are classified differently
for botanical purposes and culinary ones.
Botanists, that is, scientists who study plants,
define a seed as part of the, er, a flowering plant or tree that will grow into a new plant or tree
if it's, uh, buried in the ground and germinated.
In this respect it's similar to a human egg,
which becomes an embryo when fertilized by sperm.
Sometimes the plant embryo becomes enclosed in a covering, called an integument:
INTEGUMENT.
The embryo plus its integument, therefore, constitute a seed.
Um, sunflower seeds are good examples of this.
You've got to crack open the black outer part, the integument,
to eat the white embryo inside, right?
That's why we call them sunflower seeds, and not sunflower nuts.
However, it's possible for an embryo to have no type of integument at all.
As these embryos grow, the tissue surrounding them develops into a fruit.
We see this form in many berries, as well as tomatoes, and in peanuts and beans.
So an embryo, or seed, doesn't need a covering to be called a fruit.
Now, some plants produce a type of fruit called nuts.
A nut is a plant fruit containing a single seed (with or without integument)
that does not attach itself to the ovary, or, uh, inside wall of the nut.
Nuts have a dry, tough outer shell that doesn't crack open when the seed becomes mature.
Acorns, chestnuts, and walnuts are good examples of nuts.
In the botanical sense, a nut is a seed because it is a compound ovary;
it contains both the seed and the fruit of a plant.
Usually, a plant's seed can be separated from its fruit,
like when you poke seeds from a watermelon.
But with nuts, the part inside the outer shell contains both the seed and the fruit,
and these can't be pulled apart.
This inside part of the nut, the part inside the outer shell, is called a kernel.
The kernel is definitely not a nut.
It's a fruit.
People often eat the kernel, and when they do this,
they say they are eating a nut,
for example, ""I'm eating a pecan,""
or ""I'm eating a chestnut"".
What they should be saying, technically, is
""I'm eating pecan meat"" or ""I'm eating a chestnut kernel"".
In the same sense,
a peanut typically refers to the entire package of seed-slash-fruit encased in its outer shell,
as well as to the edible inner seed-slash-fruit.
So, while a nut is botanically classified as a seed,
it is primarily in this culinary sense that people confuse nuts and seeds.
Because a nut in cuisine is more, uh, loosely defined than a nut in botany,
the term ""nut"" gets slapped on many seeds that are not true nuts.
Almonds, for example, are mistakenly called nuts,
even though they actually are the edible seeds of plants called drupes,
as are coconuts and pistachio nuts.
Cashews are another example of nuts that are really seeds,
along with Brazil nuts, which are seeds that come from capsules.
In culinary language,
any kernel used in cooking that is found within a shell may be labeled as a nut.
One attribute nuts and seeds have in common is that they are both highly nutritious.
Nuts are a great source of energy because they have lots of oil,
and are also an excellent source of protein, fiber, magnesium and zinc.
Additionally, recent... recent studies have also shown they are beneficial for the blood and heart.
Many seeds are packed with vitamin E, which is touted for its anti-aging properties.
Nuts and seeds are good not only for humans, but also for wildlife,
a fact confirmed each fall when animals such as squirrels, chipmunks and jays
can be seen busily storing nuts to avoid starvation in the coming winter cold.

I'd like to buy a campus parking pass for next year.
Certainly. Did you want a limited or unlimited?
And just for fall quarter, or for the entire school year?
I was thinking of one for the whole year, but I'm not sure.
Does the year include summer quarter?
'Cause I won't be here then.
No, summer term is extra.
The year includes fall, winter and spring quarters.
A yearly pass is valid only from the start of fall term to the end of spring term.
This year, that's, uh, let's see...
September 22nd to June 7th.
Oh, OK.
And you said there were two different kinds? Uh, limited and unlimited?
Yes. A limited pass lets you park in any campus lot only on days school is in session.
During holidays and on weekends, you would have to pay the normal parking rate.
With an unlimited pass, you can park in any lot on any day during the school year,
including weekends and holidays.
Like I said, between September 22nd and June 7th.
Hmm... how much do they cost?
A limited pass is $100, and an unlimited pass is $150.
All right, I'll buy an unlimited, I guess.
What do I have to do?
First, I'm going to give you a registration form.
This gives us information about your car.
Fill it out, and bring it back to me when you're ready.
You can pay by cash, check, or credit card.
Then, I'll give you a sticker to put on the corner of your windshield.
Make sure that sticker is in place when you park.
Otherwise, you will get a ticket.
No problem.
So, um, does this pass guarantee that I'll get a parking space?
I mean, are there, like, special places set aside in each lot for people with parking passes?
That's a good question.
Uh, unfortunately, the answer is no.
Parking is on a first-come, first-serve basis.
If a lot is full, you'll have to park somewhere else,
or wait until another car leaves.
I see.
How much does, um, regular parking cost? Without a pass?
It's two dollars an hour, or $10 a day.
You're getting an excellent deal.
Thank you.

Do you need all the money up front, or can I make payments?

1329,TOEFL Lecture 6,C1,toefl-lecture-6,58,"Most scholars agree that women have been short-changed in United States history textbooks.
Because a woman has never been a, uh, US president or a commander,
a major commander, anyway, in a war,
these scholars argue that historians have, um, overlooked or ignored the contributions women have made to US history.
In recent years, though, a new view of women's history has emerged.
It's called ""women-centered history""
and it's forcing historians to re-interpret traditional pictures of key historical events.
Now they're looking at ways women contributed to history ""behind the scenes"" if you will.
For instance, though they didn't fight in wars or occupy the political stage,
women formed organizations in places such as churches and clubs,
where they discussed ideas and learned skills
that would later lead to their emergence in the historical spotlight.
Um, Jane Addams is one good example of this.
She founded houses for poor people in Chicago,
and was an original member of the American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU.
She lobbied government for the rights of workers and women,
which paid off in 1920 when women received the right to vote.
In 19... uh, 1931,
she became the first American woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
Women-centered history starts with the premise that females played an important part in shaping US history,
and that the gender is a, um, worthy historical distinction.
This perspective is different from past models of studying women in US history.
One of the first models is called the contribution approach,
which concedes that men played the leading historical roles
but demonstrates that women were vital ""supporting actresses""
at every landmark historical event.
While this was certainly true, the contribution approach has been criticized
because it highlights only the bravest and brightest women,
and it also neglects the social role of women in everyday family life.
Another... a second historical model is called the victim approach,
which emphasizes how men have oppressed women throughout history.
Um, although obviously true, it tells only part of the story.
It also tends toward emotionalism, overly dramatizing the women's plight.
Critics charge that under the victim approach,
the only women who stand out are the unusual ones,
such as the famous Salem ""witches"" of the seventeenth century.
The rest are weak, helpless victims of a male-dominated world.
Women-centered history tends to balance the contribution and victim approaches.
Instead of asking, ""How have women helped men?"" or ""how have men oppressed women?"",
it asks simply, ""What have women done?""
Now, in one sense it still gives only a partial picture,
because it examines history from only one perspective,
but in another sense it gives a fairer and more complete portrait of US women's past than the previous two models.
One historian, named Gerda Lerner,
says women-centered history tells how women have survived
and contributed in a male world ""on their own terms"".
Ms.Lerner claims that women-centered history best portrays the balance
of interaction between women's oppression and women's power.
I'm not sure about that, but I do know one thing.
It has compelled historians to see certain historical processes in a new light,
such as the, eight, or, nineteenth century temperance movement,
and the prohibition movement of the twentieth century.
As feminist scholars keep studying the history of US women,
more new approaches are likely to develop.
For example, there are still several sub-categories of women's history to consider,
such as labor history, social status, the history of women in minority cultures, and so on.
There are also class divisions, race divisions, ethnic divisions and religious divisions.
Finally, there is the history of women's interactions with other women, not just with men.

1331,TOEFL Lecture 7,C1,toefl-lecture-7,65,"Good morning. Ready to begin?
Today I'd like to complement our study of Romanticism
by examining more closely the life of Charles Fourier.
That's four like the number, then i-e-r.
But, before we study Mr. Fourier,
let's review what we know about Romanticism.
Who can tell me what Romanticism was, and when it lasted?
Yes, Mr. Stiles.
Romanticism was a cultural and, um, artistic movement in Europe.
It lasted for the first quarter of the 18th - no, I mean 19th, Century.
Very nice, Mr. Stiles.
Who would like to summarize the main message of Romanticism?
Let's see... Ms. Brown?
The main message was probably, um, that artists should, uh...
that individuals should use their imagination to choose the form and content of all art.
The Romantics thought that the Enlightenment had kind of choked off imagination,
and feeling, and creativity, and, um, like stifled all individual freedom.
Well put, Ms. Brown.
The Romantics loathed any type of rationalism.
The Enlightenment had emphasized rationality and reason so much that the Romantics felt the individual had been demolished,
reduced to an automated robot.
It was time to liberate the soul, to break away and stand out, to reclaim individual freedom.
Rousseau penned the rallying cry in the beginning of his Confessions:
""I am not made like any of those I have seen"".
""I venture to believe that I am not made like any of those who are in existence"".
""If I am not better, at least I am different"".
So then, it was against this backdrop that Charles Fourier appeared on the historical stage.
Mr. Fourier was what Karl Marx would later dub a utopian socialist.
He was one of three main utopian socialists, along with Robert Owen and Henri de Saint-Simon.
A utopian socialist, broadly speaking,
was someone who employed socialist principles to create hypothetical versions of perfect utopias -
um, societies that were egalitarian or communal, in which people would live in perfect fairness and harmony.
Utopian philosophers believed these kinds of societies could be achieved in the immediate future.
Thus they planted the first seeds of the early 20th Century socialist movement.
Monsieur Fourier was born in northeast France on April 7, 1772,
and he died in Paris on October 10, 1837.
He was widely regarded as the most utopian of the utopian socialists.
He argued vigorously, for instance, that women should have equal rights with men -
and actually coined our modern word feminism.
Also, he thought the industrial revolution that was then taking place in England was simply a passing phase;
that mankind would move beyond industrialism to something better.
As to what that something better would be, Fourier had some rather unusual ideas.
He was born into a well-to-do family of cloth merchants,
and after he inherited his mother's estate in 1812,
he had the money and time to pursue these notions.
In his four published works,
Fourier laid out a vision of a future community built on emotional bonds,
fueled by what he called the laws of ""passional attraction"".
Basic human passions and drives had been repressed for too long, he argued.
Now these emotions needed to be openly expressed and harnessed.
Men and women would live in self-contained housing units with 1,620 members.
Why 1,620?
Because Mr. Fourier had determined that people could be classified into 810 different psychological types.
If you multiply this by two, for men and women, you get 1,620.
With such precise pairing, he was certain that the laws of passional attraction would produce ideal, harmonious relationships.
Many of Fourier's ideas, to be frank, were perfect nonsense.
He projected that his new world would last for 80,000 years,
the last 8,000 of these in an era of perfect harmony.
In this period he predicted, among other things,
that six moons would orbit the earth,
and that the seas would become oceans of lemonade.
But sprinkled amidst his nonsense were enough kernels of fresh thought to qualify Fourier as an instrumental influence on later socialist thinkers, such as Marx and Engels.
Many think the most valuable of these kernels was Fourier's idea that work,
especially heavy manual labor, could be turned into play: something deeply satisfying both mentally and physically.
That was probably the one vision of Fourier's that most captivated later socialist thinkers.

Hello, Henry.
Yes, I'm afraid the smoker's lounge is about the only place I can relax in around here.
Can I do something for you, or are you just slumming?
Well, I was wondering...
You teach the afternoon section of Modern Social Systems, don't you?
Yes, that's me. Why?
Have you got a student in there by the name of Steiger, Sara Steiger?
Sara? Yes, you know her?
I sure do.
She's in my undergrad psychology seminar.
She's beginning to be a real problem for the class,
and I was just wondering how you were handling her.
Or is she OK in your class?
OK? Uh... Yes.
Well, not really,
but she's just eager to learn, I think, don't you?
You think so?
That's why she never stops asking questions?
I'll tell you what I think,
I think she already knows the answers before she asks.
Or she's just asking for the sake of asking.
Huh? Why's that?
Well, half the time she wants to know about something we've already discussed in some detail,
and half the time she has questions that are off-topic or, well, just, uh, mindless.
I suppose you could be right about that.
Sara can certainly be irritating sometimes.
Sometimes I feel I'm cheating the rest of the students by spending so much time explaining things to her.
Exactly. And I can see them all rolling their eyes.
The rest of my class is a little irritated with her, too.
Maybe we should just give her the benefit of the doubt.
Maybe she's just trying too hard, I dunno, to learn maybe,
or maybe just to make an impression on us.
I don't know what her motives could be.
Yeah, well. She's making an impression, all right, but it isn't a good one.
Any ideas?
Pro-active ones, I mean.
Well, I guess we should have a talk with her.
A talk? A private one, you mean?
Yeah. It's either that, or just give her the cold shoulder.
I'm afraid I've already been giving her a bit of that.
I thought maybe she'd take the hint and sit back, listen and take notes for a change.
She doesn't, doesn't take any notes?
She does in my class, voluminous ones!
Are you sure, Michelle?
Sure, I'm sure, she's always scribbling away.
But have you seen Sara's notes?
Well, no, but...
I have. I took a peek over her shoulder a couple of times.
She's a doodler.
A what?! She doodles?
All over her notebook.
I don't think she's keeping any kind of notes or paying attention at all to what I'm saying or what anyone else says in class.
She's just daydreaming, or dreaming up something irrelevant to inquire into.
This morning we'd been talking about Jung's theory of archetypes,
and she suddenly blurted out ""What's an archtype?""
Well, we'd been discussing archtypes for half an hour by then,
and it was like she'd just realized she'd heard a strange word,
when the conversation was almost over.
Heh! That's Sara, all right.
OK then, who's going to talk to her, you or me?
Umm..
OK, OK, I'll see if I can get her to come in and talk to me later this week.
I'll be seeing her in class tomorrow afternoon, I guess.
Maybe I can get her to settle down a little...
She doodles?
Yes! Pretty good, really.
Complex, architectural, rococo things.
Maybe she could go to art school instead of majoring in sociology.
That's Sara's major, is it?
I think so, I think she mentioned that once.
Anyway, yes, if you could have a little talk with her, that would be great.
And let me know what happens, what you find out, will you?
Of course. I'll let you know how it goes.
Thanks, Michelle, very much. I owe you one.

1333,TOEFL Lecture 8,C1,toefl-lecture-8,73,"Now, we're all familiar, I think, with the United Nations organization,
and we're very accustomed to a world divided into nations
but many of you may not realize how recent the idea of the 'nation-state' really is.
Most of the history of civilization's been a history of much smaller units
from primitive tribes to Greek city-states
and later much of the larger units usually called 'empires'.
The concept of a political and cultural 'nation', as we know it today,
didn't appear until near the end of the 18th century,
at the time of the French and American revolutions.
Let's look at a couple of terms first, just to make them clear.
Strictly speaking, a 'nation' is a cultural concept:
a group of people in a particular area who are usually defined as sharing a common history,
common traditions, the same language or ethnic origin, et cetera.
A 'state', on the other hand, is a political concept:
it's a political unit, an administrative unit, a territory controlled by a government.
So, what we're talking about here, 'nation-states', what we often call 'countries',
are those areas where these two concepts, 'nation' and 'state',
are roughly congruent, where they coincide in time and space.
And this's the basic structure, the infrastructure of civilization, of the world we see today,
the basis upon which treaties are signed, on which wars are fought, and for which people often die.
One historian has said that a nation-state is an 'imaginary community',
because the citizens of even the smallest nation-state will never meet all their fellow citizens,
or even hear about them
yet in each citizen's mind is some image of 'oneness', of unity with his fellows.
Some think that this image is the direct result of the development of printing
and the popular press which likewise expanded in the 18th century
and which, in its language and its audience, has helped define these national communities.
Well, imagined or not, nation-states are very real to us today.
In fact, they seem like the only natural form for society
in spite of their very recent origins don't they?
But at that same time, they seem to be the cause of somewhat turmoil in our world:
wars, nuclear standoffs, ideological conflicts,
conflicts over resources and markets... the list seems endless!
So maybe we'd better take a more careful look at the factors that seem to contribute to the idea of 'nation-statehood'.
First, geography is an obvious factor.
Countries like Japan and New Zealand have very clear boundaries,
and their physical isolation makes these nations very homogeneous.
However, geography is often irrelevant.
Ireland and Cyprus are certainly very strongly divided islands.
And many countries, notably African countries,
have boundaries that have nothing to do with natural features or ethnicity or anything else.
They are simply straight lines drawn in the last century by former colonial powers.
And then there's language, which is also used as a rationale for nationhood.
The United States and Germany and France are all large, successful states that're defined mostly by language.
But on one hand, many international boundaries cut directly across language lines, as with Belgium and The Netherlands
while on the other hand, countries like South Africa and India include speakers of many different languages.
And a common ethnicity that is, a common genetic background and a common cultural heritage
have certainly helped determine the identity of many nation-states.
Nevertheless, many larger countries, like China, are composed of many ethnicities
while other ethnic groups, like the Kurds, for instance, are conspicuously stateless.
Finally one more major determinant is religion.
Religion has also played a big part in defining nations:
Catholic Ireland. Buddhist Nepal. And of course, Jewish Israel.
But again, many states suffer internal strife, violent conflict,
on account of religious differences, Iraq being the most obvious current example.
So it should be clear to you that none of these factors are foolproof definers of the nation-state.
In fact, they often complicate the situation.
Would it then be reasonable, therefore, if we divided Iraq, for instance, into three nations,
into Sunni and Shi'ite and Kurdish nations?
Would that solve many of their problems?
Probably not.
Drawing lines usually just creates new problems.
Minorities become smaller minorities.
Surrounding states endure altered confrontations.
The fracturing of other states is encouraged.
And re-drawing a state's boundaries wrongly suggests that conflicts,
ethnic and religious and linguistic conflicts can be decided by dividing peoples,
when the real solution probably lies in trying to unite them,
lies in recognizing individual rights, in devolving power to the local level,
and in a sort of 'pan-nationalism' that focuses on maximizing cooperation among nation-states
and in that way minimizing the impact of hard boundaries poorly defined by any factor.
This is what is happening so successfully with the European Union,
the organization which we'll be taking a closer look at now.

You're going to be in good shape for the intramurals next month.
Yeah. Whoo! If you don't kill me first.
Wah! Whoosh.... ohh.
OK, I get the hint. You can call it a day.
Just be back here tomorrow at the same time, eh?
I'll be here, but... can I talk to you a minute about something, Coach?
Sure. What is it?
Coach, I'm not, uh, I'm not doing so good in my courses this term.
Huh? What?
I thought you were an 'A' student. How bad could your grades be?
Pretty bad, coach.
The courses are getting harder.
My grades are pretty awful in Cost Accounting, and I'm failing outright in Economics.
I'm just not getting the work done that I need to do.
I just don't have enough time.
How'd you do in your midterms?
Not so good either.
62% on the Economics test,
73% in Cost Accounting.
And 79% in Marketing,
and that's supposed to be an easy course!
I'm not going to graduate, with those kinds of scores.
I've got to get a lot more studying in before the finals, that's all there is to it.
Oh. Um. So?
So... I'm not sure how much time I can give to football anymore.
I was wondering, wondering, uh...
how would it be if maybe I moved back to the B Squad, kind of 'in reserve', so to speak?
'In reserve'?! Cindy, you're the best forward we've got!
I don't know, Coach, Marly's good too.
She just needs a chance to show her stuff.
Yeah, but, she's not you, Cindy, and I, the team, we're counting on you.
We've got to take on SFU first off next month,
and Marly's hardly played with the A Squad at all so far.
I just don't know whether there's time to break her in now.
Oh, I can work with her during practice, Coach.
She can do it, I know she can, and...
Wait a minute, wait a minute, don't we have any other option?
What option is that?
Well... how about a tutor?
Yeah, how about us finding you a tutor for those courses?
Somebody that, you know, could kind of give you what you need to pass your finals.
Aw, Coach, I've gotta learn all this stuff myself.
There's life after football, you know!
There's a lot of competition for jobs out there when I graduate, IF I graduate!
I know, Cindy.
You're absolutely right!
I just don't want to lose you right before the tournament.
You've worked so hard to get this far, and so have all your teammates.
Yeah. That's why I feel so bad about this.
But I need this time to study, I really do.
I know I'm just clutching at straws now, but how about this, then?
I let you work Marly into your position in A Squad this week,
and then you take the next two weeks completely off from practice,
study hard, and, when's your first exam?
Uh... Economics is first. March 30th.
OK, you take all the time off you need until then,
and if you pass that exam, come back for the first round of the tournament at least, OK?
That's the big one.
If we can get past SFU, then confidence will carry us along from there.
And we'll also have time to reassess your situation.
Deal?
Can't make a deal yet, Coach, I just can't.
Let me sleep on it, will you?
Let me look at my schedule and try to figure this all out,
and then I'll get back to you. I promise.
And think about that tutor, too.
We'll get you one of those too, if you think it will help.
I don't want to jeopardize your career any more than you do,
and grades come first in my books, too.
Thanks, really, I feel like you're taking real good care of me.
Yeah, well, just take your time, you gotta do what you gotta do.
But think it over.
You're going to leave a big hole in the offense if you take off.
Thanks.
Anyway, I'll be in tomorrow afternoon for more of your torture.
Right now I gotta take a shower and get out of here.
Good. No partying tonight, you hear?

1335,TOEFL Lecture 9,C1,toefl-lecture-9,72,"As a part of our study of the effects of diseases on society,
of the, uh, social consequences of man's diseases,
we should certainly include yellow fever.
Now, yellow fever's a deadly disease that's caused by a virus,
and it's been the source of many epidemics since at least the eighteenth century
in Africa, Europe, and the Americas.
In fact, it still kills more than 30,000 people a year worldwide.
And there's still no cure for the disease.
However, there is a vaccine to immunize us against it.
The road to the discovery of that vaccine was a rocky one, I think.
It's called 'yellow' fever because one of its symptoms is jaundice -
a yellowish colour that the skin takes on, because of liver damage.
It's transmitted by mosquitoes, either from man to man - this's called the 'urban' cycle -
or from monkey to man - this's called the 'sylvatic' or 'jungle' cycle.
The disease probably originated in west Africa,
and it was carried from there to the West Indies
and the New World in the eighteenth century with the ships of the slave trade.
The first big outbreak of yellow fever happened in Cuba in 1762 and 1763,
and it killed thousands of American and British colonial troops there.
After that, between then and 1900,
it killed about ten percent of Cuba's population.
The next big epidemic hit in the heart of the United States,
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1793.
It killed five thousand people there,
while twenty thousand more fled the city in panic.
These included President George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,
Alexander Hamilton, Dolly Madison,
and most of the federal government officials.
Because you might remember that Philadelphia was the capital of the United States then.
Washington, DC was still under construction,
and it would not be a working seat of government until 1800.
About twenty years after the Philadelphia epidemic,
another significant yellow fever epidemic hit Haiti.
In 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte had sent an expedition of 40,000 soldiers there
with the intention of using the island as a base for invading the United States, by way of New Orleans.
New Orleans was at that time still in the hands of France.
But Napoleon's army - including its commander, who was Napoleon's brother-in-law -
was completely decimated by the fever,
and his invasion plans were abandoned.
Later in the same century, in the 1880s,
France was again foiled, and history was again changed, by yellow fever.
The French effort to build the Panama Canal ended in failure
as a result of the heavy toll on the workers and technicians, from both yellow fever and malaria.
These epidemics continued to occur over and over
because no one had been able to figure out how the disease was transmitted,
how it was carried from person to person.
In Philadelphia, Benjamin Rush - who was a signer of the Declaration of Independence
and also the chief medical officer for the new government -
Doctor Rush relied so heavily on blood-letting as a treatment
that he probably killed more people than he cured.
The most widespread theory was that yellow fever spread through contaminated water
or by direct physical contact with infected people,
and some people actually abandoned family members in their panic.
The idea that mosquitos were the disease vector, the method of transmission,
had been proposed in 1881, by a Cuban scientist named Carlos Finlay,
but he hadn't been able to prove this to the satisfaction of other scientists.
It wasn't until twenty years later, in 1900, that Carlos Finlay's idea was finally proved.
The United States Army had occupied Cuba after the Spanish American War of 1898,
and since Cuba was still considered to be the breeding ground for yellow fever in the New World,
the US government commissioned a US Army surgeon, Doctor Walter Reed,
to solve the problem before its occupation forces also succumbed to this disease.
And Doctor Reed's team did soon prove that the mosquitoes were the culprits,
at their research center just outside Havana.
As a result, yellow fever was quickly eliminated from Cuba,
and the US Public Health Service started a mosquito control program
that included fumigation, eliminating or treating standing pools and bodies of water, and so forth.
In addition, the Panama Canal was completed by the Americans -
who then controlled the canal's operation for the next 99 years.
And Walter Reed - well, Walter Reed's name should be familiar to many of you.
The Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC
is the well-known hospital where the US President, US congressmen,
and US military personnel receive medical treatment.

1337,TOEFL Lecture 10,C2,toefl-lecture-10,69,"My next topic I'm sure will interest all of you,
I want to talk to you now about Black Holes.
Simply speaking, a black hole is what's left after a large star dies.
You're already aware that a star is an energy producer, a nuclear fusion reactor,
its core is a gigantic nuclear fusion bomb that's trying to explode,
but its mass of surrounding gases is so large that its gravity contains the explosion,
and the balance that exists between the gravity and the fusion is what determines the star's size.
However, as a star gets older, as it ages,
its fuels get used up and its nuclear reactor slows down.
And then, its gravity gets the upper hand.
The star implodes.
Gravity pulls inward and compresses the stellar material into the star's center.
As it's compressed, the core heats up tremendously,
and then, at some point, a supernova, a great explosion, occurs,
and the stellar material and a lot of radiation are blasted out into space.
Only the extremely dense, extremely massive core is left.
Its gravitational field is so strong that nothing can escape it, not even light.
So it disappears from view: it's black.
It's now a black hole.
Now, the idea of a 'black hole', an object with so much gravity that it won't let light escape,
was first proposed more than two hundred years ago, in 1795,
by a French mathematician, Pierre LaPlace.
He used Newton's gravitational theory to calculate
that if an object was compressed small enough,
it would require an escape velocity of almost 300,000 kilometers per second, the speed of light.
More recently, the name of Stephen Hawking, the great British physicist, has become synonymous with black hole theory.
A black hole consists of two parts, a 'singularity' and an 'event horizon'.
Its 'singularity' is the point where its gravity is indefinitely strong
and its mass is indefinitely dense,
and this point is theoretically at the center of the black hole's core.
And its 'event horizon' is the perimeter around the core at the distance where its gravity is still strong enough to pull light into itself,
at the distance where escape velocity equals the speed of light,
and where nothing can escape its pull.
Both the singularity and the event horizon are intangible, of course,
but both of them can be calculated mathematically.
The distance of the event horizon from the core is called the 'Schwartzchild radius',
and this radius is equal to ""two GM divided by C squared"",
where G is Newton's gravitational constant,
M equals the mass of the core,
and C equals the speed of light.
Even though we can't see them, black holes do exist,
and we can prove their existence in three basic ways.
One way is to search for celestial objects that are very small but that have a very large mass.
For example, the astronomical feature called 'M87' is only about the size of our solar system,
but it weighs three billion times more than our Sun.
So it's a good bet that M87 is a black hole.
Another way to find a black hole is to search for matter that's accelerating,
because a black hole accelerates anything that approaches it.
As the matter gets sucked in, it speeds up and heats up,
and this superheated matter produces X-rays, which can be detected.
The star Cygnus X-1 is a strong X-ray source,
so there's a good possibility that there's a black hole in its neighborhood.
And finally, a black hole can be detected using Einstein's Theory of Relativity,
which tells us that gravity can actually bend space, warp space.
An object with a lot of gravity located between Earth and a more distant star
can bend that star's light like a lens or a prism does.
This is called the gravitational lens effect.
In 1996, a gravitational lens passed between Earth and MACHO-96-BL5,
and the temporarily brightened image was photographed by both the Hubble Space Telescope and ground observers.
'Black holes' are a bit frightening, but if the idea of a black hole sucking in the rest of the Universe upsets you,
let's put them into perspective.
A black hole doesn't suck in everything in sight,
it only affects nearby material.
If a black hole with the same mass suddenly replaced our Sun,
then its Schwartzchild radius would be only three kilometers,
compared to our Sun's radius of 700,000 kilometers!
And since Earth is 150 million kilometers from the Sun,
it would be in no danger of being sucked in.
Without the Sun, though, Earth would be very cold and lifeless, I'm afraid!

That's a feather in your cap. Everybody says they're really cool.
Yeah, they are. But they've also got a good reputation for academics, too.
They've got the highest GPA on Fraternity Row.
Hmm, that means you're gonna have to keep up your average, too.
Yeah, but I figure that'll be easier to do with a little help from some Omega Theta friends.
You've got friends there?
I will if I join.
They've got a pretty strict study regimen:
everyone gets assigned a tutor, an upper-class brother, kind of an academic buddy system.
They say it works good.
Sounds good if you need that.
And I do. I'm not a self-starter at all.
Left to myself, I tend to fiddle around and get nothing done.

if I go to the library or the coffee shop to study, I do better,
but if I sit around here, I just dawdle.
I listen to music or pick at the guitar or, uh, anything to avoid getting down to my assignments.

1339,TOEFL Lecture 11,C1,toefl-lecture-11,72,"Before we examine the modern American entertainment industry,
Broadway shows, Hollywood movies, rock concerts, television, and all that,
let's take a short look at the beginnings of organized entertainment in America.
Almost since the very beginning of the country,
Americans had been able to enjoy itinerant performances of one kind or another,
shows that travelled around to find their audiences, in towns and villages across the continent.
Travelling medicine shows, offering jugglers and music along with their snake oil and miracle tonics, were popular.
Then there were Buffalo Bill Cody's 'Wild West Shows',
with trick riders and dramatic re-enactments, which toured the country,
as did several circuses like Barnum and Bailey's.
And then there were the showboats, paddle-wheelers carried music and comedy up and down our river systems,
up and down the Mississippi River and the Missouri River, and the Ohio River.
Meanwhile, town halls, saloons and music halls, dime museums and burlesque houses,
all sprang up across the country, wherever people had some money to burn and were looking for a little fun.
But then, after the Civil War, after 1865,
America's social structure began to change, change radically.
The country began to grow economically, and its cities began to grow,
and an American middle class began to develop, with increased spending power and leisure time.
This was also a time of industrial growth, and transportation and communication technologies improved rapidly.
Businesses became large and national in scope.
And it was at this same time that entertainment became an industry, with the appearance of Vaudeville.
Vaudeville was something new, the first mass entertainment,
in that it no longer catered to just the gullible or to those looking for the risque.
From its inception, it was geared toward middle-class men and women and families
and it very quickly spread nationwide.
Its performance halls were alcohol-free and its hall managers demanded decorum,
no spitting on the floor or jeering the acts,
and its performers were denied the use of bawdy material.
Vaudeville was the first family entertainment.
Theatre historians usually date Vaudeville's beginning at October 24th, 1881,
when a former circus ringmaster, Tony Pastor,
first offered 'polite' variety programs in his New York City theatres.
Pastor hoped to draw his audience from the uptown shopping traffic,
from the salaried workers and their wives and children.
He barred alcohol sales and risque material from his theatres,
and he offered luxurious facilities,
and he gave out door prizes like hams and coal to his patrons,
and his idea proved so successful that other theatre managers soon followed suit.
Incredibly, by the 1890s,
Vaudeville has already developed into regional and national chains of theatres,
with sophisticated booking and contract systems.
At its height, Vaudeville performed before a broad range of theatre sizes and economic classes,
the so-called 'small time', and 'medium time', and 'big time'.
And it was the 'big time' that all of its entertainers hoped to rise to:
the Big Time, with its palacial urban theatres and its salaries of several thousand dollars a week!
An act could be just about anything that was entertaining and inoffensive,
escape artists like the great Houdini,
high divers, contortionists, hypnotists, lap dancers, trained animals,
every imaginable kind of novelty act.
And of course, there were the headliners,
the singers and dancers and comedians whose popularity drew the customers.
Some of their careers outlasted Vaudeville.
WC Fields, Will Rogers, Al Jolsen, Kate Smith,
Eddie Cantor, George Burns, Jack Benny,
these names you might not recognize now,
but they were some of the greatest Vaudevillians, who went on as far as the early years of movies and then television,
and set the performance standards in those media as well,
who set many of the performance styles we still enjoy today.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, in 1902,
the new medium of the motion picture, an early silent movie,
was first incorporated into a Vaudeville bill between the live acts.
Thirty years later, on November 16th, 1932,
New York's Palace Theatre, the capital of Vaudeville,
offered its first exclusively cinematic presentation,
and this is considered Vaudeville's official end,
the point in time where movies overtook live performances in the hearts of American audiences.
For Vaudeville itself, it was a relatively brief stardom,
only about fifty years from start to finish,
but actually, the spirit of Vaudeville lived on.
Its performers moved into the movies or onto Broadway,
and then many of these stars moved on to television.

1340,TOEFL Conversation 12,B2,toefl-conversation-12,82,"Ah, there you are. Hi, Jared.
Hi, Colleen. You still got time?
Yes, I've got almost an hour.
My next class isn't until three-thirty.
That should be enough time, shouldn't it?
We haven't got that much to decide now.
It depends how it goes.
We've got our topic, but we haven't divided up the workload yet.
And we haven't even discussed how to approach it, really.
I thought one of us was going to take the coelenterates and the other was going to do the sponges.
Seems pretty simple.
Yeah, well, that's fine for the basic research,
but don't forget that we've got to make the presentation together.
We just can't be 'stings' and 'squirts', like Laurel and Hardy.
We're going to have to field questions from the rest of the seminar, and from Doctor Mankiewicz, too!
Yeah, and they can be brutal! So?
So, we both have to have a pretty good grasp of the whole thing, the overall picture.
Don't forget that the key word is 'comparative',
'A Comparison of the Adaptive Evolution of the Coelenterata and Porifera'.
It's not just how jellyfish have evolved and how sponges've evolved,
but a, an analysis of their comparative success.
So I guess we need to get together and really look at that together, don't we?
Yes, we sure do.
And it's going to take some thinking,
because I don't think we're going to find all that much material on this idea.
There're whole books on invertebrate evolution...
Yeah, but each phylum is kind of looked at independently,
you know, at least they're in the same texts I've been reading through.
Which are?
Hyman's 'Invertebrates'.
McEdward's 'Ecology of Marine Invertebrates'.
McEdward's really good, he's got a lot of fascinating examples,
but he doesn't really look at one phylum versus another in term of relative, uh, relative success.
He just marvels at their individual, uh, creativity.
Well, that's good stuff...
But we're gonna have to take it a step further than that.
Well, look, we're still beginning with each of us researching a phylum, aren't we?
Yes, yes, that's still a good starting point for sure, but...
I know, so let's get going on that then,
learn something about these critters, and then try to put it together after we've got an idea what we're talking about.
We've got six weeks to do this thing,
so why don't we, well, bulldoze our way through this first part in, say, two weeks?
And then plan to get together a lot after that to intercalate what we've found.
And get some original ideas.
Yeah, OK.
We can, like, mini-present to each other and see what angles we can come up with.
Put four weeks into that, and we might have something.
So, what do you like?
Huh? What do I what?
Which ones you want, sponges or jellyfish?
Oh. Yeah. Huh!
Y'know, they're actually both very intriguing.
Amazing beasts.
Frankly, though, the coelenterates look pretty daunting,
there's such a, you know, range of forms and behaviour.
The sponges seem much more manageable.
But what about you?
I'm easy, really.
Ha! That's funny,
to me, the Porifera seem kind of boring.
They're so, so... sessile.
They just sit there and filter.
They remind me of my grandfather.
I like that. Stick it in the presentation!
Maybe.
Anyway, I'll be happy to take the jellyfish,
they interest me much more.
OK. Say, this is working out well so far.
Yeah, but the hard part comes later.
So, shall we look at our schedules and see if we can arrange a regular time to meet?
Uh, sure. Once a week?
For now, yeah, that's enough, I guess.
Well, how about this time?
Um... yeah, that'll be good for me.
So... Tuesdays at 1 p.m.?
Fine. Uh... here?
This'll be OK, I think.
Not too noisy after lunch hour.
All right, then I'll see you next week, on the seventh.
No! I'll see you in the seminar on Thursday, won't I?
Huh, yep. Gotta go.
Right. Thanks. Later.

1341,TOEFL Lecture 12,C2,toefl-lecture-12,72,"We're looking at animal behaviour this week,
and let's turn now, class, to one of its most dramatic manifestations, animal mimicry.
Organisms that are good to eat, or that are attacked for other reasons,
often develop devices, through evolution, of course,
techniques and devices to protect themselves from their attackers,
in order to survive, and in order to reproduce and pass their genes on to the next generation.
And one of these techniques, one of these strategies,
is to look like something else, to look like something that is not good to eat,
or something that is otherwise of no interest to the predator.
An organism that does this, that resembles something else, is called a 'mimic',
and the thing that it has evolved to resemble is called the 'model',
while the predator that it is trying to mislead is called the 'recipient',
the one that receives the misleading image.
Some mimics do this by adopting camouflage, which is a cryptic resemblance to something of no interest to its enemy,
and by doing this, they become invisible, they are hidden.
Many animals, insects, lizards, amphibians, mimic the abundant plant life in the habitat around them.
I'm sure that you've seen green grasshoppers and brown moths
that seem to be well-hidden on grass stems and tree trunks when they're motionless.
But the Leaf-tailed Gecko, a small lizard in Madagascar, is a master at this.
It avoids its enemies by looking exactly like a cluster of old dead leaves.
And there are various species of katydids, grasshopper-like insects, that have managed to duplicate the appearance of leaves with startling accuracy,
in all stages of growth, some species looking like fresh green leaves
and others looking like old decaying leaves, complete with leaf veins, weathered edges and mildew spots!
These adaptations make these animals difficult or impossible for a predator to identify or even notice,
and so these otherwise defenseless creatures are overlooked or passed by.
Other organisms defend themselves directly with stings or bites, or with poisons or other noxious chemicals,
and such organisms often assume bold, characteristic colors and markings, called warning coloration,
that warns a predator, reminds it, that this creature can inflict pain or discomfort,
or that it tastes very bad.
The bold orange-and-black pattern of the common Monarch Butterfly,
or the black-and-yellow bands on a bumblebee, are such warning colorations.
And sometimes, this warning coloration is so effective
that another species, a species that doesn't have any of the protective devices of sting or poison or whatever,
will adopt the same warning colors and pattern.
This sort of mimicry is called 'Batesian mimicry'.
The name comes from the early zoologist, HW Bates,
who, back in 1862, first suggested an explanation for the origins of mimicry
based on Charles Darwin's new Theory of Natural Selection.
This was one of the earliest applications of Darwin's ideas to an unknown biological phenomenon.
Now, Viceroy Butterflies taste good to many birds,
but because they mimic the Monarch Butterflies model's color pattern,
because Viceroy Butterflies look like Monarch Butterflies,
they are avoided, just like the Monarch is.
In the same way, many harmless fly species resemble the bumblebee model,
and also in this way they avoid being eaten by the recipients, birds.
So these are Batesian mimics.
There are several conditions that must be fulfilled, though, for a Batesian mimic to be successful,
the mimic must of course share the same general region and habitat as its model,
but the mimic must also be less numerous than its model,
which must be relatively abundant.
That way, the odds are that the recipient predator will sample an unpalatable model first,
which is very important for keeping the trick effective.
A similar kind of mimicry is 'Muellerian mimicry',
named after another early biologist,
and in this sort of mimicry, both the model and the mimic are dangerous or taste bad.
A very obvious example is the way that so many unrelated species of bees, wasps, and ants
have assumed similar, bold, black-and-yellow or black-and-orange banded patterns.
By doing this, M√ºllerian mimics present a united image that predators soon learn to be wary of.
There's also another aspect of mimicry that I'd like to mention, too,
and that's the mimicry used by predators.
This is called 'aggressive mimicry',
and it is used to conceal or misrepresent a predator until its prey comes near enough to capture.
Many mantids, for example, are green or brown,
so that they blend in with their plant surroundings,
but some tropical mantids are fantastically shaped and colored,
like the beautiful Orchid Mantis, which resembles a petal of one of those tropical flowers,
and it hides motionless next to one of these orchids until an insect comes within its reach.
There are also several green-colored vine and grass snakes of various families,
which lie invisible among the tangled vines and branches of the jungle
until they suddenly lash out to grab their prey.
Actually, there are an endless number of ingenious mimics in the natural world,
and I recommend that you all try a Google Images search tonight for some more interesting examples of this fascinating behaviour.

1342,TOEFL Conversation 13,B2,toefl-conversation-13,92,"Excuse me, Mr. Morgan?
Oh, hi... uh... Lindsey, isn't it?
Come in, Lindsey.
I haven't seen you in quite a while, have I?
How can I help you?
Well...if you have a few minutes...
I need you to help me sort out my credit hours.
It's kind of an, uh, an emergency.
OK, sit down.
I've got a few minutes right now.
Thanks very much.
So, what's the problem with your credit hours?
Well... um... I think I may not have the right ones.
The ones I need to graduate, I mean.
What's your major again? Business Management?
Yeah, it's supposed to be.
For Biz Ad, I still need to take Global Economics - EC 303
and, well, I've got room for it in my schedule but, erm...
303's got a prerequisite, which I, uh, I haven't taken.
EC 203, Econometrics.
Oh, that's just great.
And how did you manage that, Lindsey?
Not paying attention.
I didn't notice until now that I needed 303 to graduate,
and didn't notice before that I needed 203 before.
Is there anything I can do now to fix this?
Well, I'm not sure.
It's possible that the dean would let you take them concurrently.
It's been done before, in extremis.
Well, that's what I'm in - extremis.
The last term before graduation and I'm stuck.
Do you think he would, really?
It's possible, if your grades are good enough and everything else is in order.
Are they? Is it?
Oh, yeah! My GPA's 3.7.
And I've got all the other required credits, and then some.
I've actually taken more electives than I need to.
Hmm. Too many electives and a missed prerequisite.
Good work, Lindsey.
Yeah, pretty dumb, eh?
OK, well, they're both offered this term, I hope?
Oh yes.
Global Economics is Tuesday through Thursdays at 3 pm
and Econometrics is the same days at 11 in the morning.
Those would work fine, except, uh....
Except what?
Except I've already signed up for the second half of my statistics course:
Stats 202 at eleven.
Is that a required course?
No, but it's highly recommended for business majors.
And I really need that math.
Math is my weak point, I'm afraid,
and I'm going to use a lot of it if I go into finance like I want to.
Lindsey, do you know what, um, Econometrics is?
Sure! Uh... I guess... what?
It's, uh, ""measuring economies"", ""econo"" plus ""metrics"", isn't it?
It's math, Lindsey. Statistics.
It's a course in the kinds of statistics used in business, finance, and economics.
Oh... so maybe I don't need Stats 202 then?
That's right.
Biz Ad makes sure you get the necessary math by requiring Econometrics.
But you've taken Statistics 201 already?
Yes.
Hmm. Listen, there may be another solution to this.
The dean might accept Stats 201 and 202 in place of Econometrics.
Really? That'd be great!
He might.
Anyway, I'm going to have to call his office about this, about both possibilities, right away.
Let me just see what they say.
If you had a choice, which option would it be?
Uh... well, unless they really want me to take Econometrics,
I think it would be easier if I completed the second half of my statistics course.
I mean, then I'd have the whole course under my belt.
But whatever the dean wants, I'm happy to do whatever it takes to graduate on time.
OK, good.
Well, with two options, he may be more amenable to exempting you from the prerequisite.
Can you bring me a copy of your transcript later today?
I've got one right here, Mr Morgan.
Here you go.
Ah. Mmm. Yes. it does look good, Lindsey.
3.7 and a good scattering of 'A's, too!
OK. I'll arrange to see the dean as soon as I can,
if not today, then tomorrow morning, I hope.
And we'll try to get this straightened out for you.
Stop by tomorrow afternoon about three, will you?
Sure! And thanks.
Thank you very much.
OK. And don't worry too much.
The dean can be quite flexible in a good cause.
See you tomorrow, then.
Thanks so much, Mr Morgan.
See you tomorrow afternoon at 3.

1343,TOEFL Lecture 13,C1,toefl-lecture-13,83,"Benjamin Franklin was a renowned statesman,
a successful proprietor, an avid philosopher,
and a prolific scie... uh, inventor.
As we learned from our reading this week,
his inventions include bifocals, the Franklin stove, the odometer,
and, of course, the lightening rod.
Today, though, I want to argue the case that Franklin's greatest legacy was not in any of those roles,
or as a founding father of the United States, but as a writer.
Do any of you know a book that Franklin has written?
Anyone?
Well, that's because Franklin wrote, er, didn't write any great novels,
a la later US greats like Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Mark Twain.
But I think an analysis of Franklin's writing style,
his instincts, his sensibilities and his accomplishments
reveals that he deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as those literary giants.
Like Hemingway, Franklin began as a newspaper reporter,
then moved on to publish essays, journals and books.
His most famous books are Autobiography, the Way to Wealth and Poor Richard's Almanack,
an annual publication that he founded and authored from 1732 to 1748.
Franklin's first literary contributions were essays printed in 1722
in the New England Courant,
a newspaper published by his brother James.
Ben's writing style at this time was modeled principally upon that of The Spectator,
a British paper edited by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele.
Early on, though, Franklin displayed an innate ability to write concise, clear news stories.
In 1729, he became publisher and editor of The Pennsylvania Gazette,
which he developed into a newspaper universally acclaimed as the best in the American colonies.
Franklin made three great contributions to American literature.
First was his preference to share his opinion about popular topics,
instead of simply reporting on current events
much in the vein of a modern newspaper columnist.
Through his writings, Franklin helped shape America's national identity,
by shifting Americans' consciousness from a spiritual Puritanism to, uh,
secular rationalism, which was characteristic of 18th century enlightenment.
He thus created a percep... uh,
a dawning awareness that America was a country with distinctly different values and interests than those of England.
Poor Richard's Almanack and his Autobiography, for example,
are written in the style of self-help guides.
They're packed with enlightenment maxims such as
""an investment in knowledge pays the best interest,""
""time is money,""
and ""hear reason, or she'll make you feel her.""
Franklin imbued his journalism with a similar tone.
In an article entitled ""Death of a Drunk,"" for instance,
he used a true story to pass on a moral lesson about the dangers of drinking.
Author Robert Arner said that Franklin's writings ""demonstrate a,"" um,
""deep and abiding belief in the power of the press to educate the public on topical issues.""
Franklin's second contribution was his sense for unusual and interesting news stories,
which set a tone that has carried over to modern newspapers.
The Pennsylvania Gazette specialized in brief, offbeat articles,
such as a husband who tried to decapitate his wife's adulterer,
and a fiddler who saved his fiddle - but not his wife - from a capsized canoe.
Although some criticized this as sensationalistic, or ""yellow"" journalism,
Franklin's venerable wisdom and natural wit permeated the short reports
and attracted a huge and loyal audience.
In this sense, we might call Franklin the father of tabloid journalism.
So you can thank Ben next time you're in a supermarket checkout line and see the headline:
""Michael Jackson spotted on UFO.""
Franklin's third significant contribution to US literature is his writing style,
which reflects the philosophy he expressed in a 1732 essay.
Good writing, he said, should be ""smooth, clear and short"".
Compared with other eighteenth century authors, Franklin's writing is much more concise and readable.
That comparison holds not only among his contemporaries, however,
but also among writers in the following three centuries.
Franklin played a leading role in developing journalism as a terse writing form,
getting quickly to the point and dwelling on important issues instead of secondary facts.
Moreover, Franklin was a word economist,
finding the shortest way to express a thought,
as demonstrated by his vast coinages of aphorisms.
The chief reason Franklin's sayings remain popular today
is due not to their moral wisdom but to their brevity.
Advice such as, ""Well done is better than well said;""
""when in doubt, don't""
dispense moral certitudes in sentences that are catchy and easy to remember -
a timeless writing tip.
How many of you have heard your English teacher mention KISS?
KISS
What does that mean?
Keep it short and simple.
Yep. Keep it short and simple.
That was a formula Ben Franklin was practicing long before someone coined a name for it.
Given all this, it's no wonder that Scottish philosopher David Hume called Franklin,
""America's first great man of letters.""

1344,Lecture: Iroquois and Huron peoples,B2,lecture-iroquois-and-huron-peoples,73,"So we've been discussing 16th century Native American life,
and today we're gonna focus on the Iroquois and Huron peoples.
They lived in the northeastern Great Lakes region of North America.
Now, back then, their lives depended on the natural resources of the forest, especially the birch tree.
The birch tree can grow in many different types of soils and is prevalent in that area.
Now, can anyone here describe a birch tree?
Umm, they're tall?
And‚Ä¶ white? The bark, I mean.
Yes, the birch tree has white bark.
And this tough protective outer layer of the tree, this... this white bark, is waterproof,
and this waterproof quality of the bark...
oh, it made it useful for making things like cooking containers‚Ä¶
a variety of utensils.
And if you peel birch bark in the winter, we call it the ‚Äúwinter bark‚Äù
another layer, a tougher inner layer of the tree adheres to the bark,
producing a stronger material‚Ä¶
so the ‚Äúwinter bark‚Äù was used for larger utensils and containers.
Umm, I know people make utensils out of wood, but‚Ä¶ utensils out of tree bark?
Well, birch bark is pliable and very easy to bend.
The Native Americans would cut the bark and fold it into any shape they needed,
then secure it with cords until it dried.
They could fold the bark into many shapes.
So, if they cooked in bowls made of birch bark,
wouldn't that make the food taste funny?
Oh, that's one of the great things about birch bark.
The taste of the birch tree doesn't get transferred to the food,
so it was perfect for cooking containers.
But the most important use of the bark by far was the canoe.
Since the northeast region of North America is...
it's interconnected by many streams and waterways,
water transportation by vessels like a canoe was most essential.
The paths through the woods were often overgrown, so... so water travel was much faster.
And here's what the Native Americans did‚Ä¶
they would peel large sheets of bark from the tree to form lightweight yet sturdy canoes.
The bark was stretched over frames made from tree branches,
stitched together and sealed with resin,
you know that, that sticky liquid that comes out of the tree,
and when it dries, it's watertight.
One great thing about these birch bark canoes was, they could carry a large amount of cargo.
For example, a canoe weighing about 50 pounds
could carry up to 9 people and 250 pounds of cargo.
Wow!
But how far could they travel that way?
Well, like I said,
the northeastern region is interconnected by rivers and streams and the ocean at the coast.
The canoes allowed them to travel over a vast area that...
that today would take a few hours to fly over.
You see, the Native Americans made canoes of all types,
for travel on small streams or on large open ocean waters.
For small streams they made narrow, maneuverable boats,
while larger canoes were needed for the ocean.
They could travel throughout the area, only occasionally having to portage -
- to carry the canoe over land a short distance - to another nearby stream.
And since the canoes were so light, this wasn't a difficult task.
Now, how do you think this affected their lives?
Well, if they could travel so easily over such a large area,
they could trade with people from other areas, which I guess, would lead them to form alliances?
Exactly.
Having an efficient means of transportation, well, that helped the Iroquois to form a federation,
linked by natural waterways,
and this federation expanded from...
what is now southern Canada all the way south to the Delaware River.
And, this efficiency of the birch bark canoe also made an impression on newcomers to the area.
French traders in the 17th century modeled their‚Ä¶
well, they adopted the design of the Iroquois birch bark canoes
and they found that they could travel great distances -
more than 1500 kilometers a month.
Now, besides the bark, Native Americans also used the wood of the birch tree.
The young trees were used as supports for lodgings,
with the waterproof bark used as roofing.
Branches were folded into snowshoes,
and the Native American people were all adept at running‚Ä¶ running very fast over the snow in these...
these birch branch snowshoes, which, if you've ever tried walking in snowshoes, you know isn't easy.

1345,Lecture: Notothenioids,C1,lecture-notothenioids,74,"So! Continuing our discussions of environmental adaptation,
today I want to focus on a species of fish, called the Notothenioids.
A bit of a mouthful, I know.
Scientists have documented over 90 species of Notothenioids, in both deep and shallow waters.
If you're getting creeped out by the powerpoint slide, don't worry,
they really only live around Antarctica.
Most of them are pretty small.
However, a few species can weigh up to 150 kilograms.
These fish can be identified by their huge eyes,
insulated with a layer of thick transparent protective tissue.
This kind of tissue protects the fluid in their eyeballs from freezing in the incredibly cold seawater.
Remember, saltwater has a lower freezing point than freshwater,
so moisture in an animal's tissue would be particularly vulnerable to freezing and causing cell death.
So while the cold ocean of Antarctica could freeze and kill most fish,
the Notothenioids end up thriving in these icy waters.
They actually make up nearly 95% of all fish species
in the southern ocean around that cold continent.
That kind of thing is a stark contrast to tropical oceans,
where the biodiversity is extremely high.
When you think of a tropical reef, for instance,
you probably imagine a plethora of different types of fish and sea creatures
living together and preying on each other.
The average coral reef supports over four thousand types of fish, sponges, crustaceans, and others.
To have one species of fish in an entire section of the ocean?
Pretty impressive.
Yes! Amy?
When did the Notothenioids end up taking over the southern ocean?
I'm glad you asked.
That was actually my next point of interest.
So, about thirty million years ago,
the water in that area was a lot warmer than it is today.
Way back then, South America and Antarctica were actually connected.
The air from around the equator could travel south to heat up the chilly Antarctic waters.
The warm tropical waters could also flow southwards,
bringing the rich biodiversity along with it.
Because Antarctica's waters were relatively warm back then,
it could support a lot of different types of animals.
We confirmed this by looking at the fossil record,
even finding out that 90 or so of the Notothenioids even existed back then.
Historians think that somewhere between five and fourteen million years ago,
two huge changes occurred.
First of all, a chance mutation allowed the Notothenioids to develop a special protein
that now flows through their body.
Umm, this special protein is actually a type of antifreeze.
It works by bonding to an ice crystal that formed inside their flesh,
preventing it from growing any larger.
So! At the time, the waters they swam in were still decently warm,
and the protein didn't do much for their overall survival rates.
Still, somewhere around this time period,
there are records of a colossal shift that moved around the Earth's tectonic plates.
This movement is now known as Continental drift.
It pushed Antarctica away from South America
and down toward the chilly southern end of the earth.
This caused a current to swirl up and form,
encircling the cooling continent with a rush of cold water.
This cold water prevented warmer tides from intermingling.
It eventually dropped to the sub-zero icy landscape we know today.
As you may have guessed,
the tropical fish didn't do so well in the sudden drop of environmental temperatures,
and many species went extinct.
Luckily for the Notothenioids,
they had a handy dandy gene mutation that let them produce this antifreeze protein.
Now the only type of fish that could survive the cold waters,
it had virtually no competition for food or resources and went wild.
So! As its population increased dramatically,
they migrated into different parts of oceans.
Over time they developed different physical adaptations to survive in their particular environment.
Eventually they split off into subspecies, mutated a bit more,
had a bit of geologic morphology going on, very cool stuff.
We call this kind of physical differentiation: process of Adaptive Radiation.
It really only happens when a species rapidly changes,
and ends up with quite a few new species to fill empty niches
that either didn't exist before, or weren't available.
So now we have about 90 species of Notothenioids, kicking it in the southern ocean.

1346,Discuss: Bicycle club,B1,discuss-bicycle-club,70,"Hi.
Good afternoon.
Come on in.
Okay.
So, what can I help you with today?
Well, I want to join the bicycle club.
Joining clubs is a great thing to do.
Unfortunately, the bicycle club currently has no events
because the office is being renovated.
Oh‚Ä¶ well, when is it going to be done?
The anticipated date of completion is next semester,
though it could take as long as a year.
Wow‚Ä¶ that's a long time.
That's a bummer.
I do apologize.
It's not your fault, I guess.
Umm‚Ä¶ so are there other clubs I can join instead?
Absolutely.
There are a wide variety of clubs throughout campus.
Since you were interested in the bicycle club,
I would recommend the hiking club or rock climbing club.
They are popular options for students who are interested in exercising and meeting friends.
Those could be nice.
It's too bad about the bicycle club, though.
But, yeah, those would work.
How about the hiking club, when is it?
The hiking club meets Friday evenings.
That won't work then.
I have biology class on Friday night.
I didn't think finding a club would be this hard.
Don't get discouraged.
It's all about finding the right fit.
In the future, the bicycle club's office will be finished and they will start up again.
You won't always have biology on Friday nights either.
What about the rock climbing club?
I do really like climbing.
When is that one?
Let's see‚Ä¶
the rock climbing club meets Tuesday afternoons.
Okay‚Ä¶ okay yeah,
I don't have any class or anything going on then.
So you'd like to join the rock climbing club?
Yes, please!
Alright.
So, the process isn't too complicated.
You just have to pay the dues, which aren't very large,
and then fill out your contact information and attend the next meeting.
Is it going to be their first ever meeting?
Like, will I be that strange new person that nobody knows?
It is not their first meeting,
but you really don't need to worry.
The whole point of clubs is that they're social and welcoming to new people.
I'm sure you'll fit right in.
That's easy to say, but what if I don't?
Well, thinking negatively like that will only hurt your chances.
So first, try to stay positive.
They will probably ask you to introduce yourself,
so they can get to know you a little bit and you'll be good from there.
Stuff like that makes me nervous.
It's perfectly normal to be nervous.
But remember, everybody there was the new person at some point.
But, if for some reason it doesn't work out for you,
you can always come back to me.
There are plenty of clubs for all kinds of people.
And like I said before,
you may be able to join the hiking or bicycle club in the future.
But I should still try this now?
Of course.
There are no guarantees
and one of the major aspects of college is going out and trying new things.

1347,Lecture: The flight of the Bumblebee,B2,lecture-the-flight-of-the-bumblebee,50,"Okay!
So, today I am going to talk about the flight of the bumblebee.
Many years ago, scientists believed that the flight of the bumblebee defied the law of physics.
They took the weight of a bumblebee and its wing area into account and did some calculations.
They found, from an aerodynamic point of the view,
the way a bumblebee flies doesn't make any sense.
In fact, scientists believed that bumblebees couldn't even fly.
That's why there is a famous quote, ‚ÄúAerodynamically, the bumblebee shouldn't be able to fly"",
""but the bumblebee doesn't know it so it goes on flying anyway‚Äù.
Now you must be wondering how come we still see bumblebees flying around amidst the flowers.
It turned out that scientists were wrong.
The big misconception about bumblebee flight is the belief that bumblebees flap their wings up and down.
In addition, the fluid dynamics behind the flight of a bumblebee are different from those that allow a plane to fly.
An airplane's wing forces air down,
which in turn pushes its wing upward.
For bumblebees, it isn't so simple.
They flap their wings back and forth.
As a bumblebee takes flight,
the angle to the wing creates vortices in the air like small hurricanes.
The eyes of those vortices have lower pressure than the surrounding air and suck the wing upwards.
This is what gives the bumblebee the extra bit of lift it needs to buzz around from flower to flower.
It's just like if you move a spoon through a cup of coffee;
you'll see the flow swirl around the sharp edge.
If you move the spoon quickly,
you'll actually see a dimple at the center of the vortex caused by the lower pressure.
Amazing, right?
But this is not what amazes me the most.
What I am most intrigued by is how these bees are able to find the most efficient route between flowers.
You see, bumblebees foraging for nectar in flowers are like salesmen traveling between towns.
Both seek the optimal route to minimize their travel costs.
In order to find out how they achieve this,
a team of researchers conducted an experiment.
They trained the bees to forage nectar from five blue artificial flowers.
Each artificial flower had a yellow landing platform and a single drop of sucrose,
just enough to fill one-fifth of a bumblebee's tank capacity.
This ensured that the bees would visit all five flowers on each foraging route.
The researchers arranged the flowers in a pentagon and spaced them 50 meters apart.
This distance is more than three times as far as bumblebees can see,
so the bees must actively fly around to locate their next target.
A motion-triggered Webcam was attached to each flower to record the bees' visits.
Then, every day for a month, each bee was freed to forage for 7 hours.
At first, the bumblebees visited the flower nearest to their nest,
and then the next closest flower.
It appeared that the bees kept track- that is, they remembered -
the total distance traveled on each foraging trip.
They tried new routes to increase their efficiency,
and if a route was shorter, they used this route instead.
If not, they abandoned it.
As their experience increased,
the bumblebees were able to select the most efficient path to visit the flowers.

1348,Lecture: Antikythera Mechanism,C1,lecture-antikythera-mechanism,54,"Now we've got a few minutes before we leave for today. So I'll touch on an interesting subject.
More than a hundred years ago
an extraordinary mechanism was found by sponge divers at the bottom of the sea near the island of Antikythera.
It astonished the whole international community of experts on the ancient world.
Was it an astrolabe? Or Was it an an astronomical clock?
For decades, scientific investigation failed to yield much light and relied more on imagination than the facts.
However research over the last half century has begun to reveal its secrets.
The machine dates from around the end of the 2nd century B.C.
and is the most sophisticated mechanism known from the ancient world.
It is now known as the Antikythera mechanism.
Now, when the Antikythera Mechanism was found, it was submerged in a shipwreck.
Of course, it was in terrible condition, some parts entirely corroded away.
It was a fairly small device, about the size of a shoebox,
a meticulous mesh of gears within a wooden shell.
There were rotating dials and other markings on the top,
with words and icons showing the Sun and moon,
and different points of reference in the stars.
In other words, this was a device that could track the phases of the moon.
This kind of thing would be invaluable during a ship's journey at sea.
Since then, scientists have been carefully looking at the device for clues on where and when it was made,
and they concluded that it dated back to somewhere between 150 and 100 BCE.
In other words, it was about a 50 year time span it could have been invented and used within.
So! this was an important breakthrough in the field of archaeology...
because before we found the Antikythera Mechanism,
the only evidence we could find of a similar star-tracking devices was a thousand years earlier.
Now, as I just said earlier,
when the Antikythera Mechanism was found, it was entirely corroded away.
This is because the Antikythera Mechanism is made entirely of bronze.
Well... this would make sense as bronze was widely used in Greece back then.
In fact, because bronze was malleable,
it was easy to melt the the metal down into bronze coins,
which was used as money in Greece.
Okay! Back to where I said about the Antikythera Mechanism being made of bronze.
You see.. Bronze easily corrodes underwater,
so after spending nearly 2,000 years at the bottom of the sea,
symbols, of course, were rubbed down to almost nothing by water and silt,
and the gears, as you can imagine...
had been crusted together into one mass with rust and other deposits.
So, cleaning it was an uphill battle, and never completely successful.
We could really only get a solid idea of how many gears were laid out
after using gamma-rays to see inside,
kind of similar to the way X-rays are used to see your bones.
So! After scanning the insides,
we found an incredibly complex creation.
The plethora of gears didn't only track the phases of the moon,
The Antikythera Mechanism also kept track of the lunar year and the solar year.
In addition, they ticked to align with the earth's own rotation,
and could accurately predict when an eclipse would happen.
This is all amazing,
but the one particularly mind-blowing trait of this device was that it was so incredibly precise
that it actually accounted for an irregularity in our moon's orbit
that would require some extremely complex math to replicate in a mechanical device.
I suppose I could say the Antikythera Mechanism is an amazing piece of engineering
that revolutionized the archaeological community.

1349,Lecture: Archimedes Palimpsest,C1,lecture-archimedes-palimpsest,62,"So we've been talking about different techniques of preserving artifacts.
Now I'd like to talk about an interesting case study
on the preservation of an artifact called the Palimpsest of Archimedes.
I'm sure you've heard of Archimedes,
one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity.
He lived more than 2,000 years ago in Greece.
He was regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of history.
He figured out how to mathematically calculate the surface area and volume of a sphere,
and an accurate approximation of pi.
Unfortunately, not much of his work survived the passage of time.
He originally printed his findings on papyrus,
which was a processed and woven river reed fiber.
This material greatly decayed over time,
and his original scrolls were mostly lost.
What had survived had been brilliant.
Then, in 1906, a Palimpsest of Archimedes' writing was discovered.
Excuse me! Professor!
What is a Palimpsest?
Well, Parchment is made of animal skins that had been stretched tightly and dried.
Scholars used to take parchment that already had writing,
then wash it off with milk and write over the now-clean surface.
You have to understand that back then paper was uncommon for writing.
Instead, parchment was used for all the writing.
Okay!
Now, the interesting thing is that,
after the ink had been sitting on parchment for a long enough time, it soaks in.
And as the parchment aged, it dehydrated, making it lose much of its flexibility.
However, that extra drying time also made any captured inks within the skin rise to the surface.
So, seven hundred years later,
someone washed away a log of Archimedes' greatest work,
the letters and diagrams reappeared under the new letters.
It is now known as ‚ÄúThe Archimedes Palimpsest‚Äù,
and is probably by far the most important palimpsest anyone has found.
It contains the only known existing copy of Archimedes' finest work.
In it, he shows how mathematics can be applied to physical reasoning.
In 1906, the palimpsest was put on auction,
selling for 2 million dollars.
Luckily, it was not tucked away in a private collection.
The buyer agreed to have experts restore every single word Archimedes had written.
Now, his words can be shared with the world.
Unfortunately, we still have some problems with this Palimpsest.
Can anyone guess what they are?
Yes. Susan!
Well, it's been in storage for a long time,
probably not getting the proper care.
It's probably super crumbly, or moldy.
Exactly.
Some of it's moldy, some of it's been attacked by bugs.
The poor thing really went through the ringer.
On top of that, there is another problem with this Palimpsest.
Yes! John?
The letters on it aren't readable?
Essentially, yes.
Many archaeologists have used a variety of techniques such as Ultraviolet light
to try to make the letters more legible, but that didn't always work.
Fortunately, a physicist stepped forward - Bergman.
This guy was doing research on the iron within spinach leaves.
He proposed an idea that was very similar to how he was looking at iron in spinach.
He realized that the iron in the ancient ink would display
if exposed to a certain X-ray imaging method,
except for small portions of the text that couldn't be deciphered.
Now, with this technique, much of Archimedes' texts and drawings were revealed.

1350,Lecture: Rosetta Stone,C1,lecture-rosetta-stone,45,"Alright! Let's look at Egyptian Hieroglyphs.
Egyptian Hieroglyphs are the ancient Egyptian writings
found in ancient Egypt on walls, monuments and on the inside and outside of temples.
Hieroglyphic writing ended abruptly about 1600 years ago,
and it mystified a lot of people in the study of Egyptian artifacts and archaeology for many many centuries.
In 1799, a French soldier discovers a black basalt slab
inscribed with ancient Egyptian writing near the town of Rosetta.
The Rosetta Stone is arguably the most famous archaeological artifact ever discovered.
It is written in three scripts being used in Egypt.
The first was hieroglyphic which was the script used for important or religious documents.
The second was demotic which was the common script of Egypt
and was used for more mundane matters like administrative documents.
The third was Greek which was the language of the rulers of Egypt at that time.
Now here is an important part to remember:
Hieroglyphic and the demotic were replaced by Coptic scripts,
and eventually, the Arabic language replaced Coptic,
and this cut off the linguistic link between ancient and modern Egypt
and make it difficult for scholars to decipher.
Thomas Young, an English scholar,
was the first to seriously attempt to decipher the symbols on the Rosetta Stone.
He suspected that the hieroglyphs were phonetic symbols,
that they represented its sounds rather than pictures.
Until then, all scholars assumed that hieroglyphs were pictographs,
that they symbolize objects or concepts.
Thomas Young focused his attention on one set of hieroglyphs
that he thought would probably spell out a single word: the name of a King or Queen.
He guessed that the symbols represented the name of the early Egyptian ruler - Ptolemy,
since Ptolemy was also written in Greek on the stone and was indeed a Greek name.
And Young did actually prove that these hieroglyphs represented sounds rather than whole words.
However, he finally dismissed his own findings as an anomaly
because the Ptolemaic dynasty was Greek, not Egyptian.
In other words, he figured it was an exception to the rule.
It was phonetic because it was Greek, not Egyptian.
How else could an Egyptian depict a Greek name other than spell it out?
It wasn't until 1822
that another scholar called Champollion made a breakthrough in the decipherment of the Rosetta hieroglyphs,
showing that the Egyptian writing system was a combination of phonetic and ideographic signs.
You see, unlike any of the other scholars who had tried to crack the code,
Champollion could read both Greek and Coptic.
He was able to figure out what the seven demotic signs in Coptic were.
By looking at how these signs were used in Coptic,
he was able to work out what they stood for.
Then he began tracing these demotic signs back to hieroglyphic signs.
By working out what some hieroglyphs stood for,
he could make educated guesses about what the other hieroglyphs stood for.

1351,Lecture: The Botai People,B2,lecture-the-botai-people,55,"We've recently gone over a number of ancient societies,
and looked at how they tamed animals like chickens or cows for food and other resources.
Today we'll be focusing on the Botai people.
The Botai people lived in central Asia,
what is now northern Kazakhstan, over 5000 years ago.
Everything we know about this ancient culture comes from three rich archaeological digs.
Unlike many western cultures at the time,
the Botai people were not nomadic,
but they didn't tend to farms or agriculture like many other sedentary peoples.
They built villages with hundreds of homes,
and we have a lot of evidence that they domesticated horses to aid them in their daily lives.
This would make sense,
because horses were native to the area,
and could withstand the rough climate.
Without a need for heated barns or terribly rich food,
the Botai people could rely on these horses for clothing, food, and transportation.
This also allowed them to settle, instead of being nomadic.
Were the Botai people the first ones to domesticate a horse?
No, horses had been domesticated a bit earlier,
and historians believe it was to the northeast, further into Russia,
where the first domesticated horses originated.
However, it's quite feasible that those people migrated southeast into what is now Kazakhstan,
either forming these Botai people or passing on their methods.
Couldn't the horse have just been hunted and killed?
How do we know the bones mean the horses were domesticated?
Like most history, there's no real way to be 100% certain.
However, we can deduce from the tools around the encampment,
that they kept some sort of large livestock.
We also found writing indicating that they drank milk.
Where would they get milk, if not from domesticated animals?
How would you milk a wild horse?
They'd probably kick you and run away.
The fact that we found horse bones in the encampment, and not other types of livestock,
suggests strongly that they had been domesticating the animals for years.
Unlike dogs, horses do not show signs of domestication very strongly.
Physically, at least.
Ancient horse bones themselves won't tell us much about domestication,
they won't have changed significantly enough from modern horse bone structure.
We have found, however, structures in the Botai villages that strongly resemble corrals or pens.
Not long ago, scientists took soil samples
and concluded that the earth inside those pens
had phosphorus concentrations ten times higher than the baseline.
What this means, is that large numbers of horses were being held in those pens.
Horse manure, you see, has high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen.
Nitrogen, being an unstable element, can easily wash away or decompose into the soil.
Phosphorus is a bit harder to get rid of, so it builds up in the soil
and leaves easily detectable traces as it fuses with the calcium and iron in the soil.
Since the Botai settlement soil has loads of Phosphorus in it,
we can conclude they had herbivorous livestock of some sort.
Double it up with the bones, and you have some pretty solid proof of horse domestication.
Later on, the Botai people became nomadic again, as they started herding sheep and cattle.
Those two species don't do well in cold environments,
so the Botai people had to travel southward during cold winters,
to make sure their livestock survived.
The kind of food and supplies that they gained by the hard work of travel was worth it, in their eyes.

1352,Lecture: Sauropods,C1,lecture-sauropods,60,"In the past, North America supported a wide variety of enormous creatures.
Between 11,000 and 10,000 B.C.E,
beasts like Mastodons, Giant Sloths and the Mammoth.
I could go on, the list is massive.
Rather suddenly, around 10,000 B.C.E,
all of these enormous beasts had vanished.
They were North American Megafauna, and they were gone.
No one is exactly sure what happened to them, but several theories have been discussed.
Human hunting, is one theory.
The beasts could have been hunted to extinction.
At the time that those animals roamed the continent,
the humans were called the Clovis People.
There is a site in southern california, featuring those people.
Within the site is a number of tools for processing meat,
as well as spear points, fireplaces, and the skeletons of 13 mammoths.
Mammoth bones have also been found at other Clovis People excavation sites.
However, just because they hunted the mammals didn't mean they did so to extinction.
Further evidence to the contrary includes strong hints
that the Clovis people tended to favor plant gathering and small game hunting.
Likewise, similar gatherings of mammoth skeletons have been found at...
what is obviously the site of an ancient natural disaster.
Avalanche, flood, any one of these could kill a large group of them.
Perhaps at the Clovis site mentioned,
the humans only took advantage of the aftermath of a natural disaster before they, too, were claimed.
Another theory is that of severe climate change.
Around 11,000 B.C.E,
humans started settling into areas, instead of being Nomadic hunter-gatherers.
The world was moving into one of its interglacial periods, or the warm times between Ice Ages.
Due to carbon dioxide and methane buildups in the atmosphere,
the entire world was insulated and warmed up significantly.
With warmer weathers, animals built to live in extreme colds would suffer stress in the heat,
and die from heat-stroke or dehydration.
Their physiology simply couldn't cope.
We take for granted that there are tropical zones near the equator,
grasslands, woodlands, and finally tundra as you move northward.
During Ice Age periods, the plants would have all been fairly mixed together, with high plant diversity in any one area.
With warmer climates, plants expanded outward,
survived as best they could, and resulted in more plant volume,
but less diversity in each area.
Another theory in addition to the heat-stroke one
is that large animals like our Megafauna could not get the plant diversity needed for their large diets,
and died of malnutrition.
While that may seem like a sound theory,
it does have one fatal flaw:
The world goes through cycles like this regularly,
and the last Ice-Age followed by a interglacial period had no mass extinction.
An article was recently published about an archeologist using the latest technology to try and solve this puzzle.
He scripted a computer program that would simulate the effects of certain environmental changes on a mammoth.
For example, if a drought persisted for a dozen years,
or hunters culled ten percent of the total mammoth population,
what would happen?
While no solid conclusion was made, he did have this to say:
""Hunters killing off every mammoth was not needed to push them toward extinction"".
Huge creatures like elephants and, by extension, mammoths, reproduce very slowly.
The man created a simulation where humans killed off a few young females from the herd,
and gave them some added environmental stress.
The simulated mammoth herd all died within a few decades.
For now, scientists suspect a mixture of hunting and changing climate would have done the trick to smother these mighty beasts.
Unfortunately, we still do not have a concrete answer,
and no amount of computer simulations will replace finding solid evidence.

1353,Lecture: Father of American Anthropology,C1,lecture-father-of-american-anthropology,66,"In this lecture series, we're going to look at the most prominent anthropologist - Franz Uri Boas,
a German Anthropologist born in 1858,
who later came to live in America and is generally known as the ""Father of American Anthropology"".
Before we can consider Boas's contribution,
we need to look at the state anthropology was in before he came onto the scene.
Although there was some serious work being done in anthropology at the time,
the field was heavily peopled with untrained adventurers and armchair philosophers.
They used small scraps of information,
haphazardly gathered and riddled with bias,
to back up the point they wanted to make.
Boas's background countered this.
His parents held a disdain for dogma,
which meant that Boas was free to question different beliefs unhindered.
He was attracted to the natural sciences.
As he grew older, he did more rigorous studies and experiments,
and studied mathematics, physics and geography.
What put him on the anthropological track was a geographic expedition to the arctic
that he took in 1883.
This background was, I think it's fair to say,
fundamental with regards to what Boas brought to the field,
because he introduced methodology and scientific method to the field.
He believed that you could only formulate theories and conclusions
after thorough and rigorous collection of data,
and the examination of hard evidence.
One of Boas's main contributions to anthropological thought
was his rejection of the evolutionary approach to culture.
This approach assumed that all societies progressed through certain technological and cultural stages,
in hierarchical form, until they reached the peak - the zenith -
which of course was the Western-European culture.
According to Boas, this was all bunkum.
There was no process towards a so-called higher form of culture.
Each society, he said, was uniquely adapted to the set of circumstances in which it had arisen.
Each was the product of a unique history.
His ideas paralleled those of Charles Darwin,
whose own conception of evolution was that change occurred in response to pressures and opportunities.
This idea was what shaped Boas's work in museums,
for which he was, at first heavily criticised.
At the time, museums were laid out in this way -
cultures considered primitive were set out first,
and then gradually more so-called advanced or higher cultures were set out in progression.
But Boas rejected that.
He insisted that museums focus on the cultural proximity of the groups in question.
Boas also did a lot of work to destroy preconceived ideas of racism.
Racial anthropologists of the day were under the impression that human behaviour was determined by an innate disposition.
Boas worked to disprove this,
asserting that behaviour was the result of social learning.
He also worked on physiological preconceptions.
At the time, it was believed that head shape was a racial trait.
Presumably they were under the impression that Western Europeans naturally had larger brains
and so were more intelligent,
but Boas conducted a series of groundbreaking studies of skeletal anatomy
to prove that head shape and size was highly malleable,
and depended on environmental factors such as health and nutrition.
For Boas, the object of anthropology was to understand how their experiences,
their environment, and their social leaning led people to understand and interact with the world in different ways.
And to do this, you couldn't just observe them from a distance through the eyes of your own culture.
You needed to look at a whole range of things such as mythology, religion,
physical appearance, and so on.
To do this, anthropologists needed to go on location,
and undertake an intense survey that cataloged all these different elements.
As the burden of the task of studying culture grew,
anthropology became divided into four distinct parts:
human evolution, archaeology, language, and culture.
In short, Boas left behind a considerable legacy to the field of anthropology,
in terms of his scientific methodology, his cultural relativism
and his tireless efforts to end racial bigotry and oppression.

1354,Lecture: Ancient Writings on Mathematics,C2,lecture-ancient-writings-on-mathematics,51,"In the beginning, all scripts were hand-made.
I'm referring to Europe during the Middle Ages.
Certainly not the beginning of all things, but it's where we're starting today.
Books, scrolls, notes, letters to the king,
they were all penned by hand, usually on parchment with a quill and ink.
Parchment is an animal skin that had been stretched thin and dried under tension.
This treatment of a hide will make it very thin, flexible, and easy to write on and transport.
During the 1400's, papers became the more commonly used material for books in Europe,
but before that, it was parchment.
Parchment is durable, unlike paper, and could be reused.
Reusability was nice because writing supplies were in short supply and were quite valuable.
It was fairly common for religious leaders to be the ones who produced written work.
To be able to read, let alone write, one had to either be born high-class,
a merchant, involved in your local religion or both very lucky and very hard-working.
Anyway, scribes could re-use parchment by rubbing away the ink from parchment previously used for less important manuscripts.
Using the parchment again was called Palimpsest.
The original text on a Palimpsest could sometimes be recovered.
There were two ways to remove the ink to reuse parchment.
The first is to simply scrape away the ink with something abrasive.
This removes a layer or two of parchment as well,
and it completely wiped out any writing that could have been on them.
However, before that method became widespread,
the original ink was normally washed away in a bath of milk.
This technique removed the letters, but over time they might reappear.
Actually, it might reappear with such clarity
that scholars would be able to make out and translate the original text
from where it laid under the new text.
One of the most notorious examples is the Archimedes' palimpsest.
Archimedes is a fairly well-known name at this point.
He is heralded by many as one of the greatest Mathematicians who ever lived.
Unfortunately, he lived in Greece around 200 B.C.E.
and many of his scholarly works have been lost,
most devastatingly, his keystone work called ‚ÄúThe Method‚Äù.
In 1998, just 17 years ago,
a book of prayers from that time period was sold for millions of dollars -
far more than one would normally pay for a damaged, 12th century book at an art auction.
Sure, it may have been beautifully penned, but why so costly?
Well, it had been discovered that the book was a palimpsest,
and under the prayers on the surface was a manually penned script
of Mathematical theorems and diagrams from Archimedes himself.
His writings were originally on papyrus,
which is a form of paper made from woven and processed river reeds.
Around the 10th century, a scribe must have made a copy on parchment of some of his texts and diagrams.
Their logs included what had long been lost to time, the entirety of ‚ÄúThe Method‚Äù.
In the 12th century, about 200 years later,
the animal-skin log of Archimedes' most important work was cleaned with milk and used again to write down prayers.
The page, the parchment itself was preserved well enough for the original ink to reappear after hundreds of years.
It wasn't until 1906 that the prayer book was found by a scholar
who could realize it was a palimpsest.
Upon further analysis, that resurfaced layer of text could only be ‚ÄúThe Method‚Äù.
The greatest mathematician's finest work had finally been discovered after nearly 6 centuries, for the first time.

1355,Lecture: Hexagonal House,C1,lecture-hexagonal-house,69,"If you remember, last week we started to discuss architecture in the residential United States.
Today we'll narrow in on that, focusing on a few architects
who made some significant changes to the 19th century residential architecture.
It's worth mentioning that designers at the time likely faced a lot of scrutiny
both from their peers and from the public at large.
A bit of discouragement probably came along with that.
Many thought that designs should not necessarily be utilitarian, but a status symbol
or way to show off your sensibilities.
Designing was looked upon like more of an art than a science.
There's actually a quote I have here,
from an issue of a journal called The American Architect and Building News, from 1876.
Here, I'll read it to you, and I want you to keep it in mind as we progress with the lesson.
They said that ‚Äúthe planning of houses isn't architecture at all‚Äù!
And now we arrive at Harriet Morrison Irwin.
Irwin was born in North Carolina,
when there weren't a lot of architects hailing from the southern United States.
Born in 1828, she also entered a field where very few women dared walk.
A pretty exceptional case, Irwin had not received any formal education to be an architect.
She actually studied literature.
Jane? Would you like to add something?
Yeah, so, she just had crazy awesome architecture instincts or something?
Essentially, yes.
She had spent several years writing,
but found she had a good mind for engineering and math,
and ended up studying it a lot on her own time.
We actually studied one of her favorite authors in the field of architecture,
the British critic John Ruskin.
Do you remember what Ruskin's main theme was?
Oh, I think It was something about nature?
Like, he thought that people who lived close to nature would have better health, both mental and physical.
Exactly right.
So, Harriet really enjoyed Ruskin's writing,
and those ideas bloomed into a few of her own.
At that point, her push into architecture was fairly small,
but caused a bit of an interested stir.
Her first contribution was a house designed with a hexagonal shape.
Six sides, instead of the standard four.
She thought the important thing about the house was that the rooms were arranged around a central chimney.
This central chimney, as you can imagine, provided heat in the winter to each of the six rooms equally.
It also had an interesting flip for the summer.
Harriet made sure there were windows on every outside wall,
to provide each room with natural lighting and a view of the outdoors.
These doubled in the summer, when one could open the windows and doors,
combined with the chimney floo and produce a noticeable breeze.
So she used Ruskin's nature thing,
and made an open little house that could feel open and fresh.
Correct!
Likewise, having a fireplace in every room would have meant possible smoke or 'dirty air' in the rooms,
and a lot of cleaning.
With the open windows and airflow sweeping in toward the center,
all the dust or smoke would be pulled up and out of the house.
Her house also didn't have a main entrance, or many hallways.
There were a few doors spread around the outside walls, providing easy access to the outdoors.
Another advantage to this kind of layout is the cleaning style.
Think about it,
what part of a room is the hardest to clean with a broom?
Probably the edges of a room.
Under a desk, or in a corner.
Exactly.
Now, I have a strong feeling that, due to the times, biographers weren't as kind as they could have been.
I feel they may have downplayed her designs,
and didn't talk about how truly ingenious and creative this idea had been.
If Margaret had first designed this same house in today's times,
architects would be praising her name from the rooftops.
Well, that may be a bit exaggerated.
Anyway, three of Irwin's hexagon designed houses were created during her lifetime.
In 1869, Irwin received a patent for architectural design,
the first woman in the history of the United States to do so.
That kind of remarkable achievement speaks for itself, if you ask me.

1356,Lecture: Epic theaters,C1,lecture-epic-theaters,55,"Good afternoon, everyone.
As you know, this set of lectures will look at various theatrical movements of the twentieth century.
And today, we will be looking at a theatrical movement arising in the early to mid-20th century namely Epic Theater.
Now, to understand what is unique about Epic Theater,
we need to first look at the term Naturalistic Theater.
Remember last week when we talked about Naturalism.
We learned that Naturalism is a movement in European drama
and theater that developed in the late 19th and 20th centuries.
It refers to theater that attempts to create an illusion of reality
through a range of dramatic and theatrical strategies.
As a matter of fact, in Naturalistic Theater,
the audience empathizes with the lives of the characters onstage.
The audience forgets their own lives for a while and escapes into the lives of the actors.
When Naturalistic Theater was at its height,
one theatrical practitioner named Bertolt Brecht wanted to use it as a force for change.
Brecht wanted to make his audience think.
He believed that theater should be capable of provoking social change
while still providing entertainment.
For example, in Naturalistic Theater, when an audience cries for a character
or feels emotion through the events happening to them,
it's called ‚Äúcatharsis‚Äù.
Brecht was against ‚Äúcatharsis‚Äù.
He believed that while the audience believed in the action onstage
and became emotionally involved,
they lost the ability to think and to judge.
He wanted his audiences to remain objective and distant from emotional involvement
so that they could make rational judgements about any social comment or issues in his work.
His kind of theater was called Epic Theater
and the act of distancing the audience from emotional involvement
is called the Verfremdungseffekt or alienation effect.
To achieve the alienation effect, Brecht used a range of theatrical devices or techniques
so that the audience was reminded throughout the performance that they were watching theater.
First, narration is used to remind the audience that they're watching a presentation of a story.
Sometimes the narrator will tell us what happens in the story before it's happened.
This is a good way of making sure that the audience doesn't become too emotionally involved in the upcoming action.
Second, a placard is used.
A placard is a sign or additional piece of written information presented on stage.
Using placards might be as simple as holding up a card, a banner or a slideshow.
In the musical, Miss Saigon, for example,
a highly effective slideshow is used to demonstrate the loss of lives in the Vietnam War.
Third, a montage effect is achieved.
As we learned in Chapter 4: ‚ÄúMovie Editing Introduction‚Äù,
a montage is a technique in film editing
in which a series of short shots are edited into a sequence to condense space, time, and information.
Brecht consciously borrowed the idea from this.
In Epic Theater, each scene is treated as an episode
and is self-contained in the story.
The events of an episode are not necessarily a result of the preceding episode.
This juxtaposition of scenes employing multiple locations and time frames creates a montage effect.
Of course, there are many other techniques involving lighting, gesture and space
used to achieve the alienation effect.
Instead, I'd like everyone to do some research on Epic Theater techniques and...
write a short essay about these techniques.
Next time, we'll share your essays and discuss the additional techniques
that attribute to the alienation effect.

1357,Lecture: Modern Dance,C1,lecture-modern-dance,58,"So! Last week, we talked about Ballet.
As you know, ballet, classical ballet, is based on formalized movements that are very strictly measured.
Specific positioning of the arms, feet head and body are among them.
Today we'll be moving on into theatrical dance, better known as modern dance.
It started evolving into being in the late nineteenth century.
In general, audiences were excited to see this new style, and approved of it.
However, the dance was also seen as fairly radical for its time.
Yes? Ron?
How would it be radical?
Well, think about this.
If you compare it to classical music versus modern music.
The newer art forms are less standardized,
more experimental and full of improvisation.
Just like back when Jazz started becoming popular,
many community leaders spoke out against the music style,
saying that children would be led to a life of sin through listening to it.
Oddly enough, those same phrases were repeated when Rock and Roll became a big hit among the youth.
Okay! So basically this stereotype happened to modern dance as well.
Modern dancers tried to show emotions and movement within the music itself,
demonstrating with their bodies and trying to convey those emotions to the viewers.
In comparison, classical ballet requires those emotions to be told through strictly formalized movements.
So, how was modern dance created?
Well, Isadora Duncan was the innovator of modern dance.
She was born in 1878, and briefly studied ballet as a child.
She found it too restrictive, not creative enough.
She quickly grew tired of the rigorous training into forms, and developed her own style called free dance.
By age fourteen, she had started a class to teach young children her style,
organizing recitals with them.
Now, her early technique was based on the natural forms of children as they run, skip and gesture when they tell stories.
It also incorporated the movements of nature,
like trees swaying in the wind or stones being tumbled as a wave crashes upon them.
Her gestures were expressive and emotional.
While ballerinas had to wear their hair up in a tight bun,
not to distract from their forms,
Duncan wore hers loose and long.
Instead of fluffy short skirts and painful toe shoes,
she'd wear flowing tunics and would dance gracefully barefoot‚Ä¶
and this was something audiences had never seen before,
and they loved it.
Now, a little interesting story about her.
When she was younger but still in her career,
Duncan attended a ballet concert, led by the famous ballerina, Ana Pavlova.
Interested in knowing a dancer so different than herself,
Pavlova invited Duncan to a practice as an observer.
Duncan accepted, and was horrified at what she saw.
The ballerinas practiced on tiptoes for hours, and their feet were deeply bruised by toe shoes.
The movements they practiced, she said, seemed painful and possibly harmful.
After the practice, Duncan publicly announced she thought ballet was a form of acrobatics,
a ‚Äúcomplicated and excruciating mechanism‚Äù.
Now, we must know that back then, Russian ballerinas were very well-loved by their people,
and to see a woman dancing so unlike them really didn't play to their tastes at all.
Not to mention, her announcement must have rubbed them the wrong way.
They criticized her harshly,
saying her dance was closer to childish pantomiming than actual dance.
Still, it didn't bother her very much,
and she continued to dance for the majority of her adult life.
Still, their harsh critique and her denouncing words
left a deep chasm and rivalry between ballerinas and modern dancers for many years.

1358,Lecture: History of Violins,C1,lecture-history-of-violins,75,"Okay! Let's continue our discussions of music instruments.
Musical instruments have evolved over time,
being tweaked in design or in different materials in order to create the richest sound and greatest acoustical properties.
Professional musicians in particular are very specific in how they want their instruments.
They want their instrument to be able to deeply express the intent of the composer and player,
which would in turn create a more enjoyable experience for the audience.
However, many audience members at orchestras or band concerts
don't really know how important the instrument itself is to a good performance.
Think about it.
At the last concert you attended, what was going through your mind when you applauded?
Was it how the lyrics blew you away?
Were you showing appreciation for the skill and technical finesse that must have taken years of practice to be perfect?
What about the violin?
Some people may feel excited because it looks like their own instrument,
and have hope that their own strings could one day produce a melody with such skill.
However, what happens if the same musician plays a melody on another instrument?
One which isn't well tuned, or that's been weathered by improper care.
Think about this..
What if they played the original with genuine catgut strings,
and the second version was played on metal coil strings?
I'm sure you can imagine what would sound richer, truer to the intent of the player.
But why would one instrument sound better, even if they appear the same?
Well, let's look at an intriguing case, about an amazing line of violins made in Northern Italy.
They originated from the city of Cremona, between the late 1600's and early 1700's.
Now, those violins were considered to be the best in the entire world.
The sound they produce, their aesthetic, the way they can be held, it's nearly perfect.
However, the violin-makers back then weren't more skilled than the ones today.
In fact, today's violin-makers can replicate Cremonese violins pretty much perfectly.
Dimensions, string tension, how sanded down the fingerboard was,
no detail was left out.
However, the replicas still can't live up to the sound quality of the original.
Why is that?
Well, for a while people thought that it was the varnish being used to seal the wood,
and that the Cremonese violins had special varnish that made them sing when played.
Chemical analysis showed this wasn't so.
They used ordinary furniture polish.
So! Recently, a scientist took a shaving from one of the old, priceless violins
and discovered something interesting.
The wood has a unique density pattern.
From that, today's violin makers were able to further perfect their own designs and replicas.
Yes! Eunice?
But what was so special about the wood's density?
Well...
Density is determined by how trees grow.
Old trees that live in areas with dramatically changing seasons
will grow quickly in the springtime, and slow down drastically in the fall and winter.
Early, fast growth results in slightly more porous wood.
Later, slow growth on the other hand, is much denser and less porous.
From this change in growth, trees will show rings in their center.
When cut down, darker wood is dense, lighter wood is porous
and the change is called density differential.
So! Variation in the wood's density will affect the sound that an instrument can make.
The sound will become a bit muffled in porous wood.
When scientists took a close look at the shaving piece from the Cremonese violin,
they found no differential.
The density of the wood was almost exactly the same throughout.
Meanwhile, modern violins often had a great difference in density variation,
which would create lovely staining patterns across the wood.
Interestingly, Northern Italy is not in the tropics,
and should have a fairly strong change in seasons.
During the time when Cremonese violins were made,
Europe was going through a mini ice age,
a period of years where the summers were significantly cooler than normal.
Now, because of this, trees grew at about the same rate throughout the year,
resulting in a density differential that was relatively small.
Okay! But how would someone replicate that kind of environment?
Well, they didn't grow a bunch of trees in a greenhouse.
Instead, a scientist found out how to process wood to force the properties to resemble Cremonese wood.
He exposed it to a type of fungus, a mushroom.
Normal fungus decomposes organic matter,
breaking it down into mulch and eventually dirt.
This particular species will only eat away at certain layers of wood, leaving others alone.
Using this fungus, the scientist was able to artificially remove unwanted layers,
and lower the density differential.
This technique allowed violin-makers to create violins that more closely resemble the rich sound that Cremonese violins can make.

1359,Lecture: History of Film,B2,lecture-history-of-film,65,"So, today we are going to talk a little bit about the history of film.
Contrary to what most children think today,
there've not always been movies‚Ä¶..
Can you imagine a world where you can't pay money to see the most recent 3D movie,
or a color film at the local 1-dollar theatre?
Yeah, No thank you‚Ä¶..
The history of film began in the late 1800's, with the invention of the first motion-picture cameras
and the establishment of the first film production companies and cinemas.
These were not your average modern movie companies.
So where did it all begin?
Who was it that thought to create film so that things could be photographed in movement?
When we look way back at the first film experiment,
it takes us back to 1877‚Ä¶..
Edward Muybridge successfully photographed a horse named Sallie Gardner
in fast motion using a series of 24 stereoscopic cameras,
which was basically a camera with two lenses next to each other
to take pictures one right after the other.
The main purpose of the exercise was to determine whether a running horse ever had all four legs lifted off the ground at once.
The cameras were arranged along a track parallel to the horse's,
and each of the camera shutters was controlled by a tripwire that went off as the horse ran by.
So! They were 21 inches apart to cover the 20 feet taken by the horse stride,
taking pictures at one thousandth of a second.
Photographic series like these were a primitive motion picture.
Okay, awesome, so who tried it next?
The second experimental film, Roundhay Garden Scene, filmed by Louis Le Prince in 1888,
is now known as the earliest surviving motion picture.
By modern standards it's barely a home-video
as its runtime is just over two seconds and only shows a few people walking through a garden.
From there, movies were slow to take off and slow to develop into the epic entertainment we know today.
From then on, films were initially shown as a novelty in special venues,
where they were an exhibition in variety theatres, or, presented by traveling showmen in tent theatres,
which they took around to the fairs in country towns.
Films were mostly silent films at that time
because matching the image with sound was not technically possible.
No practical method for recording and playing sound was designed until 1923,
so, for the first thirty years of their history, movies were silent.
However, they were accompanied by live musicians,
and sometimes sound effects, and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist.
In the end, the mouths moved but no sound came out from the film itself.
That advancement in technology would take quite a while to perfect.
So now, we already know that technology was nowhere near the state it's at right now,
so how did they get all the shots for the movies?
The first movie cameras were fastened directly to the head of their tripod or other support,
often times leveled with some crude janky method.
The earliest movie cameras were thus effectively fixed during the course of the shot,
and hence the first camera movements were the result of mounting a camera on a moving vehicle.
Something like a primitive Gopro.
But around the early 1900s
movie producers began getting very creative with their films,
mounting cameras on rotating platforms,
introducing artificial lighting features,
and generating longer plot lines.
In this way, through technological advancement and creative ambition,
the movies were born.
Fairly quickly, producers were making movies that were as long as two and a half hours.
Imagine, two and half hours of silent voices, no CGI, no explosions.
They expanded to filming the news,
building large studios, and playing up personalities,
creating the first film stars.
Circumstances surrounding some of the more successful companies, who happened to be based in Los Angeles
led to an isolated market in that area,
the birth of Hollywood, and the rest is history.
Try to think about all the changes that have happened in the last century
That have led to what all goes into making a movie now.
Pretty crazy huh?

1360,Lecture: Pinhole Camera,B2,lecture-pinhole-camera,61,"Now, when you think about a camera,
you probably think the most important feature of a camera is the lense,
but back then there was no lense.
So the camera must use different type of technology to take pictures.
The very first ‚Äúcamera‚Äù makes use of a pinhole to project the image
but the resulting projection was upside down.
Because it makes uses of a pinhole, it is known as pinhole camera.
So. as I just said,
a pinhole camera is a simple camera without a lens
and with a single small pinhole‚Ä¶.
It really is just a light-proof box with a small hole in one side.
Light from a scene passes through this single point
and projects an inverted image on the opposite side of the box.
Because a pinhole camera requires a lengthy exposure,
its shutter may be manually operated, as with a flap made of light-proof material to cover and uncover the pinhole.
Typical exposures range from 5 seconds to several hours.
Can you really imagine having to wait hours for a picture?
It seems so strange now considering we can snap a picture and see it immediately in a screen at the back of a digital camera‚Ä¶.
Let's be real for a minute,
with the long exposure time and our fast paced world,
is there really a need for these types of cameras?....
The answer is yes, and this is why‚Ä¶
the most common use of the pinhole camera is to capture the movement of the sun over a long period of time‚Ä¶
and this type of photography is called solargraphy.
The image may be projected onto a translucent screen for real-time viewing
which is popular for observing solar eclipses,
that way you are not harming your retinas looking directly at the sun.‚Ä¶.
Or, to be a bit more technical‚Ä¶
Pinhole devices provide safety for the eyes when viewing solar eclipses
because the event is observed indirectly.
The diminished intensity of the pinhole image being harmless compared with the full glare of the Sun itself.
Okay!
So we know a few more things about this camera,
but where did it start?
As in who created this neat little contraption?
Ibn al-Haytham, way back in the 10th century
wrote about naturally-occurring rudimentary pinhole cameras.
For example, light may travel through the slits of wicker baskets
or the crossing of tree leaves‚Ä¶..
If you think about it, the circular dapples on a forest floor, actually pinhole images of the sun,
can be seen to have a bite taken out of them during partial solar eclipses
opposite to the position of the moon's actual occultation of the sun
because of the inverting effect of pinhole lenses‚Ä¶
It's neat, right?
A natural pinhole camera, indeed.
Alhazen published this idea in the Book of Optics in 1021 AD.
He improved on the camera after realizing that the smaller the pinhole,
the sharper the image, though the less light.
He provides the first clear description for construction of a camera obscura.‚Ä¶..
So next April, when World Pinhole Day is held on the last Sunday,
you can tell people exactly why it is being celebrated.
Today we are going to discuss a camera
that you can not only make from virtually anything but it actually works‚Ä¶.
Sounds a little crazy I am sure, but relax
and let's take a peek into the world of pinhole cameras.‚Ä¶.
A pinhole camera really is one of the simplest ways to get involved with and enjoy photography.
The pinhole camera has existed for more than 500 years
and may even have its place in ancient history‚Ä¶.
Totally different from the cameras we use today,
it requires no lenses.
Pinhole cameras are also a great way to introduce little kids to the joy of photography and the basics of optics.

1361,Lecture: Dada,C1,lecture-dada,71,"Okay! Everyone, flip open your notes and review the artists that we were talking about before class ended last week.
We started our introduction into the Dada movement;
can anyone tell me where it started?
Yes, Jimmy?
Sweden?
No, but I see you're on the right track.
Switzerland, actually, in 1916.
The artists of Zurich, Switzerland decided they didn't really like the traditional point of view at the time,
on reason, beauty, and the western standard of progress.
It was the 18th century, with the First World War in high gear.
A lot of artists saw the chaos around them, the random nonsensical violence and decisions that were being made.
Towns being bombed, wiped off the map,
people suddenly being thrown from their homes as the enemy soldiers marched through them -
it was a time of uncertainty in many people's lives, with the normal safety and security they used to have crumbling around them.
So the artists of Zurich decided that, if that's the way the world was,
then their art should reflect that.
They believed people should approach their art with a mindset of completely rejecting the normal idea of what art was meant to be.
Balance, proportion, beauty...
anything you thought as indicators of ‚Äúgreat art‚Äù should be thrown to the wind.
So, to a Dadaist, classical artwork encompassed thinking that was stale.
For example, the sculpture we examined at the end of class last week.
You couldn't exactly call it beautiful, right?
A stool with a bike on top,
it rather defeats the purpose of both objects, don't you think?
Chaotic, purposeless, a bit ugly; that's the point,
and it has Dada written all over it.
Randomness was another idea that the Dada style embraced.
Life was random, they said, so why shouldn't art be random as well?
Logic, order, they wanted nothing of it.
Check out this slide.
See how it looks essentially like a bunch of colored squares of construction paper thrown at a canvas?
Yeah, that's exactly what happened.
No pre-planned composition, no forethought to where they wanted the eye to be drawn to, or...
what empty space would occur.
Just take a bunch of squares, lay down some glue, and throw it.
That element of random chance was essential to keep in mind,
as the World War and the devastation around them was what really drove this entire movement.
A bomb could strike, a fire could start,
and you could lose everything at any moment.
Everything in the world was up to chance.
Also, the way Dadaists presented their art was an extension of the art style.
Now, what I meant by this is that while normal artwork is presented in museums, or displayed on the street,
Dada work was shown in a more diverse and unconventional fashion.
They turned out more like plays or performances.
Shows, perhaps, would be a good name.
The first shows started in a place called the Cabaret Voltaire,
a performance area whose selling point was the rejection of classical art from a western viewpoint.
It had no operas or plays. It just mixed everything like without a purpose.
To give an example,
it throwed in an instrumental performance right behind a display of paintings,
which was set up after the viewers had watched a man in a robot costume
flailing about for a few minutes.
The Cabaret Voltaire's performances also had something that was relatively unheard of at the time:
Audience participation.
Think about a play you've seen, or an instrumental performance.
Likely, all of the action was self-contained,
happening only on the stage and involving only the people within the story.
It's like a little world that you can view, with a story that builds and completes itself.
The Cabaret Voltaire, on the other hand, thrived with audience participation.
Audience members were practically invited onstage, to dance with the others, or...
to touch the artwork, singing or dancing to the music.
The Dadaists practically eliminated the barrier between the audience and the performers.
So! Each night would have a new feel to it,
a new audience and a new set of performances.
With all the interaction and jumping back and forth between 'viewer' and 'performer',
things got a bit chaotic.
Poetry, paintings, dance, and music all happening across the same stage,
occasionally at the same time.
The Dadaists tried to make their art reflect that chaotic view of reality.
It didn't make sense, there was no order to it,
but wasn't that the point?

1362,Lecture: Action Film,C1,lecture-action-film,69,"So we've been looking at different genres of film over the past few weeks,
and today we're going to look at action film,
specifically discussing its history and characteristics in each era.
As you can see from the first slide,
action films featured historical themes during the 1920s and 1930s.
During this time, many filmmakers drew on history for inspiration,
so we can see that there were a number of action films,
with themes such as the French Revolution and the Roman Empire.
As a matter of fact, they also filmed popular legends, like Robin Hood, King Arthur and so on.
Now I want you to remember that just like any art movement,
the development of film is influenced by social and economic factors,
this is important
because it explains why action films revolved around themes of the second world war during the 1940s and 50s.
In this era, action films have an abundance of war adventures.
The movie Guns of Navarone is an example of this.
The second war also led to action films involving spies.
For example, the movie 'North by Northwest' which was filmed by Alfred Hitchcock,
but keep in mind that North by Northwest is not just a spy film,
it's more than that.
It has that famous perilous scene involving the crop-duster,
which definitely puts it into an action film category.
The famous director Albert R. Broccoli was presumably inspired by this movie,
so, shortly afterwards, he started creating films based on the novels of Ian Fleming,
and made James Bond a household name in the 1960s.
So, as you can see from the second slide,
in the 1960s, James Bond became the epitome of an action hero
and his films became the standard by which all action films are measured.
In these films, he was able to dispatch the villain and his henchmen single-handedly.
The character of the archetypal hero also came through here.
He's a ladies' man, but one who refuses to settle down.
Meanwhile, he's ready with one-liners, puns, and quips,
making him not only handsome and fearless but droll as well.
Because James Bond films depicted all corners of the globe,
Live and Let Die, for example, was partially set in China, and featured Asian martial arts.
Its popularity started to inspire more filmmakers to meld these two genres.
For example, Bruce Lee's 1973 film Enter the Dragon,
Jackie Chan's Rush Hour and Chuck Norris's Good Guys Wear Black to name but a few.
In the 1980s, we had the Star Wars films,
perhaps the most famous action movie series in recent history.
They were also an amalgamation of two genres of film:
action film fused with science fiction.
Hard core Star Wars fans might want to argue against that,
but there's no denying it,
although the earlier films had more sci-fi elements,
like star-ship chases and dog-fights,
the last film in the original trilogy had much more in the way of acrobatic stunts and hand-to-hand combat
and other features that we would generally associate with action films.
Into the 21st century,
one obvious change is the introduction of CGI.
As you can see from the textbook,
the CGI is referred to as computer graphic interface.
This has made action sequences far cheaper and easier to create,
and as a result, scenes that have once have been nigh-on impossible to film can be done quite easily.
However, some critics have said that significant amounts of CGI in a film can lessen its impact on the audience,
and I for one, agree with this.
I think that much of the drama and excitement is lost when filmmakers rely too heavily on the CGI effects.
A second, rather startling change in recent action films
is that we really don't have any action heroes any more.
I mean, which actors do you know who are really known as action heroes these days?
Jason Statham, is one perhaps, or Daniel Craig, the present Bond actor.
But these are rather dramatic, realistic sorts of hero,
a far cry from the previous Bonds who were - well,more fantastical and larger than life.
And that's why some of the popular action heros from the 90s‚Ä¶
Sylvestor Stallone, Bruce Willis, Harrison Ford‚Ä¶
are still, in many ways, going strong.
The Expendables, for example, a recent action film, parodies this aging crop of superstars.
And films like this are possible because no-one else‚Ä¶ um.. well...
no other actors have stepped in to take their place.
The roles just aren't there for them, perhaps because the character of the archetypal action hero is changing.

1363,Lecture: Roman Sculpture,C1,lecture-roman-sculpture,64,"Last week we looked at the art, particularly the sculpture, of Ancient Greece,
and this week, we'll be moving on to the Romans.
And, just some historic background to put all of this into perspective,
Rome conquered Greece in 146 BC,
and the vast Greek empire came under control of the Romans.
And, from an artistic point of view,
Rome inherited and carried forward the Greeks' vast cultural and artistic achievements,
that is to say that they assimilated it into their own culture,
rather than imposing their own artistic values on a new empire,
which tells us something about the Romans‚Ä¶
and, well, how they went about things.
So Greek sculpture formed the basis for the Roman style;
in particular, their bronzes showed a marked similarity.
And, in terms of output, they were just as prolific as their predecessors.
But one thing that stands out as distinctive is that,
where the Greeks tended to be... well‚Ä¶ tended towards idealism and an archetypal perfection,
indeed a very romantic point of view,
the Romans added an element of realism,
such as men at work, and day to day life really‚Ä¶
and this is truly invaluable to us
because it shows us what technologies the Romans had,
which we would have no other evidence of,
because the originals, being made of wood, have rotted away.
I'm talking about things such as saws driven by water-wheels.
Now, keep in mind that we only know about these because of a relief that was found on the side of a miller's sarcophagus,
who, we can assume, used the machine.
Harvesting machines have also been depicted in stone.
Pliny the Elder wrote about these in his work Naturalis Historia,
but we have no visual representation of these apart from the sculptures.
And, another thing we've found out about while studying the sculpture, is their use of color in their sculpture.
Now, I know what you might be thinking right now‚Ä¶ that this is a strange thing to say
because nowadays we see these Roman sculptures, and they're white, pure marble white,
and they look very elegant and striking,
and in many ways, angelic and unearthly‚Ä¶
and it's their lack of color which gives us this impression.
But actually that impression is quite wrong, because originally these statues were in colour,
and those Neo-classical sculptors who aspire to imitate that style‚Ä¶
by creating unadorned marble statues‚Ä¶
have quite got the wrong end of the stick.
We know this, from examining the faded stains and blotches on the surfaces of the sculpture,
we know what the original colors were, and what pigments and waxes they used to obtain them.
Interestingly, we can see that sculptors used different kinds of stone in their work depending on...
what they wanted to achieve.
For a glossy finish, for skin perhaps, they'd use one kind,
and if they wanted a particularly vibrant look, for clothing perhaps,
they'd use a stone with a‚Ä¶ a different absorption capacity.
This attention to detail, when it comes to color,
can tell us a little bit more about Ancient Rome that we didn't know before.
Not just the way they created different colors and effects,
but also what people wore.
A replica of this statue Octavian, the first Roman emperor,
was recently displayed at an exhibition in the Vatican,
painted in the same way as it would have appeared well‚Ä¶ long ago.
And, you can see here in the slide that you can see his scarlet robe,
a red and blue blouse and a bright yellow breastplate.
And here's the original one,
the one that we are more familiar with, which is well...
it just has a different‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ feel to it, wouldn't you agree?
The reproduction looks more cheerful, more vitalized,
but it loses something,
something of the sobriety and dignity that we tend to associate with ancient Rome.
It seems a little more mundane actually.
And, it tells us that the Romans were‚Ä¶ well.. weren't quite so mysterious and...
enigmatic as perhaps we‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ give them credit for.

1364,Lecture: Van Gogh,C1,lecture-van-gogh,50,"So, continuing in our series of important artists,
ones who have really shaped and influenced art today,
we're going to look at Van Gough - Vincent Willem van Gogh,
who was born in 1853
and who died in 1890, at only the age of 37.
Van Gogh began to draw as a child,
and although he drew throughout his youth,
he did not use the medium of paint until his late twenties.
Actually he originally intended to become a pastor,
and even worked as a missionary in a mining regions of Belgium.
It was here where he began to sketch members of the local community,
and you can see on the slide here,
one of his first major works, the Potato Eaters.
You can see that his palette is very somber‚Ä¶ lots of earth tones.
There's none of that vivid coloration that you see in his later work.
Really, not what you'd expect from Van Gogh at all.
Something occurred to make Vincent change his mind regarding where he saw his true path in life,
and he headed to Paris in 1886 to work for an art dealership.
And it makes you wonder what, if anything really, Van Gogh would have contributed to the art world
had he not given up on the devout, spiritual path,
because it wasn't until he came to Paris that he developed his distinctive style.
That said, it seems that he was greatly influenced by the strong sunlight there,
because, as I mentioned before, his work got distinctly more vibrant and flamboyant in that respect.
Two years later, he stayed in Arles,
and it was after that when he developed his highly recognizable style
and created his famous works, like 'Sunflowers' and his self-portrait.
Remember, this is only two years before his death,
so it wasn't until really later on in life that he really came into his own.
Now Van Gogh did suffer considerably from mental health issues,
and art critics love to speculate how his mental health affected his work,
and there's been a tendency over the years to... well.. romanticize this,
by which I mean that it has been proposed that his illness was a considerable creative force,
which is not very sympathetic, given the struggles Van Gogh must have gone through to cope with it.
And other critics see him as this frustrated character,
whose illness brought on bouts of inactivity that prevented him from... well.. concentrating on his art,
but this doesn't quite hang together in my mind,
given his copious productivity during his later years.
That said, there is a general agreement among art historians, however,
that Van Gogh went beyond the superficial, discovering essential truths,
and this seems to echo what was going on in the psychological world at the time,
because while Van Gogh was painting what lay beneath the surface,
Freud was mining the depths of the subconscious.
Shortly before his death, Van Gogh wrote a letter to an acquaintance
saying that, being childless, he viewed his paintings as his progeny.
And indeed, you might say that Van Gogh had a great many heirs,
as a great many artists have adapted elements of Van Gogh's style into their own artwork -
like Willem de Kooning, Howard Hodgkin and Jackson Pollock to name but a few.
So even though he was a little-known artist when he died at the age of 37 from a gunshot wound,
which sadly may well have been self-inflicted,
Vincent Van Gogh is truly a painter who has stood the test of time.

1365,Lecture: Impressionism,C1,lecture-impressionism,83,"So, we've been looking at the different art movements that developed in Europe,
and today we're going to look at Impressionism.
So let's get started.
Let's begin with when Impressionism started.
The movement of impressionism began in the 19th century in Paris,
it was originated with a select group of artists who exhibited their work independently.
Later on, these artists became prominent in the 1870s and 1880s.
Yes! Amy?
Why is it called Impressionism?
Well, the term 'impressionism' comes from a painting by Claude Monet,
which he showed at an exhibition with the name ‚ÄúSoleil Levant‚Äù.
In English, it means Impression, Sunrise.
The name was coined by a critic, Louis Leroy.
He saw the exhibition and wrote a satirical review in which he said...
that all the paintings were just ""impressions"".
At that time, Louis Leroy and the art community were very hostile towards the new movement.
However, they soon came to recognize that these new Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision,
even though the art establishment remained disapproving.
So why did this type of art cause so much friction?
A very good question!
Obviously, the focus of the art was very different.
Think of what we had leading up to this point.
Formal portraits. Very stiff, very static...
very focused on the accuracy of line and contours.
Quite dark too.
Artists mixed colors with black to make darker shades,
and that was what resulted in that effect.
The impressionists, however, focused more on open scenes and were more interested in light and movement.
The scenes themselves were relatively ordinary.
When we think of Impressionism, our minds often jump to outdoor scenes,
and it's true that there was an abundance of these,
but there were also lives, and images of people,
but these were not traditional portraits,
these people were captured from unusual angles,
getting on with whatever they were doing,
seemingly oblivious to the fact that they were being captured.
Up until that point, even outdoor scenes had been painted indoors,
and that's why the play of light and movement didn't really register.
Now it came to the fore.
One thing that allowed this to happen was the introduction of premixed paints
that came in lead tubes, like toothpaste tubes.
Artists no longer had to laboriously grind and mix their own paints using pigments and linseed oil.
They could just take their paints outside and paint what they saw.
Or inside, for that matter.
If they saw a particularly wonderful feature of light,
they could just go ahead and capture it right away.
And I think that spontaneity is what Impressionism is all about.
Alright! Now let's look at the specific elements of Impressionist painting.
We see short brush strokes, with no effort to blend these together.
The colors aren't mixed with any gradation from light to shade.
Pure colours are put together side by side.
Our eyes do the work of mixing colors together.
But the effect that this gives is intensity, vibrancy, vibration, and...
this creates the impression of movement.
Paints are often laid on impasto - so that they stick out from the surface, not smoothed down.
Details are out.
The essence of the subject is what matters.
You have to understand that they're not looking for a photographic reproduction here.
And there's no use of black, even to create shade.
That's done by mixing complementary colors.
Other rules that were sensible to previous artists went out of the window.
Wet paint was laid on top of wet paint, no matter if it went on smudgy.
That gave a soft edge, an intermingling of colour that the impressionists were aiming for.
Glazes, that is, thin films of paint, which earlier artists used to create effects and transparent surfaces, were not used.
Impressionist painting surfaces were typically opaque.
Yes! Amy?
I've learned that France wasn't the only place where painters were getting out into the open air.
There were other painters such as the Italian artists known as the Macchiaioli
and Winslow Homer in the United States who were painting outside.
Yes! But they didn't bring in those techniques I've just been talking about.
Also, the impressionists were not the first to use these techniques, either.
Painters throughout history had occasionally used these methods.
To name a few, Rubens, Constable, and Turner.
They all incorporated some Impressionist techniques,
but it was the impressionists who brought all techniques altogether.
Impressionists such as Delacroix, Gustave Courbet, and Th√©odore Rousseau
were the French painters who led the way in French Impressionist movement.
And painters of the Barbizon school such as Th√©odore Rousseau, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Eug√®ne Boudin
were also very influential towards the Impressionists,
as they painted nature in a style that was similar to Impressionism,
and it is they who taught the younger artists who we regard as the true Impressionists.
In turn, impressionism paved the way for later styles like Neo-Impressionism,
Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism.

1366,Lecture: Theater and Film,C1,lecture-theater-and-film,80,"In the early 20th century,
when we first started to watch films instead of going to the theatre,
it became obvious that this new medium required a new style of acting.
Especially so, when they added the sound.
It was D W Griffith who first started to examine what type of acting style would work best on screen,
and that ushered in a new acting medium
that was very different from the thousands of years of theatre performances that had preceded it.
So, today we're going to look at a few of these.
The first difference is the idea that you act big on stage and small on screen.
The principle behind this is that in the theatre, some of your audience might be 100 rows back,
so, to ensure they get as much out of your performance as the people in front,
you make flamboyant gestures, over-the-top facial expressions, and exaggerated movements.
Conversely, on screen, with the camera up close,
only minute changes in facial expression are necessary to portray the character.
Although that's a good rule of thumb, I take issue with it to a certain extent.
Why? well...
Many contemporary plays are performed in little, independent theatres,
not huge auditoriums.
So, even within the stage,
you have to adapt your style between big and small,
and in fact these so-called small performances,
which are intimate and introverted,
can be very believable.
However, mixing the two styles,
we also see larger-than-life actors on film, like Johnny Depp,
whose technique, while extroverted, does produce an effective performance.
In addition to gestures, you have to consider your voice.
On stage, you have to project to the audience.
While on film, the microphone is right there,
and you can focus on making your voice more believable.
That's not to say you can mumble in a film.
Yes, you have more leeway,
and the soundman and editors can remove all sorts of blips and breaths to make your voice fit the setting.
But there's only so much they can do.
I don't know how many times I've listened to the Heath Ledgers last line of Brokeback Mountain
before I finally had to turn on the subtitles to catch a word of what he was saying.
My point here, is that you still have to enunciate in film.
Now, some people will say of film you're not acting to an audience,
and you can understand why.
In the theatre, your job is to ensure that the audience enjoy your performance.
And to some extent, you can adapt your style according to their reactions.
But to say that you are not performing to an audience in film is not strictly true.
There will be all manner of people watching you when you're in front of the cameras -
sound men, cameramen, costumers,
make-up artists, and assorted hangers-on.
As a theatre actor, the temptation is to up your voice and to act to them - for them.
Which of course you cannot do.
In film, the situation is key.
You need to respond to the scene, not what's around you.
You might think that responding naturally to a situation, is easier than all this flamboyant, larger-than-life dancing around on stage that actors have to do.
But there are some problems you have to bear in mind.
Quite often, on film, each person in a scene is shot separately,
which means you often have to respond to a line not yet spoken.
And making your responses realistic is not easy.
Additionally, the film will not be shot in sequence.
On stage, the actor can grow into his role,
and over a number of hours, the character develops naturally.
Film actors can't do that.
They have to go straight into a scene,
which might be in the middle, the end or the beginning,
and be that person, in that situation, right away,
and, obviously, that requires a certain level of skill.
On the subject of character,
there is something to be said for film actors in that they do have slightly more freedom.
Theater is by its very nature repetitive, and, therefore familiar.
Audiences often go to see a show that they know.
And they'll want those characters to behave in a certain way.
So, they'll probably notice changes to the script, or to a character,
and although they might appreciate the variety, they are more likely to object.
In television and film, the material is fresh,
and that actor is likely to be the only person ever to play a certain character.
Words are changed all the time.
Actors can make mistakes or change things around if they want to.
If it makes the character seem believable, it's acceptable.
Another argument about the different styles of acting is the idea that you can get away with things more in one medium than the other.
You can't fake it on screen, as if you can on stage.
You only get one take on stage,
while with film you keep going until you make the director happy.
There's a minimal rehearsal time on screen as it's impossible to get together with the other actors and rehearse beforehand.
What I'm saying here is that the difference between the two mediums is minuscule and really not worth arguing.

1367,Lecture: Art Movement,C1,lecture-art-movement,69,"Good afternoon everyone.
As you know, this set of lectures will look at the different movements in twentieth-century art history.
But before I start looking at some of these movements in detail,
I thought it would be helpful for you to understand exactly what we mean by the term ""movement"".
Basically, an art movement is a collective title that we give to artworks
that share the same artistic ideas, styles, or technical approaches.
Each movement occupies a specific point in history.
These time periods can span, months, years, or decades,
but normally, the movement's heyday can be pinpointed to a period of a few years.
The practice of grouping artists into movements is only seen in Western Art,
and in fact, all movements came from the twentieth century,
during the time period we call 'modern art',
which spans, more or less, from the beginning to the middle of the twentieth century.
After that, we refer to art as postmodern,
and from then on, the era of movements came to an end,
as if it was just a passing fad.
The term movement is actually pretty vague.
In some cases, the artists of one movement adhere strictly to a set of guiding principles,
but in other cases, the artists have very little in common.
Although it's sometimes based on artistic style and technique, like Art Deco,
it isn't always.
Sometimes, it is based on a particular concept or ethical belief.
Let's look at some examples of what I mean.
Let's look at Cubism, for example.
This is very much a visual approach.
Cubists wanted to discard past conventions in which art mimicked nature,
and highlight the fact that a painting is not nature,
it's just a flat two-dimensional representation of it.
To highlight this idea, Cubists painted quite common objects -
musical instruments, bottles, humans -
but depicted them from several vantage points at once;
something quite impossible in reality.
Other movements were not connected by their styles or techniques.
Instead, it was their beliefs that brought them together.
Dadaism is an example.
Dadaists believed that rational thought was responsible for the growth of corrupt,
nationalist politics, and the spread of violence and war.
They saw themselves as crusaders against this.
They used their art, for example, to protest against the nascist Nazi party in Germany.
The scale of movements varied considerably.
Some were international, while some were very small-scale,
centered around a particular city, and included a specific group of people.
Vorticism was an example of this type of small-scale, close-knit group.
The Vorticists were from London,
and the group was centered around London's Rebel Arts Center
and published its work in the London-based magazine Blast.
Its manifesto had just eleven signatories,
and there were a handful of others who contributed to the movement.
On the other hand, some movements existed on a large scale.
Dadaism, for example, comprised of a loosely-knit international network of artists
living in Zurich, New York City, Berlin, and Paris.
That's another important thing about these different art movements.
They don't just encompass the visual arts.
Art movements also encompass literature, poetry, architecture, and music.
The ideals are transferred from one art form to another.
Take Futurism, for example.
The idea of Futurism was that it embraced new technology - change, speed, and innovation.
Where painters expressed this by painting modes of transport and large crowds in vibrant, expressive colors,
to glorify the virtues of speed and dynamic movement,
writers expressed the futuristic ideal by ridding their poetry of unnecessary elements,
like adjectives and adverbs, and emphasizing the verbs.
Movements, as a whole, were short-lived.
To some extent, this can be attributed to fashion, but not always.
Some movements, like Futurism and Vorticism, that glorified technology
were seen to be a glorification of war,
as when these movements started up, World War I was just around the corner.
When it was finally realized how much destruction the new machines that they so highly praised was causing,
these movements died a death, and in some cases, their artists did too,
as a number of prominent Vorticists were killed in action.
